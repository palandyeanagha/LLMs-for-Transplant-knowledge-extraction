Hepatorenal tyrosinemia
By Teruo KITAGAWA*1,*2,†
(Communicated by Kunihiko SUZUKI, M.J.A.)
Abstract: In 1957 Sakai and Kitagawa in Japan reported the clinical and biochemical
findings in a patient with tyrosinemia, tyrosyluria, liver cirrhosis, and renal rickets. Subsequently,
reports were published from various countries of other patients with hepatorenal tyrosinemia
(HRT). 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase deficiency was originally proposed as the cause of
HRT. However, in 1977 Lindblad et al. found that succinylacetone, which accumulates in the serum
and urine from patients with HRT, inhibits delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase in vitro.
They suggested that the primary enzyme deficiency in patients with HRT was fumarylacetoacetate
hydrolase, and this was soon confirmed. Thus, the elucidation of the pathogenesis of this disease has
led to the possibility that, if a reliable newborn screening method could be developed, the prognosis
of these patients would be improved. Early treatment would require a diet low in phenylalanine and
tyrosine, administration of 2-(2-nitoro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC),
and liver transplantation.

Introduction
Hepatorenal tyrosinemia (HRT) is an autosomal
recessive inborn error of metabolism which mainly
affects the liver and kidneys. It is also known as
tyrosinemia type 1, hereditary tyrosinemia, congenital tyrosinosis, and fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase
(FAH) deficiency (FAHD), and is assigned OMIM
276700.1)
In 1932, more than 25 years before the discovery
of the clinical entity HRT, Grace Medes2),3) in the US
described the biochemical findings in a 49 year old
man with myasthenia gravis, under the title of “A
new error of tyrosine metabolism: Tyrosinosis. The
intermediary metabolism of tyrosine and phenylalanine”. Medes found an unusual reducing substance
in the urine of this patient which was identified
as 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (4-HPP). She proposed
that the defect in tyrosinosis was a deficiency of
4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (4-HPPD).
However, the patient remains an enigma, as I will
discuss later, and this condition has been assigned1)
a separate MIM number (76800).
In 1957 Sakai and Kitagawa4),5) reported the
case of a two-year-old boy with marked hepatosplenomegaly, failure to thrive, and tyrosyluria. His urine
contained a large amount of 4-hydroxyphenyllactate
(4-HPL) and a small amount of 4-HPP, 4-hydroxyphenylacetate (4-HPA) and tyrosine. The authors
proposed, on the basis of the physical findings and
biochemical observations, that the patient might
have another type of inborn error of tyrosine
metabolism, different from that in Medes’s case.
In three reports4)–6) between 1957 and 1959 we
described the clinical, biochemical and pathological
findings of this patient under the heading “An
atypical case of tyrosinosis” with the subtitle “lpara-hydroxyphenyllactic aciduria”.
In this review the present author summarizes
advances in the study of HRT, focusing on the
clinical aspects.

Recognition of hepatorenal tyrosinemia
1) Clinical features.4),5) In 1955, when I
was a junior staff member at the Department of
Pediatrics, Jikei University School of Medicine,
Tokyo (Chairman: Professor Kiyoshi Sakai) a two
year-old boy (K.O.) was admitted with marked
hepatosplenomegaly and failure to thrive (Fig. 1).
He was the second child of a consanguineous marriage
and was born normally at term on October 9, 1952,
weighing 3,900 g. His parents lived in Oshima island,
120 km from Tokyo. Their first child (male) had died
of unknown cause on the 15th day of life.
During infancy the patient showed normal
growth and development. In his second year, however, the parents noticed loss of appetite and
gradually increasing abdominal distension. There
was no history of neuromuscular abnormality. On
admission, physical examination revealed the liver
and spleen were enlarged to 5 cm and 4 cm, respectively, below the costal margin. No abnormalities
were found in the heart, lungs, skin, or eyes.
2) Laboratory investigations and diagnosis.4),5) All routine laboratory tests were normal,
except for a low serum inorganic phosphorus and
slightly elevated values of liver function tests. The
urinary Millon’s reaction consistently showed a dark
red color. The urine also showed a positive Benedict’s
test and phosphomolibdic acid reaction. Two-dimensional paper chromatography of the urinary Millon
positive compounds revealed four spots: A, B, C, and
D. The B and D spots were positive for Millon’s
reaction only. The A spot was positive for both
Millon’s and the Ninhydrin reaction. The C spot was
positive for both Millon’s and the phosphomolibdic
acid reaction.
The authors tried to isolate and identify the
Millon positive compounds. Two liters of the urine in
cold storage were concentrated under vacuum at
40°C and the residue extracted with ethyl alcohol.
The alcohol insoluble materials were removed by
centrifugation.
The supernatant solution was re-concentrated
and the residue re-extracted with alcohol. After
repeating these procedures several times the final
residue was dissolved in water and treated with an ion
exchange resin, then with activated carbon powder,
and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated at 40°C
under vacuum. Eventually, one of the Millon positive
compounds was isolated in long needle crystals.4)
This compound was strongly positive for
Millon’s reaction, and negative for the Ninhydrin
and phosphomolibdic acid reactions. Elemental
analysis showed it was nearly identical to 4-HPL.
In 1955 in Japan, only l-tyrosine was commercially available, so we had to synthesize other 4-
hydroxyphenyl compounds, such as 4-HPL, 4-HPP
and 4-HPA, in our laboratory.4) The physical and
chemical properties of the compound isolated from
the urine were compared with those of the three
synthetic specimens and found to be identical to
4-HPL (the B spot on paper chromatography).
The other three compound spots, A, C, and D, were
subsequently identified as tyrosine, 4-HPP, and
4-HPA, respectively, by paper chromatography.4)
Quantitative analysis of the Millon positive
compounds in the urine of our patient while on a
hospital diet revealed that the daily outputs of
4-HPL, tyrosine, 4-HPP, and 4-HPA were approximately 1000 mg, 350 mg, 250 mg, and 150 mg,
respectively. Following the oral ingestion of 1 g of 4-
HPP, the urinary output of 4-HPL rose markedly and
that of 4-HPA increased slightly. After the administration of 1 g of tyrosine, the output of tyrosine
and 4-HPL increased moderately while that of 4-HPP
and 4-HPA increased slightly.5)
These findings suggested that the metabolic
defect in our patient was a deficiency of 4-HPPD.
Although the mechanism of increased formation of 4-
HPL in our patient was not known, it was considered
to be due to increased enzymatic reduction of 4-HPP
to 4-HPL.

3) Clinical course and outcome.6) From April
1956 he regularly suffered from diarrhea and often
caught colds. His weight gradually decreased and
rachitic changes, including genu valgum, became
evident. Rickets was confirmed by X-ray examination. On the basis of clinical observations and
persistent hypophosphatemia, it was suspected that
he suffered from Fanconi type renal rickets, such as
cystinosis.
In December 1956 we observed that his hepatosplenomegaly was increasing and the liver felt
irregular and hard.
He contracted measles in March 1957, after
which his appetite became further reduced, vomiting
sometimes occurred, and he gradually grew weaker.
The edge of the liver and spleen were both palpable
about 8 cm below the costal margin. He was
hospitalized again November 1957. Finally, he fell
into hepatic coma and he died in November.
At autopsy, the liver showed portal cirrhosis
with malignant hepatoma. The spleen showed
fibroadeny, and tubular nephrosis was found.
With the parents’ permission, a liver biopsy
was performed one hour after death. The tyrosine
oxidation activity of the liver homogenate was found
to be only 22.4% of normal.6) From these observations, it seemed that the low activity of 4-HPPD
caused a large accumulation of 4-hydroxyphenyl
compounds in the tissues, and these were excreted
in the urine.
4) Differences between Medes’s case and our
patient. As shown in Table 1, while a deficiency
of 4-HPPD activity was proposed in both Medes’s3)
and our case,5),6) there were significant differences
between the clinical features and biochemical abnormalities in the two patients. In Medes’s patient
only 4-HPP was excreted (except on a high tyrosine
diet), whereas in our patient4),5) 4-HPL was the
major tyrosyl product in the urine. Kretchmer
et al.7),8) reported that 4-HPPD is relatively deficient
in premature infants, but if they are fed extra
tyrosine they will excrete several times as much
4-HPL as 4-HPP. Scorbutic guinea pigs9) and
children10) also excrete appreciable quantities of the
lactic derivative of the 4-hydroxyphenyl compound.
Therefore, it was difficult to understand why only
4-HPP was excreted in Medes’s case. One would
expect that if 4-HPP was present in the tissues,
reduction of a considerable amount of keto acid
to 4-HPL by lactic acid dehydrogenase11) and/or
aromatic ,-keto acid reductase12),13) would take
place.
According to the description of Tyrosinosis
(Medes) and Tyrosinosis (Sakai) by Auerbach VII
and DiGeorge AM in Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics
1975,14) although 4-HPPD deficiency was proposed in
both cases, the clinical differences between the two
cases were as follows.
Tyrosinosis (Medes): In 1932, Medes reported
a study of an adult male with a defect of tyrosine
metabolism. No symptoms could be related to the
metabolic defect. He excreted more than 1 g/day
of 4-HPP in the urine. Medes proposed that the
tyrosyluria was due to an almost complete absence
of 4-HPPD.
Tyrosinosis (Sakai): Another clinical disorder
associated with a defect in 4-HPPD in infants and
children was first described by Sakai. The onset was
usually between 1 and 6 months of age. The most
frequent clinical manifestations were failure to thrive,
irritability, fever, and hepatomegaly, with anorexia,
vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal distension being
commonly found.
5) Review of the literature (1932–1976).
Several studies of infants15),16) and adults17) with
liver cirrhosis and/or hepatospenomegaly together
with Fanconi type renal rickets appeared before our
original report was published in 1957. However,
among these patients there was no suggestion of
abnormal tyrosine metabolism.
After reading Medes’s pioneering 1932 study,3)
we were inspired to publish our report as an atypical
case of tyrosinosis. As no other cases resembling
Medes’s have emerged as far as we are aware, our
case appears to be the first report of a typical HRT
patient.

194 T. KITAGAWA [Vol. 88,

In the mid-1960s a Scandinavian group18)–23) and
a Canadian group24) published papers on the clinical
features and laboratory findings in patients with
HRT in which they also referred to our original
reports and suggested that all these patients belonged
to the same clinical entity. Also, a Scandinavian
group23) and a Canadian group24) found that hypermethioninemia occasionally occurred in patients with
HRT, especially in the acute stage.
In June 1965, L.R. Gjessing and S. Halvorsen
in Norway organized a symposium on tyrosinosis
in honour of Dr. Grace Medes. The meeting was
attended by Dr. Medes and Dr. Asbjorn Fölling,
Professor Emeritus, University of Oslo, who described the first case of phenylketonuria in 1934.
The proceedings of the symposium were published in
1966.25) Sixteen participants attended the meeting
and nine scientific lectures, including one by Medes,
were given. However, no additional information was
presented by Medes.
Another symposium on tyrosinemia, under the
title of “Conference on hereditary tyrosinemia”, was
held at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto,
Canada, in March, 1966.26)
Twenty six scientists attended the conference.
Three came from the United States and 23 were from
Canada. The lectures and case reports presented
at the conference appeared in Canadian Medical
Association J., vol. 97, 1967.
In six of these case reports, the clinical manifestations and laboratory findings of 48 patients with
HRT were presented. One paper, by Scriver, C.R.
et al.,
27) presented the clinical manifestations of four
patients with HRT whose onset was between two
and 32 months. Larochelle, J. et al.28) reported the
clinical observations of 37 infants with HRT. The
most common clinical features in those patients were
hepatomegaly, failure to thrive, fever, edema, vomiting, diarrhea, irritability, lethargy, abdominal distension, a hemorrhagic tendency, and a peculiar odor.
It is noteworthy that all these features were found in
our patient, except for the odor. It is recognised that
the odor in patients with HRT is associated with
hypermethioninemia, and this, together with aforementioned symptoms and signs, are seen frequently
in acute type HRT. It is interesting that two of the
four cases reported by Scriver et al.27) and all three
cases described by Sass-Kortsak, A. et al.29) showed
Fanconi syndrome, as in our case.
At the conference, Dr. Scriver gave a lecture
entitled “The phenotypic manifestation of hereditary
tyrosinemia and tyrosyluria: a hypothesis”. He kindly
acknowledged our original work as follows:30) “I
would like to draw attention to an excellent study
published quietly a decade ago in a university
medical journal in Japan. Sakai, Kitagawa and
Yoshioka investigated a single Japanese patient with
“tyrosinosis” and described practically everything we
have to say today. They in fact laid the foundation
for this conference.”
Laberge, C. in 196931) and Bergeron, P. et al. in
197432) reported that the incidence of HRT in the
province of Quebec, Canada was as high as one in 800
births, and DeBraekeleer et al.33) in 1990 reported
that the prevalence at birth was estimated at one in
1846 live born in the same region of Quebec, while
Kvittingen, E.A.34) described an incidence of one in
50,000 births in Scandinavia in 1986. In Quebec, the
acute form of HRT is usually diagnosed in the first
few months of life and if untreated these patients die
from liver failure within their first year of life.
In the chronic form of HRT, as described in
Scandinavia, the patients show the gradual development of liver cirrhosis as well as Fanconi type renal
rickets, and often develop hepatocellular carcinoma
in their teens.35)
Our patient was diagnosed at the age of 3 years
and died at 5 years one month of age, without
treatment. Thus, our patient may be classified as the
subchronic type of HRT.
Discovery of the pathogenesis of HRT
As described previously, 4-HPPD deficiency was
originally proposed as the cause of HRT6),21),22),36)
(Fig. 2) based on enzymatic studies of liver tissue
obtained at biopsy or autopsy. However, since 1965
there was increasing doubt that this hypothesis was
correct, and suggestions were made that the primary
metabolic defect in HRT is something other than a
lack of 4-HPPD. As mentioned before, Scandinavian
and Canadian groups19),23),24) reported that hypermethioninemia is occasionally found in patients with
acute HRT. In 1968 and 1970, Gaull et al.37),38)
described reduced activity of methionine activating
enzyme and cystathionine synthetase in these
patients, which they suggested were secondary
manifestations of an unknown hereditary metabolic
disease. It has also been reported that several
patients with HRT showed signs of polyneuropathy which resembled crises in acute intermittent
porphyria. In 1969, Gentz, J. et al.39) in a Swedish
group measured the excretion of delta-aminolevulinic
acid (ALA), porphobilinogen and porphyrins in
patients with hepatorenal tyrosinemia who had
No. 5] Hepatorenal tyrosinemia 195

attacks of polyneuropathy. They found that the
urinary ALA was about 100 times the normal level,
but urinary porphobilinogen and porphyrin were
within the normal ranges or slightly elevated.
Lindblad, B., Lindstedt, S., and Steen, G.40) in
the same group in 1977 found that ALA dehydratase
activity in erythrocytes and liver from patients with
HRT was less than 5% and 1% deficient, respectively,
compared with controls. They conjectured that the
high excretion of ALA in the urine of some patients
with HRT was due to low activity of ALA
dehydratase. Subsequently, when the serum and
urine from these patients, but not from controls,
was added to an assay for ALA dehydratase activity,
they found the enzyme activity markedly decreased.
Eventually, by gas-liquid chromatography-massspectrometry, they identified succinylacetone and
succinylacetoacetate in the urine from these patients
as the enzyme inhibitors.
From these results, they concluded that the
severe liver and kidney damage found in HRT was
due to the accumulation of these tyrosine metabolites, and that the primary enzyme defect in HRT was
decreased activity of FAH. These observations have

been confirmed by work done between 197941) and
198142),43) by direct enzyme assays. Once the primary
enzyme defect was identified as FAH, the characteristic pattern of increased urinary 4-hydroxyphenyl
compounds with absence of homogeneity, could be
attributed to secondary 4-HPPD deficiency.
As also mentioned above, two major clinical
forms of HRT have been reported: acute and chronic.
Tanguay, R.M. et al.44) demonstrated that the basic
defect in the acute form is due to the absence of
enzymatically and immunologically measurable activity of FAH in the liver and kidneys.
It has been reported that residual FAH immunoreactivity in liver extracts of patients with chronic
HRT correlates with their enzyme activity measured
by hydrolysis of fumarylacetoacetate. These observations suggest that the two forms of HRT are the
result of different molecular defects.
It is interesting that soon after the primary
enzyme defect in HRT was confirmed, two patients
with a new form of hereditary tyrosinemia with primary 4-HPPD defect were identified in 1983 independently in the US45) and Japan.46) This disease was
assigned MIM 276710 and called tyrosinemia type III.
Tyrosinemia and tyrosyluria are two of the
important indicators in the biochemical phenotype
of patients with HRT. However, an accumulation
of tyrosine and its early metabolites, such as 4-
hydroxyphenyl compounds, are unlikely to cause
the hepatorenal symptoms. In contrast, it has been
known that FAH deficiency may cause accumulation
of maleylacetoacetate (MAA) and fumarylacetoacetate (FAA) and their derivatives, such as succinylacetoacetic acid (SAA) and succinylacetone (SA),
and these may cause the hepatorenal features.
Laboratory findings, diagnosis and treatment
1) Laboratory findings and diagnosis. Hypertyrosinemia and tyrosyluria are the most common
findings, but hypermethioneima and increased excretion of ALA in the urine are occasionally detected,
especially in the acute stage. Another important
feature is renal rickets associated with hyperphosphaturia and hypophosphatemia due to reduced
tubular reabsorption of phosphorus. Other signs of
renal dysfunction are glucosuria, proteinuria, and
hyperaminoaciduria (renal Fanconi syndrome).
Coagulation factors produced in the liver are
reduced, and there is a bleeding tendency and
moderate anemia. In the acute stage, patients show
hypoproteinemia, hyperbilirubinemia, deterioration
of liver function and occasionally polyneuropathic
pain. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are usually
present in the chronic phase.
The ,-fetoprotein level is raised in the acute and
in chronic stages, especially with the development of
hepatocellular carcinoma, and the serum transaminases
are increased, particularly in acute hepatic episodes.
The plasma tyrosine level has less diagnostic
value than the elevated concentration of succinylacetone in the blood or urine and the reduced level of
fumarylacetoacetase in the blood. In neonatal screening by measuring the blood tyrosine level, only a
minority of patients with HRT are identified. A more
reliable way to identify these patients would be to
measure fumarylacetoacetase using ELISA47) or to
determine succinylacetone using UPLC-MS/MS in
dried blood spots from newborn infants.48)
If it became practicable to measure succinylacetone or fumarylacetoacetase as part of a newborn
screening program, this might lead to an improved
prognosis of patients with HRT.
2) Treatment. A low phenylalanine and
tyrosine diet for HRT patients was introduced by
Halvorsen and Gjessing in 196420) and for a long time
was the only treatment available. It had a beneficial
effect on the renal tubular defects, but did not cure
the liver disease.
After the discovery of FAH deficiency as the
primary defect in HRT, tratment with NTBC (2-(2-
nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cycloxanedione),
which is a potent inhibitor of 4-HPPD and reduces
the accumulation of harmful tyrosine metabolites,
was introduced by Lindstedt, S. et al. in 1992.49) This
treatment may prevent acute hepatic crises. Patients
treated with NTBC are also prescribed a diet low in
phenylalanine and tyrosine.
In 2010, Schlump, J.-U. et al.50) reported that a
significant increase in succinylacetone was observed
within the first 12 hours of life in a newborn baby
with HRT without treatment. It may be necessary
to make an early diagnosis and start the treatment.
It appeared that NTBC slowed progression of the
disease, but the liver damage was irreversible and
patients must be followed for the development of
hepatocellular carcinoma. Recent reports, however,
indicate that the results of treatment with NTBC
are considerably better than had been expected:51),52)
succinylacetone may become undetectable in the
urine and ,-fetoprotein is maintained in the normal
range during this treatment. However, long term
follow-up is needed to confirm these results.
In an overview of HRT by Kvittingen in 1986,34)
the case of a patient with HRT is described who was
No. 5] Hepatorenal tyrosinemia 197

treated in 1978 with a liver transplant performed by
Fisch et al. The patient died three months later but
the biochemical derangements apparently improved.
Subsequently, the use of liver transplants in HRT cases
has increased and the benefits appear to be confirmed.
Paradis et al.53) reported in 1990 that six out of seven
patients who received liver transplants survived with
normal liver function and growth on a normal diet.
Thus, liver transplantation seems to be an effective
treatment and it may reduce the risk of hepatocellular
carcinoma.54) However, long term follow-up of the
patients with HRT treated with liver trasplantation
may be neccessary to confirm the results.
Conclusion
Following our first report of a typical patient
with HRT in 1957 and the identification in 1977
by Lindblad et al. of the primary enzyme defect,
effective treatment is now a possibility if the
condition is detected early. It would require the
combination of NTBC therapy, a low phenylalanine
and tyrosine diet, and liver transplantation.

Profile
Teruo Kitagawa was born in Tokyo in 1926. He graduated from Tokyo Jikei
University School of Medicine in 1950. From 1952 to 1957, he received postgraduate
training at the Department of Pediatrics, Tokyo Jikei University School of Medicine and
he obtained a Ph.D. in 1957. During his training he had the opportunity to see patients
with various inherited metabolic disorders such as congenital erythropoietic porphyria,
hepatorenal tyrosinemia and others. Thus, he became interested in the study of inherited
metabolic disorders. In 1959, he was appointed to Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at
Tokyo Jikei University. From 1960–61, he was a post-doctoral fellow at the Oncology
Research Institute of Wisconsin University where he studied tryptophan metabolism,
and from 1961–62, he was a post-doctoral fellow at the Thannhauser Memorial Institute
at Tafts University School of Medicine where he studied inborn errors of lipid metabolism. In 1966, he was
appointed to Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Tokyo Jikei University. In 1971, he was promoted to Professor of
Pediatrics at Nihon University School of Medicine. In 1974, Teruo Kitagawa developed a mass-screening system for
inborn errors of metabolism in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area in collaboration with the Tokyo Obstetrician
Association and Tokyo Health Service Association. From 1977 to 1993, he was the Chairman of the Committee of
Newborn Screening for Inborn Errors of Metabolism in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area conducted by the Department
of Maternal and Child Health of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.
From 1980 to the present, he has been the Chairman of the Committee on the Study and Development of
Special Dietary Products for the Treatment of Inborn Errors of Metabolism. The main activity of the committee is
the development of new products and the keeping of a stable supply of formula for the treatment of inborn errors of
metabolism. These activities have contributed to the prevention of mental retardation as well as other disabilities
which are caused by inherited metabolic disorders.
In 1986, Teruo Kitagawa received the Memorial Award from the Japanese Society for Human Genetics and
was appointed to Chairman and Professor of Pediatrics, Nihon University School of Medicine. In 1992, Teruo
Kitagawa received the Medal with Purple Ribbon from the Japanese Government for excellence in pediatric
research and he was promoted to Professor of Institute of Medical Sciences, Nihon University School of Medicine. In
1994, he was appointed to Vice President of Kokusai Gakuin Saitama Junior College, and Emeritus Professor of
Nihon University. Since 1997, Teruo Kitagawa has been the Chairman of the Board of Directors, Tokyo Health
Service Association.
