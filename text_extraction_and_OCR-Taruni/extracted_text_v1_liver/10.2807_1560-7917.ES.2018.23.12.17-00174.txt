Background: Previous studies showed low levels of 
circulating hepatitis E virus (HEV) in Scotland. We 
aimed to reassess current Scottish HEV epidemiology. Methods: Blood donor samples from five Scottish 
blood centres, the minipools for routine HEV screening and liver transplant recipients were tested for 
HEV antibodies and RNA to determine seroprevalence 
and viraemia. Blood donor data were compared with 
results from previous studies covering 2004–08. 
Notified laboratory-confirmed hepatitis E cases 
(2009-16) were extracted from national surveillance 
data. Viraemic samples from blood donors (2016) and 
chronic hepatitis E transplant patients (2014–16) were 
sequenced.  Results:  Anti-HEV IgG seroprevalence 
varied geographically and was highest in Edinburgh 
where it increased from 4.5% in 2004–08) to 9.3% in 
2014–15 (p=0.001). It was most marked in donors <35 
years. HEV RNA was found in 1:2,481 donors, compared with 1:14,520 in 2011. Notified laboratoryconfirmed cases increased by a factor of 15 between 
2011 and 2016, from 13 to 206. In 2011–13, 1 of 329 
transplant recipients tested positive for acute HEV, 
compared with six cases of chronic infection during 
2014–16. Of 10 sequenced viraemic donors eight and 
all six patients were infected with genotype 3 clade 
1 virus, common in European pigs.  Conclusions:  The 
seroprevalence, number of viraemic donors and numbers of notified laboratory-confirmed cases of HEV in 
Scotland have all recently increased. The causes of 
this change are unknown, but need further investigation. Clinicians in Scotland, particularly those caring 
for immunocompromised patients, should have a low 
threshold for testing for HEV.
Introduction 
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is now increasingly recognised 
in industrialised countries, where it causes acute infection, and chronic infection in immunosuppressed individuals, including transplant recipients [1,2]. In Europe, 
locally acquired hepatitis E is predominantly a porcine 
zoonosis associated with HEV genotypes (gt) 3 and 
4. Around 70% of individuals exposed to HEV gt3 are 
asymptomatic [3]. In many industrialised countries 
infection with HEV is more common than previously 
thought. For instance, based on blood donor data from 
South East England, there are an estimated 100,000 
human infections each year in England [4]. Because 
HEV infection is common and commonly asymptomatic, HEV has found its way into the blood supply, 
with frequency of viraemic donations between 1:600 
to 1:14520 [5-7] and recently some countries (France, 
Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands) have started or are 
considering the implementation of HEV RNA donation 
screening [8,9]. This includes the United Kingdom (UK), 
which introduced screening of donations destined for 
‘high-risk’ recipients (solid organ and haematological stem cell transplant recipients, neonates) [10] in 
February 2016 and universal screening in March 2017.
Anti-HEV IgG seroprevalence and incidence of hepatitis E varies both between and within countries, and 
over time. For example, in south-west (SW) France, one 
study has found a seroprevalence of 52% and incidence 
of hepatitis E of 3% [11]. Although HEV appears to be 
hyperendemic in SW France, seroprevalence varies considerably between French departments (range: 8–86%) 
[12]. The reason for this observation is unknown, but 

2 www.eurosurveillance.org
could be related to geographical differences in dietary 
habits. In contrast, seroprevalence in Scotland, first 
assessed for the period 2004–08, was found to be 
4.7% [5]. In recent years the number of cases of hepatitis E documented in many European countries, including Scotland, has increased, mostly due to improved 
testing and case ascertainment. However, there is evidence that points to a recent genuine increase in incidence in some European countries [6,12-16].
Compared with many European countries, previously 
reported Scottish seroprevalence data and rates of 
viraemia in blood donors were low [5]. In an earlier 
study, donors were sampled during 2004–08 and were 
mainly from the Edinburgh area. However, figures for 
the rest of Scotland and recent changes in seroprevalence and numbers of viraemic blood donors are 
unknown. The aims of this study were to determine the 
recent seroprevalence in differing geographical areas 
of Scotland and if there has been a change in recent 
years and to cross reference this with the current numbers of viraemic donors and laboratory-confirmed 
cases, including those in the Scottish liver transplant 
population.
Methods 
Study population and laboratory tests 
performed
An overview of the different data sets and periods 
covered that were included in this study together with 
laboratory tests performed is given in Table 1. Further 
details are described in specific sections hereafter.
Case definitions
A case of acute hepatitis E was defined as: anti-HEV 
IgM and IgG positive and/or HEV RNA detection by 
RT-PCR. A case of chronic hepatitis E was defined as: 
HEV RNA detected by PCR in serum and/or stool persisting for a minimum of 3 months. A case of previous 
HEV infection was defined as: anti-HEV IgG positive, 
and anti-HEV IgM negative.
Blood donor serology samples
Following donor consent, plasma samples were 
obtained from the Scottish National Blood Transfusion 
Service (SNBTS) research anonymous archive, a project allowing epidemiological surveillance/look-back 
in Scottish blood donors. Samples were collected from 
August 2014 to September 2015 at the five existing 
blood collection centres in Scotland. Data provided 
with the samples were age, sex, first part of post code 
and whether the donor was a repeat or first-time donor. 
The serology data were analysed in two ways. First, we 
compared the anti-HEV seroprevalence in Edinburgh, 
with our previous data (2004–08) from the same area 
[5] using the same serological assay to determine 
changes over time. Second, we compared the antiHEV seroprevalence by geographical region across 
Scotland.
Sera were tested for anti-HEV IgG using the Wantai 
kit (Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co, 
Beijing, China), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Borderline results were treated as negative.
Blood donor RNA screening samples
As part of the national screening programme, a proportion of Scottish blood donors were tested for HEV RNA 
from February 2016 and all donations from March 2017. 
In general, collections were geographically aligned 
with population demographics, with more donations 
collected in the central belt (i.e. the densely populated area between Glasgow and Edinburgh). There 
was no significant blood group bias (data not shown). 
We report the first 15 months of data generated by the 
screening programme in Scotland, i.e. February 2016 to 
May 2017.
Samples from blood donors in the screening programme were tested in pools of 24 donations using 
the Cobas HEV test on the Cobas 6800 system (Roche, 
Pleasanton, United States (US)). Confirmatory testing 
involved testing for HEV RNA and anti-HEV IgG and 
IgM. Nucleic acid was extracted on an EasyMAG semiautomated nucleic extraction system (Biomerieux, 
Marcy l’Etoile, France) followed by the individual donation amplification and detection using the ampliCube 
HEV 2.0 kit (Mikrogen Diagnostik, Neuried, Germany). 
Samples containing HEV RNA were sequenced as 
described below.HEV NAT screening of blood donations is performed in pools of 24 donations using the 
cobas HEV test on the cobas 6800 system (Roche). 
Confirmatory testing involves testing for HEV RNA and 
HEV IgG and IgM antibodies. Nucleic acid is extracted

Notified laboratory-confirmed cases
HEV is a notifiable infection in Scotland and Health 
Protection Scotland publishes the number of laboratory-confirmed cases each year as part of routine 
national surveillance [17,18]. Data from 2009 onwards 
were included in the study.
Hepatitis E cases in Scottish liver transplant recipients
Liver transplant recipients attending the Scottish Liver 
Transplant Unit for routine post-transplant follow-up 
during 2011–13 were tested for HEV in a cross-sectional 
cohort study. Following informed consent, a blood sample was taken and stored at −700C until tested. From 
2014 onwards, liver transplant recipients were tested 
for HEV when clinically indicated. The indications for 
HEV testing in such patients included persistently 
raised transaminase levels, suspected drug-induced 
liver injury and hepatitis on liver biopsy which was otherwise unexplained.

RT-PCR, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of 
positive blood donor and liver transplant recipient 
samples
Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was performed using 
the Access RT-PCR System and nested PCR using GoTaq 
(Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, US). Primers 3156 
and 3157 [19] for the primary reaction and 3158 [19] 
and TAQR [5] for the secondary reaction and the amplification conditions were as described [19]. Amplified 
DNA was gel-purified using QIAEX II gel extraction 
kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and sequenced using 
Mix2Seq kit (Eurofins, Wolverhampton, UK). The 
sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis were 
carried out using Mega7 package [20,21]. 358 base pair 
(bp) sequences corresponding to the nested PCR product, and a set shortened to 219 bp, allowing inclusion 
of the shorter three sequences from our first study [5] 
and from donor 4. Ten viraemic donor samples and six 
patient samples were sequenced as at October 2016.
In addition, four overlapping regions were amplified 
from a plasma sample of an acutely infected transplant 
recipient and an implicated blood donor sample using 
LA Taq reagents (Clontech, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, UK) 
and primers as described [22]. Multiple overlapping 
reads were assembled using DNA Dragon (Sequentix, 
Klein Raden, Germany).
Ethics
Ethical permission was obtained from the Scottish 
Medical Research and Ethics Committee 10/
MREC/00/74, West of Scotland Research Ethics 
Committee (15/WS/0081) and the SNBTS sample governance committee.
Statistics
Chi-squared test and chi-squared test for trend or 
Fisher’s exact test were performed, as indicated, to 
compare proportions of seropositive samples in different groups using GraphPad Prism version 7.01 for 
Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla California US).
Results 
Blood donor seroprevalence
One thousand seven hundred and fourteen blood 
donor samples (835 female, 879 male donors) were 
included from Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow 
and Inverness, (Table 2). Of these, 104 were HEV IgG 
seropositive (50 female, 54 male donors), giving an 
overall seroprevalence of 6.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 5.0–7.3). There was no difference between the 
seropositivity of male and female donors (6.1%; 95% 
CI: 4.6–7.9 and 6.0%; 95% CI: 4.5–7.8, respectively).

There was a significant variation of seroprevalence 
between some of the donor centres (Table 2). It was 
higher in Edinburgh (8.4%) and Dundee (7.6%), compared with Aberdeen (3.7%), Glasgow (4.3%) and 
Inverness (5.5%). Seroprevalence by age (Figure 1) 
demonstrated somewhat different patterns from the 
usual gradual increase from the youngest to oldest 
blood donors. Seroprevalence among donors in the 
25–34 year age group was higher than in next two age 
groups (35–44 and 45–54-year-olds) in Edinburgh, 
Inverness and Dundee, and the seroprevalence in 
over the 55 year-olds age group was not the highest in 
Glasgow and Inverness.
During the years 2004–08, the seroprevalence in 
Edinburgh residents was 4.5% (95% CI: 3.5–5.8) 
increasing to 9.3% (95% CI: 4.3–20.2) in the period 
2014–15 (p=0.001, Figure 2).
Increases in seroprevalence were mainly seen in 
younger donors, with increases of 9.5 times in 
15–24-year-olds and 3.7 times for 25–34 year age group 
(Figure 2). The combined seroprevalence in donors <35 
years of age increased fivefold between 2004 and 2008 
(2.0%; 95% CI: 0.1–8.1) and 2014–15 (9.8%; 95% CI: 
4.3–20.2; p=0.0005). The seroprevalence in the 25–34 
year-olds in 2014–15 crossed the overall seroprevalence (all ages) for the same time period, indicating 
increased exposure to HEV in this age group compared 
with the rest of the cohort. The proportion of seropositive donors who were aged>35 years decreased from 
85% in 2004–08 to 77% in 2014–15.
Hepatitis E viraemia in screened donors
Nucleic acid testing of 94,302 blood donations (51,388 
from selective testing February 2016 to February 2017 
and 42,914 from universal testing March to May 2017) 
detected HEV RNA in 38 donors (1:2,481), of which 23 
(1:2,234) were detected during selective screening and 
15 (1:2,860) during universal screening. Of these donors, 
29 had negative anti-HEV serology, eight were positive 
for both anti-HEV IgG and IgM and one had HEV IgM 
antibodies only. The mean age of the viraemic donors 
was 44 years and 6 months (median 47 years; range 
21–69) and three donors were less than 30 years old. 
Twenty-one of the viraemic donors resided in an area 
with a Glasgow post code, the remaining 17 donated 
at Edinburgh (n=8), Dundee (n=6) and Aberdeen (n=3) 
centres. No positive donations collected at Inverness 
centre were detected up until May 2017. More HEV 
infections were detected in male donors (n=27) than 
female donors (n=11). Sequence analysis was possible 
for 10 of these donations (see below).

Notified laboratory-confirmed cases of 
hepatitis E in Scotland
There has been a rapid increase in the annual incidence of laboratory-confirmed cases of hepatitis E 
from 13 cases in 2011 to 206 cases in 2016 (Figure 3A), 
giving a current overall incidence rate of hepatitis E in 
Scotland of 3.8 cases per 100,000 population, with a 
predominance of infection in older males (Figure 3B). In 
2015, there were 124 (67.6%) male cases and of these 
61 (45.4%) were aged 65 years and older [17,18].
Number of hepatitis E virus tests performed
Data on the number of HEV tests performed were only 
available from Edinburgh. In 2010–11, 243 patients 
were tested for HEV. Of these, 10 (4.3%) fulfilled our 
case definition. In contrast, in 2016, 1,153 patients 
were tested for HEV. Of these, 74 (6.4%) fulfilled our 
case definition.
Hepatitis E cases in Scottish liver transplant 
recipients
In 2011–13, a total of 329 Scottish liver transplant 
recipients were tested for HEV by serology and PCR. 
Patients ranged in age from 18 to 85 years (mean: 56.4;

SD 13.6) with a male to female ratio of 1:1.07. The time 
post-transplant was up to 20 years (mean: 5.0; SD: 5.3). 
No case of chronic HEV infection was documented.
In contrast, between 2014 and 2016, six patients 
were identified with chronic HEV infection following 
liver transplantation in Scotland. HEV infection was 
diagnosed between 5 to 105 months following liver 
transplantation. In four of these patients, a trial of 
immunosuppression reduction was undertaken, in an 
attempt to prompt clearance of HEV, which was successful in one case. Five patients, including three still 
on reduced immunosuppression, required antiviral 
therapy with ribavirin, and successful viral clearance 
was achieved in four cases.
One case of acute hepatitis E was found in 2012, in a 
recipient 68 days post-liver transplant. He had no symptoms of hepatitis and samples taken earlier confirmed 
that the recipient was HEV RNA-negative before transplantation. Evidence of HEV infection in the donated 
liver was absent. The recipient had received 32 blood 
components (37 donor exposures) during transplant 
surgery and examination of archived samples from 
these blood components identified a donor of fresh 
frozen plasma with active HEV infection (HEV IgM and 
HEV RNA positive, HEV IgG negative). Phylogenetic 
analysis of the sequence HEV species from the HEV 
RNA-positive blood donation and the liver transplant 
patient revealed gt3, clade 1/group 2 virus (GenBank 
accession number KT159771). Highly conserved match 
between the virus from the donor and patient (99.6–
99.8% homology), indicated a transfusion transmitted 
infection.
Sequencing data
Eight of ten donor sequences and all six 2014 to 2016 
liver transplant recipients’ sequences grouped with gt 
3 clade 1/group 2. Sequencing data from the donors 
and patients are shown in Figure 4. 
Discussion
The data presented here suggest that there has been 
a significant and recent increase in circulating HEV 
in Scotland. Analysis of samples from blood donors 
showed that the number of viraemic donors rose from 
1:14,520 to 1:2,481 from 2011 to 2016-17, accompanied 
by a rise in seroprevalence in Edinburgh, particularly in 
younger donors. Between 2011 and 2016, the number 
of notified laboratory-confirmed HEV cases increased 
by a factor of 15. Prior to 2014, no case of chronic infection was found in the Scottish liver transplant recipient population. In 2014 to 2016, however, six cases of 
chronic infection were documented. In Edinburgh, both 
the number of cases tested for HEV and the percentage 
of positive tests increased. This suggests that, in addition to increased clinician awareness and testing, there 
was a true increase in circulating HEV in humans, at 
least in Edinburgh.
Two of the more intriguing outcomes of this study 
relate to the unexpected increase in seroprevalence 
in younger donors in Edinburgh and viraemia rates in 
screened blood donors from the general Scottish blood 
donor cohort. Taken together, these data suggest that 
there may be more circulating HEV in the Scottish 
community than hitherto was the case. The reason 
for this change is uncertain, but increases in incidence/seroprevalence have recently also been seen 
in England [15], France [12] and most compellingly, the 
Netherlands where the seroprevalence in young adults 
has increased steeply and the number of viraemic 
donors moved up from 1:2,671 in 2011 [23] to 1:600 in 
2014 [6].
In England and Wales, temporally-related to the 
increase in incidence, strains of HEV gt3 recovered 
from humans have also changed. Previously, HEV in 
human cases bore close sequence homology to UK pigs 
(gt3 e,f,g; clade 2/group 1, but more recently appears 
to be mostly similar to HEV gt3 found in pigs in the UK 
and continental Europe (gt3 a,b,c,h,i,j; clade 1/group 
2) [15,24,25]. The sequencing data presented in the 
current paper shows that HEV isolated from Scottish 
donors and patients were largely gt3 clade 1/group 2. 
One possibility to account for these observations could 
be imported HEV-contaminated foodstuffs from abroad 
i.e. continental Europe. However, recent sequence data 
from pigs in Scotland are scarce and the source and 
route of infection in studied patients and blood donors 
in Scotland remain uncertain. A study in England and 
Wales, by Said et al. suggested that recent human 
infections with HEV gt3 clade 1/group 2 may largely 
be due to consumption of food products from a single 
national supermarket chain [26]. Some of the possible 
speculative reasons for the increased seroprevalence

in younger Scottish donors include a preferred choice 
of certain foodstuffs in younger people and/or ways of 
preparation, perhaps favouring faster cooking, including food preparation during outdoor social activities.
The findings suggesting that considerable amounts of 
HEV circulate in the Scottish community, need to be 
considered in the light of previous studies. Previously, 
anti-HEV IgG seroprevalence in Scotland was very low 
by European standards (4.7%), viraemic donors were 
uncommon (1:14,520) and numbers of notified laboratory-confirmed cases were very low before 2011. 
Analyses from the west of Scotland (2008–09) showed 
that only two of 316 patients with unexplained hepatitis had hepatitis E (data not shown). Prior to 2014, 
no cases of chronic infection were documented in the 
Scottish liver transplant population, but in the last two 
years, six cases of chronic infection with HEV have 
been documented, only five of which have meanwhile 
achieved viral clearance. These data underscore the 
clinical relevance of hepatitis E in immunosuppressed 
patients.
As has been shown elsewhere, we also found that HEV 
seroprevalence varied geographically within Scotland. 
In France, the overall seroprevalence is higher than 
that seen in Scotland and is highest in south-western, 
southern and north-eastern France [12]. In Scotland, the 
seroprevalence is highest in Edinburgh (8.4% overall; 
SE Scotland) and lowest in Aberdeen (3.7% overall; NE 
Scotland). The reason for such differences is unknown. 
It seems unlikely to be due to local environmental contamination from HEV-containing porcine faeces, as the 
main pig-rearing area in Scotland is Aberdeenshire [27] 
and in France it is Brittany, both of which have relatively 
modest anti-HEV IgG seroprevalence compared with 
other areas in the respective countries. It seems more 
likely that differences in seroprevalence are related 
to regional differences in exposure to contaminated 
products in the food chain. In France, local culinary 
delicacies include figatellu and air-dried Toulousean 
pig liver sausage. Both of these have been reported 
to be linked to HEV infection via consumption, with 
HEV detected sometimes at high viral loads [11,28]. 
Consumption of these foodstuffs are highest in southern France, which may account (at least in part) for the 
very high seroprevalence in this region. Although HEV 
has been found in Scottish pigs [29] and shellfish [30], 
differences in local culinary culture in Scotland are perhaps less marked than in France, and much of the food 
supply chain (i.e. via supermarkets) is on a national 
scale and so the reason(s) for regional differences in 
seroprevalence remains unclear. It is of note that the 
total pig herd in Scotland decreased from 470,000 in 
2005 to 318,000 in 2015 (a drop of 32%) [27]. Although 
seroprevalence varies by location in Scotland, viraemic donors were found from diverse locations from 
across the country, and the increased seroprevalence 
in young adults was common to most of the locations 
where donors were tested. Taken together, these data 
suggest that the increase in circulating HEV we have 
documented may be a national rather than regional 
phenomenon.
The current study has a number of limitations. There 
are few current sequencing data on HEV in Scottish 
pigs, so we cannot be certain that imported pork from 
abroad is the source of infection, as was hypothesised 
to be the case in England and Wales. Furthermore, 
we have no data on travel history in the patients and 
donors. We have only presented data on the change of 
seroprevalence in Edinburgh, and we cannot be certain 
that the finding of increased viral occurrence in humans 
in this locality is a national phenomenon across the

HEV from donors (D) in 2016 and liver transplant patients (P) infected in 2014–16. KC477203–205: sequences of positive samples from donor minipools collected in 2011 [5]. 
The evolutionary history was inferred by using the maximum likelihood method based on the Tamura-Nei model [20]. The tree with the highest log likelihood (-3861.1232) 
is shown. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying neighbour-joining and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated 
using the maximum composite likelihood (MCL) approach, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths 
measured in the number of substitutions per site. The analysis involved 55 nt sequences. Codon positions included were 1st+2nd+3rd+non-coding. All positions containing 
gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 219 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA7 [21]. GenBank accession 
numbers for donor and chronic HEV patients’ sequences are KY197769–83. Phylogenetic trees based on longer, 324 and 358 bp sequences (excluding shorter KC477203–
205 [5] and D4 sequences) gave the same pattern.

rest of Scotland. Notified laboratory-confirmed cases 
are well known to underestimate the true number of 
infections with any microorganism. This is particularly 
so for infection with HEV which is frequently asymptomatic. Although a highly sensitive and specific serology assay was applied across all tested groups, results 
obtained by PCR were more heterogeneous. To determine viraemic donations, two methods in minipools of 
24 were used: in-house method in a 2013 study [5], and 
a commercial Roche assay (see Methods), in this study. 
Since the commercial assay is more sensitive, we 
have checked the detection capability of the in-house 
method using the first 20 positive samples detected in 
the course of routine testing by the commercial assay. 
Seventeen of 20 positive results were confirmed by the 
in-house method, indicating that the reported sharp 
increase in number of viraemic donations was not simply due to the use of different methods.
Finally, our clinical data from the transplant population 
are rather heterogeneous and since 2014 have relied 
on clinician awareness, which almost certainly varies 
from clinician to clinician. Our findings should thus be 
approached with these limitations in mind.
Conclusion 
The current situation in Scotland is unique with high 
levels of circulating virus in a largely HEV-naïve population. The source(s) and route(s) of infection in Scotland 
are unknown and require further epidemiological 
investigation. Increased numbers of infection are 
already occurring, which are likely to be mostly asymptomatic, but not necessarily without clinical impact, as 
demonstrated by the data on six chronic infections in 
Scottish liver transplant recipients in the years 2014–
2016. Clinicians in Scotland, particularly those caring 
for immunocompromised patients, should have a low 
threshold for testing patients for HEV.
