Abstract
Introduction Hepatic hemangioendothelioma (HEH) is a vascular neoplasm with intermediate malignant potential.
Outcomes after liver transplantation have only been reported as small, single-institution experiences. The purpose of this
study was to evaluate patient and allograft survivals after liver transplantation in a large, multi-institutional cohort of
patients with HEH.
Methods Using the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database, we identified 110 patients with a diagnosis of
HEH who underwent 126 transplants between 1987 and 2005. Patient and allograft survivals were calculated using Kaplan–
Meier survival curves. Log rank tests were used to determine the influence of study variables on outcomes.
Results Of the 110 transplanted patients, 75 patients (68%) were female, 80 patients (73%) were Caucasian, and the median
age was 36 years old (23% < 4 y.o., 71% > 18 y.o.). The 30-day posttransplant mortality rate was 2.4%. At a median patient
follow-up interval of 24 months, 1- and 5-year patient and allograft survivals were 80% and 64%, and 70% and 55%,
respectively. Pretransplant medical status, but not age, was found to statistically correlate with patient survival.
Conclusion These data indicate that survivals after transplantation for HEH are favorable. Given the propensity for
recurrence after resection, these data support consideration of liver transplantation for all patients with significant
intrahepatic tumor burden.

Introduction
Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is a rare tumor of
vascular origin that can involve soft tissues as well as
visceral organs, including the liver, lung, spleen, stomach,
and heart. Hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma
(HEH) is a common clinical form of the disease. The
presentation of HEH, and the corresponding clinical course
can vary widely. Some HEH tumors behave similar to
benign hepatic hemangiomas, whereas others have a
clinical course resembling highly aggressive angiosarcoma.
Some patients with hepatic HEH will present with
limited intrahepatic disease; however, the majority have
multifocal disease at diagnosis with extensive intrahepatic
tumor burden and/or extrahepatic metastases. In a recent
review of 434 HEH cases reported in the world literature,
87% of patients presented with bilobar and multifocal
disease, and 37% of patients presented with extrahepatic
involvement, including secondary disease of the lungs,
regional lymph nodes, peritoneum, bone, spleen, and
diaphragm.1 Patients with extensive intrahepatic and extrahepatic tumor burden tend to have a more fulminate course,
with rapid disease progression and secondary end-organ
dysfunction.

Patients with the less common presentation of limited
intrahepatic disease are candidates for hepatectomy or other
local treatments. For patients with limited intrahepatic
disease, the overall recurrence rates observed after limited
local treatments appear to be acceptable.1 However,
aggressive recurrence has been reported after minor hepatic
resection of presumed localized disease,2 as well as after
major hepatic resection of multifocal disease.3
The frequent treatment failures observed after local
therapy has prompted the use of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in selected cases.4–9 For patients with
unresectable intrahepatic disease with or without extrahepatic disease, OLT combined with systemic therapy is the
only treatment option. Single center studies reporting on
outcomes after OLT in patients with extensive tumor
burden, have documented favorable outcomes after transplantation with 5-year survivals ranging from 48% to
76%.7–9 Even in patients with known extrahepatic disease,
OLT can prolong survival by preventing death from liver
failure.1,10
The best treatment strategy for patients with borderline
resectable HEH has not been determined. To assess the
utility of OLT in patients with extensive intrahepatic
disease, this study evaluated patient and graft survivals
after transplantation in a large, multi-institutional cohort of
patients with HEH.
Material and Methods
Analysis of the United Network for Organ Sharing
(UNOS)/Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network
(OPTN) database identified 110 patients with a diagnosis of
HEH who underwent a total of 126 transplants between
1987 and 2005. The majority of patients received their
initial transplant during the more recent 10-year period
from 1996 to 2005 (77 patients, 70%).
Examined study variables included recipient age, race,
gender, ABO blood group, era of transplant, pretransplant
medical status, patient and allograft survivals, and cause of
allograft failure or death (cancer-related vs. other causes).
Kaplan–Meier survival curves were used to calculate
survivals and log-rank tests were used to determine the
influence of study variables on survivals. A p value<0.05
was considered statistically significant.
Results
Demographic Data
Of the 110 patients transplanted for HEH, 75 patients (68%)
were female. The most frequent race was Caucasian (73%),
followed by Hispanic (13%), African American (8%), and
Asian (6%) (Table 1). The median age at the time of first
transplant was 36 years (range 0–70 years). There were 25
patients less than 4 years old and seven patients between
the ages of 4 and 18 at the time of first transplant. During
the study period, the number of OLTs performed per year
in the US for HEH has increased, peaking at 16 in 2002.
This progression is documented in Fig. 1.
Pretransplant Medical Condition
The median wait list time before the first transplant was
36 days (range 0–2,655 days). The blood group distribution
of recipients was O: 47 patients, A: 40 patients, B: 17
patients, and AB: 6 patients. At the time of the first
transplant 43 of the 110 patients (39%) were hospitalized
and 21 of these 43 patients were in an intensive care unit.
Twenty-five patients were listed as Status 1 at the time of
transplant. Of the 110 study patients, 92 (84%) were
transplanted before 2002 (i.e., before utilization of the
Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD)/Pediatric Endstage Liver Disease (PELD) scoring system). For the 18

patients transplanted in the MELD/PELD era the median
score was 27 (range 6–40). Biochemical parameters at the
time of OLT for all study patients are recorded in Table 1.
Patient Survivals
The median length of posttransplant hospitalization was
16 days (range 0–156 days). There was one operative death,
and two patients died within 30 days of transplant, yielding
a 30-day mortality rate of 2.4%. At a median patient
follow-up interval of 24 months (range 0–181 months), the
1-year, 3-year, and 5-year overall patient survivals were
80%, 68%, and 64%, respectively (Fig. 2). There were 31
actual 5-year survivors. Of the 38 patients who died during
follow-up, 12 patients (32%) died of recurrent HEH, mainly
involving distant sites.
Allograft Survivals
After first OLT, 12 patients (11%) required retransplantation, including four patients who received a third graft. Of
the 17 operations for retransplantation, 10 (59%) were
performed within 30 days of the previous operation. The
indications for retransplant were available in 14 cases and
included primary nonfunction (four transplants), vascular

thrombosis (three transplants), and biliary complications
(two transplants). At a median allograft follow-up interval
of 23 months (range 0–181 months), the 1-year, 3-year, and
5-year allograft survivals were 70%, 60%, and 55%,
respectively (Fig. 3).
Patient Survivals Stratified by Age at First OLT
The patients presented in the UNOS/OPTN dataset had a
bimodal age distribution. Of the 110 study patients, 25
patients (23%) were under age 4 (infantile HEH). Only
seven patients (6%) were transplanted between the ages of
4 and 18 (pediatric HEH), and 78 patients (71%) were over
age 18 (adult HEH). After OLT, patients with infantile
HEH experienced 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survivals of
68%, 61%, and 61%, respectively. Patients with adult
HEH experienced similar outcomes with 1-year, 3-year,
and 5-year survivals of 81%, 72%, and 67%, respectively
(p=0.75) (Fig. 4, Table 2).
Analysis of Prognostic Factors
Univariate analysis was used to determine the impact of study
variables on patient survivals. These comparisons determined
that Status 1 designation, gender, age, and era of transplantation did not influence patient survivals. In contrast, other
measures of pretransplant global medical condition, including
the need for inpatient hospitalization and the need for
intensive care unit management significantly impacted posttransplant survivals. Patients requiring hospitalization experience a 5-year posttransplant survival rate of only 44%,
whereas outpatients experienced a 72% 5-year survival rate
(p=0.01). Likewise, pretransplant intensive care unit patients
had 5-year survivals of only 39%, compared to 65% for nonintensive care unit patients (p=0.02).
Discussion
Hepatic HEH is a rare tumor of vascular origin with
variable malignant potential. No definitive etiologic factors
have been confirmed, but possible causes include vinyl
chloride, oral contraceptive use, asbestos, Thorotrast contrast, and alcoholic and viral hepatitis. Studies have
consistently found that HEH occurs more frequently in
women.1,10 In one clinicopathologic study of 137 HEH
cases, 61% of the patients were female and the mean age
was 47 years.10 The predominance of HEH in females,
particularly during the reproductive years, suggests a
hormonal association.10
Most patients present after the tumor burden becomes
large enough to cause symptoms. In a recent series of 137
HEH patients, the diagnosis was made incidentally in only
22% of cases.10 When symptomatic, the clinical presentation of HEH is nonspecific and includes right upper
quadrant pain, hepatomegaly, and weight loss.10 Tumor
markers (AFP, CEA, CA 19-9) are usually in the normal
range.1 Computed tomography (CT) findings indicative of
HEH include multiple hypo-attenuating tumors in both
hepatic lobes that coalesce in a peripheral or subcapsular
distribution with focal hepatic capsular retraction and, in
larger lesions, a halo or target pattern of enhancement.11,12

A definitive diagnosis of HEH requires histopathologic
assessment. Histologic characteristics include a well-developed
basal lamina, the presence of Weibel–Palade bodies, and
vascular invasion.10,13 As histologic features of HEH may be
similar to those of sclerosing hemangioma, angiosarcoma,
cholangiocarcinoma, and metastatic carcinoma, the specificity
of immunohistochemical examination is needed to supplement
histologic examination.10,13 Endothelial origin is confirmed by
positive immuno-staining for factor VIII-related antigen and
other endothelial cell markers.13 Although helpful for diagnosis, no histopathologic features have been correlated with the
disease’s clinical behavior.
Currently, no prognostic clinical or histopathologic
features have been identified that predict tumor aggressiveness. The only natural history data available for this disease
comes from reports of untreated patients. In their review of
the HEH world literature, Merhabi, et al.1 determined that
25% of reported cases of HEH went untreated. More than
half of these patients died of progressive disease and the 5-
year survival for this cohort was only 5%. The unpredictable clinical course of HEH is further highlighted by
specific reports of clinical outcomes after no treatment,
including reports of extended survival with spontaneous
tumor regression,10,14 versus reports of rapid tumor progression leading to fulminant hepatic failure.1,15
For the rare patient who presents with limited intrahepatic disease, local treatment including liver resection is a
logical treatment choice. Support for this approach comes
from a recent review of all published series on HEH, which
determined that the 5-year survival rate after resection for
HEH was 75%.1 However, because of the frequent
multifocal nature of HEH at presentation, liver resection is
rarely performed. In the above-mentioned review, only 19%
of patients presented with unilobar disease, only 13% of
patients presented with unifocal disease, and therefore, only
9.4% of these patients were candidates for liver resection.

In the setting of more diffuse intrahepatic disease, major
hepatic resection and OLT are the currently available
treatment modalities.2 Reports of tumor recurrence after
liver resection are inconsistent. Whereas one case report has
described success with major hepatic resection,16 aggressive recurrence after resection of apparently localized
lesions has also been reported.2 It has been suggested that
hepatotrophic, regenerative cellular signaling after hepatic
resection may lead to rapid hyperproliferation of residual
malignant disease in some patients.2
Instances of agressive disease recurrence and even
fulminant hepatic failure have been reported following
radical resection of multifocal HEH. In one recent study,
radical resection of multifocal HEH was followed by
multiple local recurrences, consumptive coagulopathy with
thrombocytopenia, and death after resection.3 Reports in the
literature of “salvage” OLT, after noncurative resection,
have also been disappointing.2
Based on the inability to predict the aggressiveness of
HEH, the limited applicability of liver resection, and the
reports of poor outcomes after resection of multifocal HEH,
wider implementation of OLT should be considered. In the
previously mentioned review of the world literature, 44.8%
of patients were treated with OLT.1 The 1-year and 5-year
survivals in this cohort were 96% and 54%, respectively.
Outcomes from the largest single-center cohort of patients
transplanted for HEH were reported by Madariaga, et al.
in 1995.7 Five-year patient survival in this cohort of 16
patients was 71.3%. Five-year survival rates from other
series in the literature include: Yokoyama et al.,8 48% (n=
8) and Penn et al.,17 43% (n=21). In our analysis of the
UNOS experience assessing 110 patients undergoing
transplantation for HEH between 1987 and 2005, 1-year
and 5-year allograft survivals were 70% and 55%,
respectively, and 1-year and 5-year overall patient survivals were 80% and 64%, respectively.
Reported all-stage 5-year patient survival rates for HEH,
regardless of therapy, are 41%,1 43%,10 and 56%.15 Given
that the majority of patients who undergo OLT have
advanced-stage disease with large tumor burden, achievement of 5-year patient survivals over 60% is remarkable. In
addition, these outcomes compare favorably to those after
OLT for other hepatic malignancies. Penn17 reported that
the HEH recurrence rate after OLT was only 33%,
compared to 39% for non-incidental hepatoma, 44% for
cholangiocarcinoma, 59% for metastatic tumors, and 64%
for hemangiosarcoma. In our review of the UNOS database,
38 patients died during follow-up, with only 12 patients
(11% of transplanted patients) having recurrent HEH as the
primary cause of death.
The favorable outcomes after OLT in patients with HEH
appear to be independent of patient age. Approximately
20% of the patients analyzed in this study were less than
4 years old. After OLT, this group with infantile HEH
experienced survivals (5-year OS: 61%) similar to those of
pediatric (5-year OS: 57%) and adult HEH patients (5-year
OS: 67%). Although patient age did not have prognostic
value, the analysis determined that the patient’s medical
condition before OLT was predictive of survival. Patients
who were hospitalized, either in an ICU or non-ICU setting
experienced significantly lower 5-year survival rates. These
findings warrant consideration regarding patient selection
for OLT listing and for donor-recipient matching.
Conclusions
This analysis indicates that liver transplantation for HEH
is associated with favorable outcomes. Although liver
resection and other local therapies may be reasonable
choices in cases of small, focal lesions, the frequent
presentation with multifocal disease often precludes the
use of these treatments. Given the favorable outcomes
after transplantation and the propensity for recurrence
after liver resection, liver transplantation should be
considered as a first-line treatment in patients who would
otherwise require major hepatic resection, including
selected patients with extrahepatic disease.
