Abstract
Aims/hypothesis Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
encompasses a spectrum ranging from simple steatosis to
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH): NAFLD causes an
increased risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and liverrelated complications (the latter confined to NASH). The effect
of proposed treatments on liver disease, glucose metabolism
and cardiovascular risk in NAFLD is unknown. We reviewed
the evidence for the management of liver disease and cardiometabolic risk in NAFLD.
Methods Publications through November 2011 were systematically reviewed by two authors. Outcomes evaluated though
standard methods were: histological/radiological/biochemical
features of NAFLD, variables of glucose metabolism and
cardiovascular risk factors. Seventy-eight randomised trials
were included (38 in NASH, 40 in NAFLD): 41% assessed
post-treatment histology, 71% assessed glucose metabolism
and 88% assessed cardiovascular risk factors. Lifestyle intervention, thiazolidinediones, metformin and antioxidants were
most extensively evaluated.
Results Lifestyle-induced weight loss was safe and improved
cardio-metabolic risk profile; a weight loss ≥7% improved
histological disease activity, but was achieved by <50%
patients. Statins and polyunsaturated fatty acids improved
steatosis, but their effects on liver histology are unknown.
Thiazolidinediones improved histological disease activity,
glucose, lipid and inflammatory variables and delayed fibrosis
progression. Pioglitazone also improved blood pressure.
Weight gain (up to 4.8%) was common. Antioxidants yielded
mixed histological results: vitamin E improved histological
disease activity when administered for 2 years, but increased
insulin resistance and plasma triacylglycerols.
Conclusions/interpretation Weight loss is safe, and improves
liver histology and cardio-metabolic profile. For patients not
responding to lifestyle intervention, pioglitazone improves
histological disease activity, slows fibrosis progression and
extensively ameliorates cardio-metabolic endpoints. Further
randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adequate size and
duration will assess long-term safety and efficacy of proposed
treatments on clinical outcomes.

Introduction
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects 30% of the
general adult population and 60–80% of diabetic and obese
patients [1, 2]. NAFLD encompasses a histological spectrum
ranging from simple steatosis (SS) to steatosis plus necroinflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH), with or
without fibrosis, that can only be differentiated by liver biopsy.
NAFLD carries an increased risk of (1) liver-related complications: whereas SS is considered to have a benign hepatological
prognosis, NASH progresses to cirrhosis in 20–25% of cases
over 10 years [1]; (2) cardio-metabolic complications: NAFLD
confers an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and
diabetes [3] both directly and through its association with other
cardio-metabolic abnormalities, including obesity and
metabolic syndrome [4]. Therefore, the impact of proposed
treatments on cardio-metabolic profile, as well as on liver
disease, should be evaluated. We systematically reviewed
the effect of current non-surgical treatments on liver disease
and cardio-metabolic risk in NAFLD.
Methods
Data sources and study selection
A detailed description of data sources and searches, and of
study selection, is reported in the electronic supplementary
material (ESM).
Outcome measures
Liver disease Primary outcome measures were incident cirrhosis/liver failure/hepatocellular carcinoma and improvement in
hepatic histological features (steatosis, hepatocellular
ballooning, lobular inflammation, fibrosis and, when
separate histological features were unavailable, NAFLD
activity score, NAS, which is the sum of steatosis,
hepatocellular ballooning and lobular inflammation);
wherever possible, the impact on fibrosis progression
(i.e. the number of patients with unchanged or improved
fibrosis stage) was also assessed. When these outcomes
were unavailable, changes in radiological steatosis (by
ultrasonography, nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR] magnetic
resonance spectroscopy [MRS] or computed tomography
[CT]), and in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were
evaluated.
Glucose metabolism We evaluated incident diabetes, fasting
plasma glucose (FPG), glucose tolerance (as assessed by a
standard OGTT), HbA1c, HOMA index and other variables
related to insulin sensitivity (hepatic and extrahepatic) and
insulin secretion, BMI and abdominal obesity (assessed by
anthropometry or by NMR/CT).
Cardiovascular risk We evaluated incident cardiovascular
events, BP, plasma lipids (triacylglycerol, LDL- and HDLcholesterol) and inflammatory markers/cytokines, including
C-reactive protein (CRP), adiponectin, interleukin-6 and
TNF-α.
Incident adverse events were also evaluated.
The quality of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was
assessed by the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (score
range: 0–8) [5]. RCTs scoring >6 were arbitrarily considered
as having a low bias risk.
Results
The agreement for study selection between the two
reviewers was good (κ coefficient00.86). We retrieved 78
RCTs (47 with a low risk of bias), variably reporting posttreatment changes in liver-related, glucose and cardiovascular variables (Table 1; ESM Fig. 1; ESM Tables 1-5).
Weight loss
Eight RCTs (373 participants, 39% diabetic; six RCTs with
a low risk of bias, four RCTs with post-treatment histology)
assessed the effect of lifestyle- or drug-induced weight loss
in NAFLD [6–13] (ESM Table 1).
Liver disease Although a ≥5% weight loss improved hepatic
steatosis, a ≥7% weight loss also improved NAS (Fig. 1);
fibrosis was unchanged (not shown). The threshold of 7%
weight loss was achieved by <50% of patients, even with
intensive multidisciplinary lifestyle intervention [8, 10]. Two
886 Diabetologia (2012) 55:885–904

RCTs suggested no additional NAS improvement with >10%
weight loss, but the existence of a lower and an upper threshold weight loss for improving histological disease activity
needs further confirmation (Fig. 2).
There was no significant publication bias (ESM Fig. 2).
Glucose metabolism and cardiovascular risk Weight loss
substantially improved HOMA, FPG, glucose tolerance
and plasma lipids (ESM Table 1). Two RCTs also showed
an improvement in plasma adiponectin [8, 12]. Among
drugs inducing weight loss, orlistat was safe, well-tolerated
with minor adverse gastrointestinal complaints not requiring
discontinuation of therapy, but conferred no additional
cardio-metabolic or histological benefit over lifestyle intervention alone [7, 12]. There was no significant publication
bias for assessed outcomes (not reported).

Long-term durability of achieved benefits and safety of
weight loss are unknown.
Physical exercise alone
Reduced aerobic exercise has been linked to the presence
and severity of cardio-metabolic and liver disease in
NAFLD through several potential mechanisms: reduced
hepatic and muscle adenosine monophosphate-activated
protein kinase (AMPK)-mediated NEFA oxidation, increased
postprandial hepatic lipogenesis, visceral fat-derived NEFA
and proinflammatory adipokine overflow to the liver [14–17].
Five RCTs (four RCTs with a low risk of bias) evaluated
the effects of 3–6 months of moderate-intensity aerobic
exercise alone in NAFLD [13, 18–21] (ESM Table 1).
Liver disease Exercise improved MRS-assessed steatosis
and ALT levels (Fig. 3). In the only RCT with posttreatment histology, NAS was unchanged [13]. There was
no significant publication bias (ESM Fig. 2)
Glucose metabolism and cardiovascular risk Despite no
significant body weight changes, exercise improved waist
circumference, HOMA, FPG, HbA1c, LDL-cholesterol and
triacylglycerol (TG) (Fig. 3). One RCT reported no
effect of physical exercise on HDL-cholesterol [20].
No data on inflammatory markers/adipokines are available.
There was no significant publication bias for assessed
outcomes (not reported).
An analysis of the reasons for dropping out of exercisebased treatments found that NAFLD patients understand the
benefits of exercise but lack confidence to perform it, and
are afraid of falling, suggesting that these modifiable factors
should be targeted to improve compliance to exercise of
these patients [22].
Dietary composition manipulation
The optimal nutrient dietary composition for NAFLD is
unknown. Three RCTs compared the effect of lowcarbohydrate versus low-fat caloric restriction [23–25]
(ESM Table 1).
Liver disease The two regimens yielded similar liver fat and
ALT reduction (Fig. 4).
Glucose metabolism and cardiovascular risk The two
regimens yielded similar weight loss and improved HOMA,
pancreatic beta cell function [24], TG, blood pressure [25],
CRP [24] and adiponectin to a similar extent (Fig. 4). For
TG and HOMA heterogeneity was high, being explained
by the different baseline features of study populations:
low-carbohydrate diet significantly improved plasma TG
and HOMA index when hypertriacylglycerolaemic [25]
or glucose-intolerant [23] NAFLD patients, respectively,
were enrolled. Furthermore, in glucose-intolerant NAFLD
individuals, low-carbohydrate caloric restriction significantly
improved hepatic insulin sensitivity compared with low-fat
diet [23].
Low-carbohydrate diet significantly reduced waist circumference and FPG compared with low-fat diet, which in

turn improved LDL-C and HDL-C more consistently than
the low-carbohydrate diet (Fig. 4).
These studies suggest that caloric restriction is the most
important goal for improving hepatic steatosis, but a different
nutrient composition may carry additional benefits according
to individual patient features.
Insulin-sensitisers: thiazolidinediones
Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) were evaluated in 11 RCTs (862
participants, 38% diabetic; seven RCTs with low risk of
bias) [26–37] (ESM Table 2).
Liver disease Pooled results of seven RCTs with posttreatment histology showed that TZDs improved steatosis,
hepatocellular ballooning and inflammation but not fibrosis;
however, when considering patients with improved or stable
fibrosis stage versus those with worsening fibrosis stage,
TZDs significantly reduced the risk of fibrosis progression
(Fig. 5). Heterogeneity was low for all assessed outcomes,
suggesting a consistent drug effect size across studies. There
was no significant publication bias (ESM Fig. 2)
Presence/absence of diabetes, the implementation of lifestyle intervention, different drug, dose or trial duration and
risk of bias did not affect outcomes.
Glucose metabolism and cardiovascular risk TZDs improved
HOMA, FPG, HbA1c, HDL-C, TG, CRP and adiponectin,
but had no effect on LDL-C and BP (Fig. 5). TZDs
improved also hepatic, muscle and adipose tissue insulin
resistance [26, 34, 37]. There was no significant publication
bias for assessed outcomes (not reported).

For some outcomes heterogeneity was high: for LDL-C,
heterogeneity was abated after excluding one RCT [30],
showing unexpected LDL-C increase with rosiglitazone
(weighed mean difference [WMD] 1.13, 95% CI −2.40,
4.66, p00.53, I2
034%, n comparisons05). For HOMA,
heterogeneity was abated after excluding one RCT [29],
showing unexpected HOMA increase with pioglitazone
(WMD −33%, 95% CI −44%, −22%, p00.00001, I2
040%,
n comparisons07).
For BP, after excluding the only RCT using rosiglitazone [34], the remaining trials showed no change in
systolic BP (WMD −1.5%, 95% CI −4.4%, −1.2%, p00.27,
I
2
012%, n comparisons03) or a reduction in diastolic BP
(WMD −3.3%, 95% CI −5.5%, −1.0%, p00.005, I2
00%,
n comparisons03) with pioglitazone.
For adiponectin, heterogeneity was abated after excluding
two RCTs using a lower dose of pioglitazone [29] or did not
vigorously implement lifestyle intervention [30] (WMD 118%,
95% CI 82, 155, p00.00001, I
2
00%, n comparisons03).
Weight gain (mean 2%, range 0–4.8%) occurred in up to
75% of patients, accompanied by an increased in waist
circumference, and was a common cause of dropout, together

with ankle oedema (4–25%). Weight gain did not reverse
with treatment discontinuation and was not prevented by
lifestyle intervention, but was reduced by metformin
coadministration [33, 38]. Besides limiting weight gain,
the combination of rosiglitazone+metformin offered no
significant histological or cardio-metabolic benefit over
rosiglitazone alone [33, 38].
NASH and associated cardio-metabolic abnormalities
relapsed 1 year after discontinuing TZDs [38], posing
the issue of the required treatment duration and of the
benefit/safety of sustained thiazolidinedione treatment.
In the Pioglitazone Versus Vitamin E versus Placebo for the
Treatment of Nondiabetic Patients with NASH (PIVENS) and
the Fatty Liver Improvement with Rosiglitazone Therapy
(FLIRT)-2 trial, liver histology did not improve further despite
continued HOMA and transaminase improvement over 2 and
3 years, respectively [32, 39]. These two trials suggest that
prolonged treatment with TZDs may offer no additional histological benefit and that metabolic improvement does not
necessarily parallel histological improvement.
Due to the short trial duration, no cases of congestive
heart failure, bone fractures or CVD events were reported.
Concern about cardiovascular safety led the European Medicines Agency to recommend withdrawal of rosiglitazone
from clinical use.
Insulin-sensitisers: metformin
Metformin has anorexigenic and weight-loss properties,
decreases gastrointestinal glucose absorption and increases
insulin sensitivity by increasing glucose uptake and AMPkinase-mediated oxidative glucose and lipid metabolism [40].
Eleven RCTs (671 participants, 27% diabetic; six RCTs in
NASH with post-treatment histology, three with a low bias
risk) evaluated metformin [33, 34, 41–49] (ESM Table 2).
Liver disease Metformin did not improve liver histology
compared with placebo (Fig. 6). Dose, treatment duration
(ranging from 6 to 24 months) or diabetic state had no effect
on post-treatment histology. There was no significant
publication bias (ESM Fig. 2)

Glucose metabolism and cardiovascular risk Metformin
significantly reduced body weight, waist circumference,
HOMA, FPG, and HbA1c, and increased HDL-C and
adiponectin, but had no effect on LDL-C, TG, blood
pressure [50] and CRP (Fig. 2). There was no significant
publication bias for assessed outcomes (not reported).
Heterogeneity of results for HOMA was abated after
excluding trials not effectively implementing lifestyle
intervention (as suggested by absence of weight loss in
the controls) [43, 46, 49] (WMD −21%, 95% CI −31, −11,
p00.0001, I
2
040%, n comparisons07), suggesting that the
insulin-sensitising effects of metformin are potentiated when
lifestyle intervention is effectively implemented.
Metformin was safe and well-tolerated: gastrointestinal
intolerance was the most common adverse effect, not requiring treatment discontinuation.
Lipid-lowering drugs
Statins The hepatological safety of statins in NAFLD has
been recently recognised and their feared potential for
worsening glucose tolerance seems largely outweighed
by their cardiovascular benefit [50, 51].
Four RCTs (719 participants, three with a low bias risk)
assessed statins in NAFLD [52–55] (ESM Table 3).
Liver disease Statins improved ALT (ESM Fig. 3) and
radiological steatosis [53, 54] in hyperlipidaemic NAFLD
patients; in the only RCT with post-treatment histology,
simvastatin had no effect on liver histology [56]. There
was no significant publication bias (ESM Fig. 2)
Glucose metabolism and cardiovascular risk Statins improve
LDL-C, HDL-C and TG without affecting body weight
(ESM Fig. 3). One RCT found no effect of statins on
waist circumference, BP, FPG and CRP [53]. There was
no significant publication bias for assessed outcomes
(not reported).
In a post hoc analysis of the Greek Atorvastatin and
Coronary Heart Disease Evaluation (GREACE) RCT,
stain-treated hyperlipidaemic NAFLD patients experienced
a significant (−68%) risk reduction of CVD events
compared with both presumed NAFLD patients not on
statin and with statin-treated patients with normal transaminases, without significant adverse events, including new-onset
diabetes [55]. Importantly, this study demonstrates that statins
are safe in NAFLD and that statin-related cardiovascular
benefit is greater in patients with NAFLD than in those with
normal liver tests.
Ezetimibe Growing evidence connects non-esterified cholesterol accumulation in mitochondria to hepatocyte apoptosis,
liver injury and NASH development [56–61]. On this basis,
ezetimibe, a Niemann-Pick C1 like 1 protein inhibitor, was
evaluated in two RCTs in NAFLD.
Liver disease Ezetimibe reduced histological ballooning
and fibrosis in one RCT, and MR-assessed liver fat in the
other [62, 63] (ESM Table 3).
Glucose metabolism and cardiovascular risk Ezetimibe
improved LDL-C and CRP, without affecting weight, waist
and HOMA. In one RCT, ezetimibe treatment was associated
with significant HbA1c increase compared with placebo [64].
n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids Five RCTs (303 participants, two RCTs with low risk of bias) evaluated polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) [64–68] (ESM Table 3).
Liver disease PUFA improved ALT (ESM Fig. 4) and
steatosis by NMR or ultrasound [65–68]. In the only RCT
with post-treatment histology, PUFA ameliorated steatosis
without affecting other histological features [68]. There was
no significant publication bias (ESM Fig. 2).
Glucose metabolism and cardiovascular risk PUFA ameliorated HOMA, HDL-C and TG, but had no effect on body
weight, BP and LDL-C (ESM Fig. 4). One RCT found no
effect of PUFA on waist circumference and CRP [68]. There
was no significant publication bias for assessed outcomes
(not reported).
Overall, PUFA were well-tolerated, with minor gastrointestinal symptoms.
Probucol Probucol, a lipophilic lipid-lowering agent with
strong antioxidant activity, was evaluated in NASH in one
RCT: ALT improved, but post-treatment histology was
unavailable [69] (ESM Table 3). Although generally
well-tolerated, probucol was associated with a significant fall
in HDL-C.
Fibrates Following consistent anti-steatogenic activity in
animal models of NAFLD [70], fibrates were evaluated in
five RCTs (315 participants, four RCTs with a low risk of
bias) [53, 71–74] (ESM Table 3).
Liver disease Fibrates had no effect on ALT (ESM Fig. 5),
radiological steatosis [75] or liver histology [73]. There was
no significant publication bias (ESM Fig. 2).
Glucose metabolism and cardiovascular risk Fibrates
improved HDL-C and TG, had no effect on body weight,
waist, HOMA, FPG and LDL-C (ESM Fig. 5). One RCT
showed no effect of fibrates on BP and adiponectin [53].
There was no significant publication bias for assessed
outcomes (not reported).

Angiotensin receptor blockers
The modulation of insulin sensitivity, systemic inflammation,
hepatic lipogenesis and fibrogenesis by the renin-angiotensin
system and the frequent coexistence of hypertension prompted
evaluation of angiotensin receptor blockers in NAFLD.
In a well-designed RCT on hypertensive NASH, telmisartan (an angiotensin receptor blocker with peroxisome
proliferator activated receptor [PPAR]-γ-regulating activity)
improved steatosis, necroinflammation, fibrosis, HOMA,
TG and total cholesterol more consistently than valsartan, despite similar BP reduction, suggesting that the
peculiar PPAR-γ-agonist activity may mediate the more
consistent metabolic and histological benefits of telmisartan
[75] (ESM Table 4).
In another RCT on hypertensive NAFLD patients, losartan
plus simvastatin significantly improved ultrasonographic
steatosis, visceral adiposity, HOMA and CRP compared
with amlodipine plus simvastatin, despite similar BP
reduction [76] (ESM Table 4).
Endocannabinoid receptor antagonists
The cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1) receptor antagonist
rimonabant experimentally antagonised appetite, caloric
intake, hepatic lipogenesis and fibrogenesis and was
evaluated in abdominally obese, dyslipidaemic NAFLD
patients from the ADAGIO-Lipids trial [77]: rimonabant
reversed CT-assessed steatosis in 48% of patients versus
19% on placebo (p00.03) and extensively improved all
cardio-metabolic variables (ESM Table 4). Depressive and
anxiety disorders were more common with rimonabant
(≅2.0% vs 1% with placebo). Concern about psychiatric
adverse effects led to withdrawal of rimonabant, but the
development of peripherally acting CB1 antagonists is an area
of intense research.
Anti-TNF-α agents (pentoxifylline)
The anti-TNF-α agent pentoxifylline has been evaluated in
four RCTs in NASH [78–81] (three with low risk of bias,
two assessing post-treatment histology) (ESM Table 4).
Liver disease Pooled data analysis showed that pentoxifylline improved histological steatosis and lobular inflammation (ESM Fig. 6). There was no significant publication bias
(ESM Fig. 2).
Glucose metabolism and cardiovascular risk Pentoxifylline
had no effect on body weight and HOMA (ESM Fig. 6).
One RCT found no impact on plasma LDL-C, HDL-C and
TG [80]. There was no significant publication bias for
assessed outcomes (not reported).
Overall, pentoxifylline was safe and well-tolerated with
minor gastrointestinal symptoms.
Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)
Seven RCTs (639 participants, 21% diabetic; three RCTs
with post-treatment histology, five RCTs with a low risk of
bias) evaluated UDCA in NAFLD (ESM Table 5) [82–88].
Liver disease Overall, UDCA improved ALT but not liver
histology (Fig. 7). For ALT and for lobular inflammation,
heterogeneity was high and was abated when considering
RCT evaluating high-dose (twofold higher than the conventional dose) UDCA or UDCA+vitamin E, showing a modest
benefit: for ALT WMD −20 IU/l, 95% CI −37, −3, p00.02,
I
2
040%, n comparisons03; for lobular inflammation OR 2.3;
95% CI 1.1, 5.0; p00.03, I
2
00%, n comparisons02). There
was no significant publication bias (ESM Fig. 2).
Glucose metabolism and cardiovascular risk UDCA
improved adiponectin (Fig. 7). For HOMA and FPG heterogeneity was abated after excluding one RCT evaluating the
combination of UDCA+vitamin E, the latter potentially
worsening HOMA (see below), showing a consistent benefit
with UDCA on both HOMA and FPG (for FPG: WMD −6%,
95% CI −9, −2, p00.0005, I

040%, n comparisons03).
One RCT reported significant improvement in HbA1c and
HDL-C with high-dose UDCA [85]. There was no significant publication bias for assessed outcomes (not reported).
Minor gastrointestinal effects occurred in >40% of
patients on high-dose UDCA.
Semi-synthetic bile acids
Besides their role in nutrient absorption, bile acids are
signalling molecules that exert genomic and non-genomic
effects by activating TGR5 and farnesoid X receptor
(FXR).
TGR5 is a G-protein-coupled receptor (expressed in
brown adipose tissue muscle and gut), activation of which
by bile acids increases energy expenditure and glucagonlike peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion and attenuates diet-induced
obesity [89, 90].
FXR is a nuclear hormone receptor expressed in the liver,
intestine and kidney. In the liver, FXR controls lipogenesis,
very-LDL metabolism, gluconeogenesis, glycogen synthesis
and insulin sensitivity, and also has also anti-inflammatory
and anti-fibrotic properties [90].
On this basis, a novel class of semi-synthetic bile acid
agonists of TGR5/FXR is being evaluated for the treatment
of obesity-related disorders, including NAFLD.
In the first RCT, Int-747, a semi-synthetic derivative of
the human bile acid CDCA, administered for 6 weeks to
Diabetologia (2012) 55:885–904 895

diabetic NAFLD patients, was well-tolerated, ameliorated
markers of liver fibrosis, insulin resistance and induced
weight loss compared with placebo (ESM Table 4) [91].
The ongoing FXR Ligand NASH Treatment (FLINT) double blind, placebo controlled, multicentre trial is evaluating
the effects of obeticholic acid in NASH.
Antioxidants
Fifteen RCTs (1,141 participants, 9% diabetic, seven RCTs
with low risk of bias) evaluated antioxidants in NAFLD:
overall, heterogeneity in study population, duration, type and
dose of drug, lifestyle intervention implementation, was considerable [6, 32, 49, 92–99] (ESM Table 5).
Liver disease Pooled results of the seven RCTs (685
patients, 4% diabetic) with post-treatment histology
showed no histological improvement and high heterogeneity (Fig. 8). Heterogeneity was reduced when considering
only the five RCTs with vitamin E, showing modest
improvement in steatosis (OR 1.83; 95% CI 1.03, 3.25;
I

035%, p00.04) and lobular inflammation (OR 1.57;
95% CI 1.03, 2.39; I
2
00%, p00.04). One RCT reported
also an improvement in NAS score with Viusid [98].

Antioxidants as a group or vitamin E did not slow
fibrosis progression (Fig. 8).
Predictors of histological response to antioxidants are
unclear: weight loss, circulating oxidative stress markers
or vitamin E deficiency do not predict histological response
[49, 95, 96, 100]. There was no significant publication bias
(ESM Fig. 1)
Glucose metabolism and cardiovascular risk Antioxidants
had no effect on body weight, waist circumference, LDL-C
and HDL-C. For HOMA, FPG and TG heterogeneity was
high (Fig. 8): when considering only the RCTs with vitamin
E, active treatment had no significant effect on FPG (WMD
−0.04, 95% CI −0.66, 0.57, p00.89, I

00%, n comparisons0
5), but was associated with a modestly higher risk of increasing HOMA (WMD 10.5, 95% CI 0.3, 20.6, p00.04, I2
045%,
n comparisons04) and plasma TG (WMD 6.00, 95% CI 1.26,
10.75, p00.01, I
2
00%, n comparisons04) compared with
controls. One RCT showed an improvement in plasma adiponectin with the combination of UDCA+vitamin E compared
with placebo [88]. There was no significant publication bias
for assessed outcomes (not reported).
Other drugs: L-carnitine, probiotics, incretin analogues,
caspase inhibitors
L-carnitine is a precursor of carnitine-palmitoyltransferase,
the rate-limiting enzyme in mitochondrial fatty acid transport and oxidation. When added to lifestyle intervention for
6 months, it improved steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis,
HOMA, FPG, plasma lipids and C-reactive protein (ESM
Table 5) [101].
Gut bacteria may promote liver injury and systemic inflammation through endotoxin-mediated toll-like receptor-4 axis
activation and other mechanisms, predisposing to NASH,
diabetes and atherosclerosis [102]. Three RCTs assessed probiotics in NAFLD: the first, evaluating VSL3, was prematurely terminated for an increase in hepatic steatosis [103]; the
others, assessing a mixture of Lactobacillus spp. plus either
Bifidobacterium bifidum or Streptococcus thermophilus,
found a significant improvement in MRS-assessed hepatic
fat and aminotransferases, respectively [104, 105].
The effect of probiotics in NAFLD is being evaluated in
clinical trials (trial registration clinicaltrials.gov NCT00099723,
NCT00808990, NCT00870012).
Incretin GLP-1 analogues improved insulin secretion by
stimulating pancreatic beta cell growth and insulin release,
and also improved hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in
mouse models [106]. Exenatide significantly improved transaminases in three RCTs enrolling diabetic patients [107], and
its effects on liver histology in NASH are being tested in
clinicaltrials.gov NCT00529204 and NCT00650546. In the
Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes (LEAD)-2 RCT,
2 years of liraglutide significantly reduced liver enzymes,
CT-assessed hepatic steatosis, body fat and blood pressure
and improved glycaemic control in diabetic patients with
NAFLD (ESM Table 5) [108].
In NASH, hepatocyte apoptosis correlates with disease
severity, and reducing hepatocyte apoptosis may has a
potential for altering the course of the liver disease. In a
phase 2 RCT, 124 patients with biopsy-proven NASH
were randomised to once-daily placebo or 1, 5, 10 or
40 mg of the selective caspase inhibitor GS-9450 for 4 weeks:
at EOT, NASH patients treated with 5–40 mg/day of GS-9450
significantly improved ALT levels, but not other metabolic
variables, without significant side effects [109].
Discussion
Implications for practice
Weight loss is safe and may benefit both liver and
cardio-metabolic disease in NAFLD: although a ≥5%
weight loss improves steatosis and cardio-metabolic variables,
a ≥7% weight loss improves also histological disease activity
in NASH; however, the latter goal was achieved by <50%
individuals even in RCTs adopting intensive multidisciplinary
lifestyle interventions, making patient compliance a concern
[8, 10].
Regular moderate-intensity aerobic exercise should be
implemented in lifestyle intervention, as it enhances
whole body lipid oxidation, and improves steatosis and
cardio-metabolic risk profile regardless of weight loss: it
may also protect NAFLD patients against the development of
diabetes [110].
For patients with NASH not responding to lifestyle
intervention, pharmacological treatment should be considered. Currently, no specific pharmacological treatment
can be recommended outside clinical trials, for long-term
safety and efficacy concerns. Among available agents,
TZDs, statins, PUFA and antioxidants have been most
extensively evaluated. Statins and PUFA ameliorate steatosis
and liver enzymes, but their impact on liver histology is
unknown,
TZDs improve steatosis and necroinflammation, slow
fibrosis progression, and ameliorate glucose and lipid
metabolism and subclinical inflammation, with more
consistent cardiovascular benefits with pioglitazone.
These findings should not be underestimated, given the
key role of fibrosis in the progression of NAFLD to
end-stage liver disease, and pioglitazone warrants evaluation
in a larger RCT of longer duration. Open issues on TZDs are
their long-term safety and efficacy, how to prevent their side
effects and the development of predictors of histological
response to these drugs.
Diabetologia (2012) 55:885–904 897

Antioxidants yielded mixed results on liver histology,
improving histological disease activity when administered
for 2 years or when implemented with vigorous weight-loss
regimens [97].
Differently from TZDs, vitamin E worsened insulin
resistance and plasma TG. Several studies found that
vitamins E may preclude the insulin-sensitising effects
of exercise by hampering physiological training-induced
cellular adaptations in muscle in healthy individuals:
vitamin E supplementation prevented exercise-induced
production of PPAR-γ, PPAR-γ coactivators PGC1α
and PGC1β, and antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase
and glutathione peroxidase [111]. Although these data have
not been recently confirmed [112, 113], the impact of
antioxidants on muscle insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant
individuals is unclear. An increased all-cause mortality has
been associated with long-term administration of doses of
vitamin E typically used in these trials [114]. Finally,
antioxidant effectiveness in diabetic NAFLD patients,
characterised by prominent systemic oxidative stress and
severe liver histology, is unknown, as only 9% of enrolled
patients were diabetic.
Implications for future research
With the exception of the GREACE trial [55] , no RCT had
adequate size and duration to evaluate clinical outcomes.
Therefore, future RCTs need to assess if the observed benefits
on intermediate endpoints will translate into a reduction of
liver-related and cardio-metabolic morbidity and mortality.
The optimal dietary nutrient composition for NAFLD is
an uncovered field: the role of excessive fructose, cholesterol
and trans fat for NAFLD pathogenesis, as suggested by
epidemiological and experimental studies, deserves evaluation in therapeutic RCTs. Fructose and high-fructose corn
syrup, a common soft drink sweetener, in particular, have
been independently connected to the risk and severity of
NAFLD in population-based studies and in a randomised
crossover trial [115–119].
The role of alcohol consumption in NAFLD needs also
further evaluation: retrospective data suggest a protective
role for light-to-moderate (<10–20 g/day) alcohol intake
against insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and NAFLD
[120, 121]. By contrast, modest alcohol intake and obesity
seem to have additive effect on liver disease progression,
and in a large prospective study any degree of alcohol
consumption increased by 3.6-fold the risk of hepatocellular
carcinoma in NASH-related cirrhosis [122, 123].
Cigarette smoking, an established risk factor for CVD
and metabolic syndrome, has been epidemiologically
linked to the onset and severity of NASH [124–126].
In the GREACE trial [54], current smokers had an OR
of having baseline abnormal liver enzymes of 3.03 (95%
CI 1.99, 4.64) compared with non-smokers. These data
prompt evaluation of the effects of smoking cessation on
NAFLD in future RCTs.
With the possible exceptions of telmisartan and pentoxifylline (limited evidence from two small RCTs), available agents
do not improve hepatic fibrosis, the features most consistently
associated with adverse liver-related outcomes. This may have
several explanations: the slower progression rate (0.1–0.2
stages per year) of fibrosis [127] may require larger and longer
RCTs to show fibrosis regression, and the encouraging results
of TZDs on fibrosis progression are consistent with this view;
alternatively, hepatic fibrogenesis may involve different
molecular mechanisms from those involved in dysmetabolism, steatosis and inflammation. Within this context, antifibrotic agents targeting directly hepatic stellate cell activation
and collagen deposition/remodelling, including toll-like
receptor-4, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs)
and FXR, are under development and phase III RCTs are
eagerly awaited [128].
Our analysis provides also some hints for methodological
improvement of future RCTs. Concerning cardio-metabolic
risk of NAFLD, it is currently unclear whether NAFLD
determines or is just a marker of associated cardio-metabolic
abnormalities, and a comprehensive cardio-metabolic profiling
of these patients may help predicting the impact of proposed
treatments on cardio-metabolic outcomes [129]. As an
example, HbA1c (reported in only 22% of RCTs; Table 1) is
emerging as a robust marker not only of recent glycaemic
control in diabetes, but also of the risk of developing diabetes
and CVD in diabetic and non-diabetic individuals [130, 131].
The risk of developing or deteriorating type 2 diabetes is
related to insulin resistance and pancreatic beta cell dysfunction [132]. In NAFLD, insulin resistance is universal,
but impaired pancreatic beta cell function was also found in
non-diabetic patients with NASH [133]. The different tissue
insulin sensitivity also needs attention. Most RCTs adopted
fasting insulin sensitivity indices (HOMA and QUICKI)
(Table 1), which are easy to measure, predict incident
CVD and diabetes in the general population and overall
mortality in NAFLD [134, 135], but may have some limitations in such a complex disease as NAFLD. Insulin sensitivity is tissue-specific and skeletal muscle (i.e. the ability of
insulin to enhance glucose disposal in muscle), hepatic (i.e.

the ability of insulin to suppress hepatic glucose output in
fasting conditions) and adipose tissue (i.e. the ability of
insulin to suppress adipose tissue lipolysis) insulin sensitivity do not always parallel each other and may
differently relate to liver and cardio-metabolic disease:
whereas liver injury seems tightly related to adipose
tissue insulin sensitivity in NASH [26], hepatic or muscle
insulin sensitivity are more tightly related to glucose tolerance
and the risk of future diabetes [136]. This may explain why
metformin does not affect liver histology despite constant
HOMA reduction and, similarly, the lack of improvement
in liver injury despite continued HOMA improvement
observed in the FLIRT trials. Therefore, different tissue
insulin sensitivity should be systematically assessed,
together with pancreatic beta cell function, with a simple
standard OGTT, without applying the more troublesome
glucose clamp technique [137].
Plasma inflammatory markers are also emerging as
important tools in risk assessment and targeting of therapy in
patients with metabolic syndrome and could be extended to
RCTs on NAFLD [138].
In conclusion, weight loss and pioglitazone seem to
most extensively benefit intermediate endpoints in
NAFLD, improving not only liver disease but also cardiometabolic variables [139], while vitamin E improves
histological disease activity but may worsen the cardiometabolic profile. The latter issue, as well as the risk/
benefit profile of other antioxidants in NAFLD [140],
needs further evaluation in future RCTs adequately powered
for clinical outcomes.
