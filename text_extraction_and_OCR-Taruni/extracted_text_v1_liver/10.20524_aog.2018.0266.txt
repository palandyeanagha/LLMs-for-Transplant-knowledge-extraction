Background The optimal management of HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc-positive patients who 
receive immunosuppression remains unclarified. We systematically reviewed the available data on 
potential predictors of the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in such patients.
Methods A literature search identified 55 studies with 3640 HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc-positive 
patients who received immunosuppressive regimens.
Results HBV reactivation was reported in 236  (6.5%) patients. The pooled HBV reactivation 
rates did not differ between patients with detectable or undetectable HBV DNA in studies with 
hematological diseases or regimens containing rituximab, but it was higher in patients with 
detectable than in those with undetectable HBV DNA who were taking rituximab-free regimens 
(14% vs. 2.6%; risk ratio [RR] 12.67, 95%CI: 95%CI 2.39-67.04, P=0.003) or had non-hematological 
diseases, although the latter was not confirmed by sensitivity analysis (RR 8.80, 95%CI 0.71-109.00, 
P=0.09). The pooled HBV reactivation rates were lower in patients with positive than in those 
with negative anti-HBs in studies with hematological (7.1% vs. 21.8%; RR 0.29, 95%CI 0.19-0.46, 
P<0.001) or non-hematological (2.5% vs. 10.7%; RR 0.28, 95%CI 0.11-0.76, P=0.012) diseases, 
and rituximab-containing (6.6% vs. 19.8%; RR 0.32, 95%CI 0.15-0.69, P=0.003) or rituximab-free 
(3.3% vs. 9.2%; RR 0.36, 95%CI 0.14-0.96, P=0.042) regimens.
Conclusions The risk of HBV reactivation is high; therefore, anti-HBV prophylaxis should be 
recommended in HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc-positive patients with hematological diseases and/or 
rituximab-containing regimens, regardless of HBV DNA and anti-HBs status. In contrast, patients 
with non-hematological diseases or rituximab-free regimens have a low risk of HBV reactivation and 
may not require anti-HBV prophylaxis if they have undetectable HBV DNA and positive anti-HBs.

Abstract

Annals of Gastroenterology 31

Introduction
Although HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc-positive patients 
have a lower risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation 
compared to HBsAg-positive patients, the prevalence of 
anti-HBc is higher than that of HBsAg, ranging from 5% 
in Western to >50% in Far Eastern countries [1-3]. Thus, 
there are numerically many cases of HBV exacerbations in 
HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc-positive patients who receive 
immunosuppressive regimens. Recommendations based 
mostly on expert opinion state that HBsAg-negative, antiHBc-positive patients with detectable HBV DNA should 
be managed similarly to HBsAg-positive patients, while 
those with undetectable HBV DNA should be followed 
carefully, with frequent aminotransferases and HBV 
DNA determinations, or should receive prophylaxis with 
lamivudine [3]. The type of immunosuppressive regimen 
seems to affect the probability of HBV reactivation in this 
setting. In particular, rituximab, an increasingly used antiCD20 chimeric monoclonal antibody, has been associated 
with severe HBV reactivations in HBsAg-negative, anti-HBcpositive patients [1].
Recently, the American Gastroenterological 
Association [4] strongly recommended antiviral prophylaxis 
in HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc-positive patients treated 
with B-cell-depleting agents (e.g.,  rituximab, ofatumumab) 
because they were considered to be at high risk (>10%) of 
HBV reactivation. In the same position paper, all the other 
HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc-positive patients were considered 
to be at moderate (1-10%) or low (<1%) risk for HBV 
reactivation [4]. The latter recommendations were considered 
as weak and based on evidence of moderate quality. In 
addition, the usefulness of baseline HBV DNA evaluation is 
not reported, while the document counseled against using 
anti-HBs to stratify the risk of HBV reactivation [4]. Since 
literature data are scarce and no strong recommendation has 
been made, the optimal management of such cases remains 
controversial.
We systematically evaluated the available data in order to 
assess the risk of HBV reactivation in HBsAg-negative, antiHBc-positive patients under immunosuppression in relation to 
their baseline HBV status (HBV DNA and anti-HBs), as well as 
the type of underlying primary disease (hematological vs. nonhematological) and immunosuppressive regimen (rituximabcontaining vs. rituximab-free).
Materials and methods
Data sources and searches
PubMed and Scopus from January 2006 to February 
2015 were searched to identify all medical literature 
included under the terms “hepatitis B” and “reactivation” or 
“immunosuppression” or “immunosuppressive therapy”. In 
addition, a manual search of all relevant review articles and of 
the retrieved original studies was performed.
Study selection
All studies published in English were included if they 
fulfilled all of the following criteria: 1) they were randomised 
trials or observational cohort studies; 2) they included adult 
patients with past HBV infection (i.e., HBsAg-negative, antiHBc-positive patients) who received immunosuppressive 
regimens; and 3) there were patients without pre-emptive 
prophylaxis with nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) against HBV 
reactivation and with available data on the incidence of HBV 
reactivation. Studies evaluating solid organ transplant antiHBc-positive recipients were excluded. In each selected study, 
only patients with a past HBV infection were evaluated, while 
HBsAg-positive patients were excluded. The only studies 
analyzed were those that included a comparative evaluation of 
differences in the risk for HBV reactivation between different 
groups of patients. The literature search was performed by one 
author (EC), who screened titles and abstracts and determined 
which studies could potentially be included. Each study in the 
list of the preselected papers was independently evaluated by 
two reviewers (EC, GP) to determine whether it fulfilled all the 
inclusion criteria.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Data extraction from the finally selected papers was 
carried out by two authors (EC, PC) according to a predefined 
form. Any queries regarding data extraction were arbitrated 
by discussion with another author (GP). Data extracted 
for selected studies included country and center(s), date of 
publication, type of study, sample size, age, sex, HBV status 
before initiation of immunosuppression regarding anti-HBs 
positivity and HBV DNA detectability, underlying primary 
disease (hematological or not), type of immunosuppressive 
regimen (rituximab or not), follow-up period, number of 
patients with HBV reactivation, administration of NAs after 
HBV reactivation, and final outcome. A pilot data extraction 
form was tested and revised. We categorized the included 
studies as randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective 
or retrospective cohort studies. The Cochrane Collaboration’s 
tool for assessing the risk of bias in RCTs [5] and the 
Newcastle Ottawa Scale [6] were used to assess the quality 
of the included randomized and nonrandomized studies, 
respectively.
Data synthesis and analysis
The outcome of interest involved HBV reactivation in two 
separate groups: patients with or without hematological disease 
and patients receiving rituximab-containing or rituximab-

free regimens. The pooled rate of HBV reactivation (pi) was 
estimated by the inverse variance method, transforming 
to logits using the equation lpi=log(pi/[1-pi]) with the 
corresponding variance being 1/(Ni×pi×[1-pi]), where pi 
represents the estimated probability from the study and Ni
represents the corresponding reference population at baseline. 
Pooled logit estimates and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) 
were back-transformed to probabilities by the inverse logit 
transformation pi=elpi/(elpi+1), where e is the base of the natural 
logarithm [7].
Meta-analysis aims to synthesize the outcomes of each 
included study into one weighted average to estimate the 
intervention effect, along with 95%CI to assess the statistical 
significance. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated for the predefined 
outcomes and studies were weighted against the natural 
logarithm of the variance of RR. Random-effects meta-analysis 
was chosen in advance as the analysis method, to incorporate 
the assumption that the true effect varies across studies. In 
cases of zero responders, zero was replaced by 0.5, and the 
number of participants was corrected accordingly. Funnel plots 
were produced to visually inspect for publication bias and were 
assessed using the modified Harbord’s test for outcomes when 
there were ≥10 studies available [8,9].
Heterogeneity was examined visually in the forest plots 
and its extent was estimated using the I2 measure, as proposed 
by Higgins et al [10], as low (I2=25-49%), moderate (I2=50-
74%) and high (I2≥75%). All analyses were performed using 
STATA, version  12.0. We considered P<0.05 (two-sided) as 
significant.
Results
In total, 1120 articles were initially identified from the literature 
search, but only 58 studies [11-68] fulfilled the inclusion criteria. 
Six studies, two from a single center in China [32,66], two from 
a single center in Japan [22,67] and two from Turkey [51,68], 
had overlapping study periods; in these cases, only the more 
recent study from each center was included [22,32,51]. Thus, 
55 studies with a total of 3640 HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc 
patients were included in our analysis [11-65]. Study and patient 
characteristics are presented in Table  1. There was only one 
RCT [34], 25 prospective [11,13,15,18-23,26,27,29,30,32,35,41,
42,47,55-57,60,63-65], 2 prospective/retrospective [17,37], and 
27 retrospective cohort studies [12,14,16,24,25,28,31,33,36,38
-40,43-46,48-54,58,59,61,62]. The RCT and 26 (48%) of the 54 
nonrandomized studies were of low quality.
HBV reactivation under immunosuppressive regimens
HBV reactivation was detected in 6.5% (236/3640) of 
HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc-positive patients who received 
immunosuppressive regimens during a median follow 
up of 24  months (range: 12-49). The definition of HBV 
reactivation was based on HBsAg reappearance and/or HBV 
DNA increase (with elevated levels of aminotransferases in 4 
studies [27,42,47,54]). The rates of HBV reactivation ranged from 
0-85.7% in 22 studies that defined reactivation as both HBsAg 
reappearance and HBV DNA increase [11-13,20,23,24,26,31-
33,36,37,40,42,44,46-48,51,54,56,63], from 0-19.6% in 12 
studies that defined reactivation as HBsAg reappearance 
alone [14,17,19,28,38,39,41,43,45,49,55,62], and from 0-17.9% 
in 16 studies that defined reactivation as an increase in HBV 
DNA alone [15,16,18,22,25,27,29,30,34,35,52,53,57,59,60,65]. 
No definition of HBV reactivation was provided in 5 studies 
that included 306 patients [21,50,58,61,64].
HBV reactivation occurred during immunosuppressive 
therapy in 58  patients (between 30 and 300  days after 
the initiation of immunosuppressive therapy) and after 
the cessation of immunosuppression in 48  patients 
(between 14 and 670  days after immunosuppression 
discontinuation) [12,15,16,28,32,37,40,44,45,48,53-56,59,64,65]. 
No data regarding the timing of HBV reactivation were 
provided for 130 patients.
HBV reactivation in patients with or without hematological 
diseases
The total pooled rate of HBV reactivation was significantly 
higher in patients with detectable than in those with 
undetectable serum baseline HBV DNA: 18.8% (95%CI 
11.8-28.7) vs. 5.7% (95%CI 3.2-9.8); RR 4.27  (95%CI 1.45-
12.56); P=0.008; I2=31.3%, P for heterogeneity=0.149 (Fig. 1). 
Evidence of bias was found in HBV DNA comparisons for 
HBV reactivation risk by visual inspection of funnel plots and 
by Harbord’s modified test (P=0.019).
The total pooled rate of HBV reactivation was also lower in 
patients with positive than in those with negative anti-HBs: 5.2% 
(95%CI 3.5-7.6) vs. 17.0% (95%CI 12.5-22.6); RR 0.29 (95%CI 
0.19-0.44), P<0.001; I2=0%, P for heterogeneity=0.993 (Fig. 2). 
Visual inspection of funnel plots and Harbord’s modified test 
found no evidence of bias in anti-HBs comparisons for HBV 
reactivation risk (P=0.212).
The pooled rate of HBV reactivation was 10.9% (95%CI 
7.8-14.9) in studies including patients with hematological and

3.6% (95%CI 2.2-5.7) in studies including patients with nonhematological diseases. Since no individual study included 
patients from both groups, no appropriate conclusion could 
be drawn regarding the RR for HBV reactivation in patients 
with hematological diseases compared to those with nonhematological diseases.
Comparing patients with detectable and undetectable
serum baseline HBV DNA, the pooled rate of HBV 
reactivation was significantly higher in studies with nonhematological diseases: 14.2% (95%CI 6.9-26.9) vs. 2.0% 
(95%CI 1.1-3.6); RR 20.59  (95%CI 3.34-126.94), P=0.001; 
I2=0%, P for heterogeneity=0.788 [18,20,29,32]. However, it 
was only numerically higher in studies with hematological 
diseases: 21.9% (95%CI 12.9-34.7) vs. 11.3% (95%CI 6.3-
19.5); RR 2.33  (95%CI 0.69-7.83), P=0.173; I2=30.5%, P 
for heterogeneity=0.195 [15,17,34,35,44,47,56] (Fig.  1, 
3). In order to explore the wide 95%CIs, we conducted a 
sensitivity analysis excluding studies with uncertainty in 
estimates. Patients with detectable rather than undetectable
baseline HBV DNA had a numerically higher risk for 
HBV exacerbation in studies with non-hematological 
diseases: RR 8.80  (95%CI 0.71-109.00), P=0.090 I2=0%, 
P for heterogeneity=0.965 [18,20]. However, there was 
no difference in studies with hematological patients: 
RR 0.96  (95%CI 0.32-2.89), P=0.938; I2=0%, P for 
heterogeneity=0.795 [15,34,35,44,56].
Likewise, the pooled rate of HBV reactivation was lower 
in patients with positive than in those with negative antiHBs in studies with hematological—7.1% (95%CI 4.4-11.2) 
vs. 21.8% (95%CI 15.3-30.1); RR 0.29  (95%CI 0.19-0.46), 
P<0.001, I2=0%, P for heterogeneity=0.862 [15-17,25,28,32,34-
36,39,41,44,47,51,55,61]—or non-hematological—2.5% 
(95%CI 1.5-4.6) vs. 10.7% (95%CI 5.7-19.0); RR 0.28 (95%CI 
0.11-0.76) P=0.012; I2=0%, P for heterogeneity=0.987 [13,18,1

I2=0%, P for heterogeneity=0.849 (Fig.  5). Both groups had 
numerically close mean durations of follow up (20±12  vs. 
22±10  months). The directions of the results were similar 
even when the rates of HBV reactivation were evaluated 
separately in prospective—RR 4.91  (95%CI 0.93-26.09), 
P=0.062 [35,47,63]—and retrospective—RR 1.49 (95%CI 0.74-

HBV reactivation developed after the cessation of 
immunosuppression in 26  (42%) of 62  patients receiving 
rituximab-containing regimens (range: 14-409  days) and

because of the lack of available data concerning the 
incidence of HBV reactivation in patients: a) receiving 
rituximab-containing regimens for hematological vs. nonhematological diseases; or b) receiving rituximab alone vs. 
rituximab in combination with other regimens, particularly 
steroids.
The pooled rate of HBV reactivation was significantly 
higher in patients with detectable than in those with 
undetectable baseline serum HBV DNA treated with 
rituximab-free regimens: 14.0% (95%CI 7.5-24.7) vs. 2.6% 
(95%CI 1.2-5.3); RR 12.67  (95%CI 2.39-67.04), P=0.003; 
I2=0%, P for heterogeneity=0.599 [18,20,29,32,34]. 
However, no such difference was seen in patients treated 
with rituximab-containing regimens: 11.7% (95%CI 6.5-
20.2) vs. 11.6% (95%CI 5.0-24.7); RR 1.00  (95%CI 0.25-
3.97), P=0.997; I2=0%, P for heterogeneity=0.412 [15,34,65] 
(Fig. 1).
In contrast to baseline HBV DNA status, anti-HBs 
seropositivity affected the risk of HBV reactivation regardless 
of rituximab therapy. In particular, the pooled rate of HBV 
reactivation was lower in patients with than in those without 
anti-HBs treated with rituximab-containing—6.6% (95%CI 2.9-
14.4) vs. 19.8% (95%CI 15.6-24.7); RR 0.32 (95%CI 0.15-0.69), 
P=0.003; I2=0%, P for heterogeneity=0.736 [15,25,28,32,34,35]—
or rituximab-free regimens—3.3% (95%CI 2.0-5.5) vs. 9.2% 
(95%CI 5.3-15.4); RR 0.36 (95%CI 0.14-0.96), P=0.042; I2=0%, 
P for heterogeneity=0.988 [12,17,18,24,22,25,29,32,34,49,51,57
,58,61] (Fig. 2).
Outcomes of patients with HBV reactivation
Data regarding outcomes were provided in 174  (73.8%) 
of 236  patients with HBV reactivation, while data regarding 
antiviral therapy after the onset of HBV reactivation were 
available for 148  (85%) of these 174  patients: 23 remained 
untreated and 125 were treated with NAs (entecavir: 56, 
lamivudine: 59, adefovir±lamivudine: 4, entecavir or 
lamivudine: 6) [12,15-17,21,23-25,27-41,44-48,51,54,65]. 
Twenty-two (14.9%) of the 148  patients died: 7/23  (30.4%) 
patients who remained untreated and 15/125  (12%) patients 
treated with NAs. Finally, 2 (3.5%) of 56 patients and 10 (17%) 
of 59  patients who received entecavir and lamivudine, 
respectively, for HBV reactivation died during the follow-up 
period [12,15-17,21,23-25,28-30,32-39,44,45,47,51,54].
Discussion
In this systematic review of more than 3600 HBsAgnegative, anti-HBc-positive patients who received 
immunosuppressive therapy we confirmed that patients 
treated with rituximab-containing regimens have a higher 
risk for HBV reactivation, compared to those receiving 
rituximab-free regimens: 9.7% vs. 4.1%; RR 1.80  (95%CI 
0.99-3.28). No relevant studies were identified and 
therefore no conclusions could be drawn concerning the 
new generations of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies 
(e.g.,  ofatumumab, veltuzumab), developed recently. The

Anti-HBc-positive patients and immunosuppression 9
pooled rates of HBV reactivation were 10.9% in patients 
with hematological diseases and 3.6% in patients with nonhematological diseases, but no direct statistical comparison 
could be drawn between these two groups because of 
limitations in the available data.
The detectability of baseline HBV DNA had no impact on 
the risk of HBV reactivation in patients at high risk due to 
the underlying disease or the immunosuppressive regimens. 
In particular, the pooled rates of HBV reactivation were 
similar in patients with detectable or undetectable HBV 
DNA treated with rituximab-containing regimens or having 
hematological diseases. In contrast, patients with detectable, 
compared to those with undetectable baseline HBV DNA 
had a higher risk for HBV reactivation if they were treated 
with rituximab-free regimens (14.0% vs. 2.6%; RR 12.67, 
P=0.003) or had non-hematological diseases (14.2% vs. 2%; 
RR 20.59, P=0.001), although the latter difference became 
insignificant in the sensitivity analysis (P=0.090). Practically, 
it could be suggested that in HBsAg-negative, anti-HBcpositive patients with non-hematological disease, or treated 
with rituximab-free regimens, HBV DNA evaluation is useful 
for stratification of the risk for HBV reactivation. However, 
in those who have hematological disease or are treated with 
rituximab-containing regimens, anti-HBV prophylaxis seems 
to be necessary in all cases, regardless of baseline HBV DNA 
status.
Although the current statement recommends against using 
anti-HBs status to guide antiviral prophylaxis [4], we found 
that positive compared to negative anti-HBs at baseline was 
associated with a significantly lower risk for HBV reactivation 
in all patient subgroups: those with hematological (7.1% 
vs. 21.8%, RR 0.29, 95%CI 0.19-0.46, P<0.001) or nonhematological diseases (2.5% vs. 10.7%, RR 0.28, 95%CI 
0.11-0.76, P=0.012), and under rituximab-containing (6.6% 
vs. 19.8%, RR 0.32, 95%CI 0.15-0.69, P=0.003) or rituximabfree (3.3% vs. 9.2%, RR 0.36, 95%CI 0.14-0.96, P=0.042) 
regimens. This analysis was based on baseline anti-HBs 
status and not on baseline anti-HBs levels or their possible 
reduction during immunosuppression therapy, given the 
very limited literature data available. Based on these findings, 
and taking into account the impact of baseline HBV DNA, it 
could be suggested that anti-HBV prophylaxis seems to be 
necessary, irrespectively of baseline HBV DNA or anti-HBs 
status, in patients who have hematological disease or are 
under rituximab-containing regimens. On the other hand, in 
patients with non-hematological diseases under rituximabfree regimens, antiviral prophylaxis should be recommended 
in those with detectable baseline HBV DNA, regardless of 
anti-HBs status, but is not required in those with undetectable
HBV DNA and positive anti-HBs. The decision for anti-HBV 
prophylaxis may be individualized in patients with nonhematological diseases under treatment with rituximab-free 
regimens and have undetectable HBV DNA and negative 
anti-HBs.
An interesting finding was that HBV reactivation 
developed in 26  (42%) of 62  patients receiving rituximabcontaining regimens between 14 and 409  days after 
the cessation of immunosuppression and in 6  (32%) of 
19  patients receiving rituximab-free regimens between 90 
and 300  days after the end of immunosuppression. Thus, 
clinicians should continue to follow these patients closely 
for long after the completion of immunosuppression/
chemotherapy, avoiding early discontinuation of possible 
anti-HBV prophylaxis.
The clinical presentation of HBV reactivation may vary 
from asymptomatic to acute liver failure and death [1]. Indeed, 
higher mortality has been reported in HBsAg-negative, antiHBc-positive compared to HBsAg-positive patients, perhaps 
related to underestimation of the risk for HBV reactivation and 
the delay in diagnosis [1]. Thus, early diagnosis and prompt 
treatment initiation are crucial for the effective management 
of such cases not under anti-HBV prophylaxis. Of the 
236  patients with HBV reactivation included in our review, 
148 received NAs (mainly lamivudine or entecavir). The 
mortality rate was relatively high (15%), but the cause of death 
was not always clearly associated with the HBV reactivation, 
particularly in those who had hematological diseases or bone 
marrow transplantation. As might be expected, among the 
patients with HBV reactivation, mortality was 30% for those 
who remained untreated and 12% for those who received 
antiviral therapy. In addition, among the patients who received 
antiviral therapy for HBV reactivation, the mortality was 17% 
for those treated with lamivudine and 3.5% for those treated 
with entecavir. Although these data do not come from RCTs 
and direct comparison is not possible, it seems clinically more 
appropriate to use a high genetic barrier agent, like entecavir 
or tenofovir, whenever HBV reactivation is diagnosed. On the 
other hand, such data regarding antiviral therapy after HBV 
reactivation seem insufficient to justify a change in the current 
recommendation for the use of lamivudine as prophylaxis 
for HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc-positive patients who require 
immunosuppression, provided that serum HBV DNA is 
undetectable.
In conclusion, our findings favor the use of anti-HBV 
prophylaxis in HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc-positive patients 
with hematological diseases and/or under rituximabcontaining regimens, regardless of their baseline anti-HBs 
and serum HBV DNA status. Antiviral prophylaxis should 
be given in HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc-positive patients 
with non-hematological diseases who are taking rituximabfree regimens and have detectable baseline HBV DNA, 
irrespectively of their anti-HBs status, but is not required in 
those with undetectable HBV DNA and positive anti-HBs. 
Since HBV reactivation often occurs after the completion of 
the immunosuppressive/chemotherapy courses, clinicians 
should continue anti-HBV prophylaxis and/or the follow up of 
such patients for at least 12 months after the discontinuation 
of immunosuppression. An agent with a high genetic barrier 
may be used in order to better optimize the management of 
HBV reactivations occurring in HBsAg-negative, anti-HBcpositive patients.

Summary Box
What is already known:
•	 HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc-positive patients have a
lower risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation 
compared to HBsAg-positive patients, but the 
prevalence of anti-HBc is higher than that of 
HBsAg
•	 Antiviral prophylaxis is strongly recommended
in HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc-positive patients 
treated with B-cell-depleting agents
•	 The usefulness of baseline anti-HBs evaluation
remains controversial
What the new findings are:
•	 The use of anti-HBV prophylaxis is recommended
in HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc-positive patients 
with hematological diseases and/or under 
rituximab-containing regimens, regardless of their 
baseline anti-HBs and serum HBV DNA status
•	 Antiviral prophylaxis is not required in HBsAgnegative, anti-HBc-positive patients with nonhematological diseases who receive rituximab-free 
regimens and have undetectable HBV DNA and 
positive anti-HBs
•	 The decision for anti-HBV prophylaxis may be
individualized in patients with non-hematological 
diseases treated with rituximab-free regimens who 
have undetectable HBV DNA and negative antiHBs
•	 Since HBV reactivation often develops after
the completion of the immunosuppressive/
chemotherapy courses, clinicians should continue 
anti-HBV prophylaxis and/or the follow up of such 
patients for at least 12 months after discontinuation 
of immunosuppression
