Abstract. In order to investigate the molecular mechanisms 
underlying the immunosuppressive effects of tacrolimus 
(FK506) on intestinal inflammation, we examined whether 
FK506 effects cytokine/chemokine secretion in human colonic 
myofibroblasts. Human colonic myofibroblasts were isolated 
from normal human colonic tissue. The mRNA and protein 
expression for human CCL2 and CXCL10 were analyzed by 
real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. p38 MAP kinase 
activation was evaluated by western blotting. Tacrolimus 
(1 µM) suppressed tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced 
CCL2 and CXCL10 mRNA expression, but did not modulate 
TNF-α-induced interleukin (IL)-6 or CXCL8 mRNA expression. Dose-dependent, inhibitory effects of tacrolimus on 
CCL2 and CXCL10 expression were observed at the mRNA 
and protein levels. Significant inhibitory effects of tacrolimus 
were observed at concentrations as low as 0.5 µM for CCL2 
and 0.1 µM for CXCL10, respectively. TNF-α-induced CCL2 
and CXCL10 expression depended on p38 MAP kinase activation, and tacrolimus strongly inhibited the TNF-α-induced 
phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase. Tacrolimus did not affect 
interferon (IFN)-γ-induced signaling transducer and activator 
of transcription (STAT)-1 phosphorylation, nor did it modulate 
CXCL10 mRNA and protein expression. In conclusion, tacrolimus suppressed CCL2 and CXCL10 expression in human 
colonic myofibroblasts. These inhibitory effects of tacrolimus 
may play key roles in the therapeutic effects of colonic inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients.
Introduction
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including ulcerative 
colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are chronic and 
relapsing intestinal disorders of unknown etiology (1-5). There 
is currently no pharmaceutical cure for IBD, and hence treatment options aim for inducing and maintaining remission. 
Steroids are used to induce remission but they cannot be used 
to maintain remission (6). Azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, 
methotrexate and biologics such as infliximab or adalimumab 
are all options in treating IBD (7). Despite treatment with these 
agents, a significant number of patients are resistant to conventional therapies and require surgery during the course of the 
disease to relieve their symptoms and to treat complications 
(8,9). Regarding an alternative form of treatment, there is an 
increasing number of reports demonstrating the clinical efficacy of tacrolimus for steroid-dependent or steroid-refractory 
populations of IBD patients (8-14).
Tacrolimus (FK506) is a macrolide immunosuppressive 
agent isolated from Streptomyces tsukubaensis, and was first 
used as an immunosuppressant in transplant patients (9,15-17). 
This immunomodulatory action of tacrolimus is based on its 
ability to disrupt T-cell activation and cytokine expression by 
binding to an intracellular protein called FK binding protein 
(FKBP). The complex of tacrolimus plus FKBP prevents the 
activation of calcineurin, resulting in an inhibition of transcription factor NFAT, which plays an important role in the 
transcriptional activation of genes for interleukin (IL)-2 and 
interferon (IFN)-γ. IL-2 is a potent growth factor for T cells, 
and IFN-γ is a strong inducer of Th1 response (18,19). Thus, 
the major immunosuppressive effects of tacrolimus are considered to be mediated by a suppression of T-cell responses via 
an inhibition of IL-2 and IFN-γ secretion. However, whether 
tacrolimus has immunoregulatory effects on other cell types, 
including mesenchymal cells, remains unclear.
Chemokines and their receptors play a dominant role in 
orchestrating the activity of monocytes/macrophages and 
Tcells in IBD (5), and, in particular, there is evidence that CCL2 
[monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)] and CXCL10 
[interferon-γ-inducible protein-10 (IP-10)] are involved in

human CD (20-23). CCL2 signaling through CCR2 is a key 
factor in the recruitment and activation of monocytes/macrophages, as well as in the recruitment of T cells to mucosal 
lesions (24-26). CXCL10 is a ligand for the CXCR3 receptor, 
the activation of which results in the recruitment of T cells and 
the perpetuation of mucosal inflammation (27).
In the present study, in order to investigate a novel aspect of 
the molecular mechanisms underlying the immunosuppressive 
effects of tacrolimus on intestinal inflammation, we examined 
whether this agent had an impact on cytokine/chemokine secretion in human colonic myofibroblasts. TNF-α plays a pivotal role 
in the pathogenesis of IBD (5,28,29), and is widely-accepted as 
the major target molecule of monoclonal antibody therapy for 
IBD (30). Therefore, we focused on the effects of tacrolimus on 
TNF-α-stimulated cytokine/chemokine [IL-6, CXCL8 (IL-8), 
CCL2 (MCP-1) and CXCL10 (IP-10)] expression in these 
cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the 
immunosuppressive effects of tacrolimus on non-immune cells 
through an inhibition of p38 MAP kinase activation.
Materials and methods
Reagents and antibodies. Recombinant human TNF-α and 
IFN-γ were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, 
MN, USA). Inhibitors of p42/44 MAP kinases (PD98059), and 
an inhibitor of p38 MAP kinases (SB203580) were purchased 
from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., (Beverly, MA, USA). A 
PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) was purchased from CalbiochemMerck Co. (Darmstadt, Germany). All other reagents were 
purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). 
Goat anti-p38 MAP kinase and anti-NF-κB (p65) antibodies 
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. 
Tacrolimus was purchased from Astellas Pharma, Inc. (Tokyo, 
Japan).
Culture of human colonic myofibroblasts. Primary human 
colonic myofibroblasts were isolated and cultured according 
to the method reported by Mahida et al (31). The cellular 
characteristics and culture conditions are also described in our 
previous report (32).
Quantification of human CCL2 and CXCL10. Antigenic CCL2 
and CXCL10 in all samples were quantified by sandwich 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits purchased 
from R&D Systems.
Real-time PCR. The expression of mRNA in the samples 
was assessed by real-time PCR analyses. Real-time PCR was 
performed using a LightCycler 2.0 system (Roche Applied 
Science, Tokyo, Japan). The PCR was performed using a 
SYBR-Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster 
City, CA, USA). The oligonucleotide primers used in this 
study are described in our previous reports (33-35). The data 
were normalized vs. β-actin for human CCL2 and CXCL10.
Western blot analyses. The stimulated cells were lysed in an 
SDS sample buffer containing orthovanadate. Western blot 
analyses were then performed according to the method previously described (34). The detection was performed using the 
enhanced chemiluminescence western blotting system.
Immunohistochemical analysis for p38 MAPK activation. 
The cells were cultured in an 8-well chamber slide system 
(Nalgene, Naperville, IL, USA) for predetermined times. 
The cells were then fixed in cold methanol and acetone, 
and air dried. The samples were incubated with an anti-p38 
MAPK antibody and subsequently incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG 
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA).
Statistical analysis. The statistical significance of the differences was determined by the Mann-Whitney U test (Statview 
version 4.5). Differences resulting in P-values <0.05 were 
considered to be statistically significant.
Results
Effects of tacrolimus on TNF-α-induced cytokine/chemokine 
mRNA expression. Human colonic myofibroblasts were 
stimulated for 24 h with TNF-α (30 ng/ml) in the presence or 
absence of tacrolimus (1 µM), and then the mRNA expression 
for CCL2, CXCL10, IL-6 and CXCL8 (IL-8) was analyzed 
by real-time PCR. TNF-α significantly upregulated the mRNA 
expression for CCL2 and CXCL10, and the presence of tacrolimus (1 µM) markedly suppressed the TNF-α-induced CCL2 
and CXCL10 mRNA expression (Fig. 1A and B). TNF-α also 
induced a significant increase in mRNA expression for IL-6 
and CXCL8, but tacrolimus failed to suppress TNF-α-induced 
IL-6 and CXCL8 mRNA expression (Fig. 1C and D). These 
findings indicate that tacrolimus selectively inhibits TNF-αinduced CCL2 and CXCL10 expression in human colonic 
myofibroblasts.
Dose-dependent inhibitory effects of tacrolimus. Human 
colonic myofibroblasts were stimulated for 24 h with TNF-α
(30 ng/ml) in the presence of increasing concentrations of 
tacrolimus, and the mRNA expression for CCL2 and CXCL10 
was analyzed by real-time PCR. Tacrolimus dose-dependently 
suppressed TNF-α-induced CCL2 and CXCL10 mRNA 
expression (Fig. 2A and B). Significant inhibitory effects for 
tacrolimus were observed at concentrations as low as 0.5 µM 
for CCL2 and 0.1 µM for CXCL10, respectively.
The inhibitory effects of tacrolimus were also investigated 
at the protein level. The cells were stimulated for 24 h with 
TNF-α (30 ng/ml) in the presence of increasing concentrations of tacrolimus, and the CCL2 and CXCL10 secretion into 
the supernatants was analyzed by ELISA. Tacrolimus dosedependently suppressed TNF-α-induced CCL2 and CXCL10 
protein secretion (Fig. 2C and D).
Tacrolimus selectively inhibits p38 MAP kinase activation. 
Previous studies have shown that the activation of NF-κB and 
p38 MAP kinase plays an important role in TNF-α-induced 
CXCL10 expression in various cell types (36-39). In addition, we have previously demonstrated that the activation of 
NF-κB and p38 MAP kinase is involved in TNF-α-induced 
IL-6, CXCL8 and CCL2 expression in human colonic myofibroblasts (40). Based on this background information, we 
investigated how tacrolimus affects the TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of NF-κB and p38 MAP kinase in human colonic 
myofibroblasts. Tacrolimus had no effect on NF-κB p65 phos-

phorylation, suggesting that the inhibition of NF-κB activation 
is not involved in the inhibitory actions of tacrolimus (Fig. 3). 
This is supported by the finding that tacrolimus did not affect 
the TNF-α-induced expression of IL-6 and CXCL8, which 
induction is closely associated with NF-κB activation.
By contrast, tacrolimus strongly inhibited the TNF-αinduced phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase in these cells 
(Fig. 3). Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining for p38 
MAP kinase showed that TNF-α rapidly induced the accumulation of p38 MAP kinase into the nucleus, and that tacrolimus 
completely blocked this response (Fig. 4). To confirm the role 
of p38 MAP kinase in our system, the effects of various MAP 
kinase inhibitors were studied. SB203580 (a specific inhibitor 
for p38 MAP kinase) exhibited significant inhibition against 
TNF-α-induced CCL2 and CXCL10 expression, but p42/44 
MAP kinase inhibitor (PD98059) and a PI3 kinase inhibitor 
(LY294002) had no effect (Fig. 5).
Tacrolimus does not affect IFN-γ-induced CXCL10 expression. We previously demonstrated that IFN-γ induced CXCL10 
expression via the activation of signaling transducer and 
activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) in human colonic myofibroblasts (35). Therefore, we tested the effects of tacrolimus 
on this response. Tacrolimus did not affect IFN-γ-induced 
STAT1 phosphorylation, nor did it modulate CXCL10 mRNA 
or protein expression (Fig. 6). These observations suggest that 
the inhibitory effects of tacrolimus on CXCL10 expression are 
specific for TNF-α-induced responses.
Discussion
In this study, we investigated whether tacrolimus exerted 
inhibitory effects on human colonic myofibroblasts, and found 
that tacrolimus directly inhibited TNF-α-stimulated chemokine (CCL2 and CXCL10) production in these cells. Colonic 
myofibroblasts are significantly involved in the regulation of 
a number of epithelial cell functions, such as proliferation, 
differentiation, and extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism 
affecting the growth of the basement membrane (40). These 
findings indicate that tacrolimus modulates the immunological 
functions of colonic myofibroblasts and contributes to the 
therapeutic action of tacrolimus in IBD patients.
In human colonic myofibroblasts, tacrolimus did not 
modulate TNF-α-induced IL-6 and CXCL8 expression, but 
selectively inhibited TNF-α-induced CCL2 and CXCL10

second antibody. The nuclei were stained with DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole).

NF-κB was evaluated by western blotting. Antibodies against the phosphorylated (p)- and total-p38 MAP kinase and NF-κB p65 subunit were used.

production. Previous studies have demonstrated that the activation of transcription factor NF-κB is critical for the induction 
of all these cytokine/chemokines (IL-6, CXCL8, CCL2 and 
CXCL10). However, the selective inhibitory effects of tacrolimus on CCL2 and CXCL10 suggest that the modulation of 
NF-κB activation is not associated with the inhibitory action 
of tacrolimus. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that 
tacrolimus did not affect the TNF-α-induced phosphorylation 
of the NF-κB p65 subunit. Thus, the inhibitory actions of 
tacrolimus are possibly mediated by molecular mechanisms 
independent of NF-κB activation.
In human colonic myofibroblasts, tacrolimus markedly 
inhibited TNF-α-induced phosphorylation and translocation 
of p38 MAP kinase into the nucleus. The role of p38 MAP 
kinase in the induction of CCL2 and CXCL10 has previously 
been reported (36-39), and the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor 
SB203580 significantly blocked TNF-α-induced CCL2 and 
CXCL10 expression in human colonic myofibroblasts. These 
observations suggest that the inhibitory actions of tacrolimus 
on CCL2 and CXCL10 expression were mainly associated 
with an inhibition of p38 MAP kinase activation.
Several studies describe the role of CCL2/CCR2 and 
CXCL10/CXCR3 in the pathophysiology of IBD (41-43). 
Immunohistochemical staining of gut biopsy samples from 
CD patients revealed infiltrating CD4+ T cells and monocytes/
macrophages that are uniformly positive for CCR2 (21). 
Furthermore, the disease phenotypes of CD have been linked 
to polymorphisms in the CCL2 and CCR2 genes (44,45). On 
the other hand, CXCL10 specifically activates the CXCR3 
receptor, which is predominantly expressed on activated T and 
B cells, natural killer cells, dendritic and macrophage cells 
(46). Manousou et al (43) demonstrated an upregulation of 
CCR3 and its ligands in the inflamed mucosa of IBD patients. 
CXCL10/CXCR3 is strongly expressed in IL-10 KO mice, a 
model of human IBD, and the neutralization of IP-10 attenuated the colitis in this model (47). Thus, CCL2/CCR2- and 
CXCL10/CXCR3-mediated immune responses are regarded 
as the key responses in the pathogenesis of IBD, and the inhibiFigure 6. Effects of tacrolimus (FK506) on IFN-γ-induced STAT1 activation and CXCL10 expression. (A) Colonic myofibroblasts were stimulated for 30 min

against phosphorylated (p)- and total-STAT1 were used. (B) The cells were stimulated for 24 h with IFN-γ (30 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of tacrolimus

normalized vs. β-actin for all subjects. All values are expressed as means ± SD (n=4). **P<0.01. NS, not significant.

[LY294002 (15 µM)] for 24 h, and then the CCL2 and CXCL10 mRNA expression was determined by real-time PCR. The data were normalized vs. β-actin.

tory actions of tacrolimus on CCL2 and CXCL10 production 
from colonic myofibroblasts may be involved in the clinical 
immunosuppressive effects of tacrolimus.
Tacrolimus is clinically used for prophylaxis against 
organ rejection, autoimmune diseases and IBD. It is generally 
accepted that the therapeutic effects of tacrolimus are a result 
of its inhibitory actions on T-cell functions, but there is little 
information concerning the inhibitory effects of tacrolimus 
on non-immune cells such as colonic myofibroblasts. As an 
example of the inhibitory actions of tacrolimus on non-T-cell 
populations, Yoshino et al (48) recently reported the immunosuppressive effects of tacrolimus on macrophages. They 
demonstrated that the proinflammatory cytokine production 
from tacrolimus-treated macrophages was significantly lower 
than that from untreated cells. Tacrolimus suppressed the 
LPS-induced activation of both NF-κB and MAPK in macrophages, and induced the apoptosis of macrophages via the 
activation of caspases-3 and -9. Combined with the observations 
of the present study, tacrolimus may exert its immunosuppressive properties via inhibitory actions on non-T cells, such as 
macrophages and colonic myofibroblasts, as well as T cells.
In conclusion, our results confirm the potential immunosuppressive effects of tacrolimus on human colonic 
myofibroblasts. These inhibitory effects of tacrolimus on 
colonic myofibroblasts may play a significant role in the treatment of colonic inflammation in patients with IBD.
