Abstract
Background: Histologic features of idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension (INCPH) may overlap with those
without INCPH. Recently, these features have been recognized as part of the larger spectrum of porto-sinusoidal
vascular disease (PSVD). We assessed interobserver agreement on histologic features that are commonly associated
with INCPH and studied whether a provision of relevant clinical history improves interobserver agreement.
Methods: The examined histologic features include lobular (such as anisocytosis, nodular regeneration, sinusoidal
dilatation, increased parenchymal draining veins, and incomplete fibrous septa) and portal tract changes (such as
paraportal shunting vessel(s), portal tract remnant, increased number of portal vessels, and obliterative portal
venopathy). Thirty-four archived liver samples from patients with (group A) and without (group B) INCPH were
retrieved. A total of 90 representative images of lobules (L) and portal tracts (P) were distributed among 9 liver
pathologists blinded to true clinical history. Each pathologist answered multiple choice questions based on the
absence (Q1) or presence (Q2) of clinical history of portal hypertension. Fleiss’ kappa coefficient analysis
(unweighted) was performed to assess interobserver agreement on normal versus abnormal diagnosis, in L and P,
based on Q1 and Q2.
Results: The kappa values regarding normal versus abnormal diagnosis were 0.24, 0.24, 0.18 and 0.18 for L-Q1, LQ2, P-Q1, and P-Q2, respectively. With true clinical history provided, the kappa values were L- 0.32, P-0.17 for group
A and L-0.12, P-0.14 for group B. Four pathologists changed their assessments based on the provided history.
Interobserver agreement on the interpretation of L and P as normal versus abnormal was slight to fair regardless of
provision of clinical history.
Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the histologic features of INCPH/PSVD are not limited to patients with
portal hypertension and are subject to significant interobserver variation.

Background
Idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension (INCPH) is
a clinical disorder manifested by signs of portal hypertension in the absence of cirrhosis [1–3]. The diagnosis
is made after excluding known non-cirrhotic causes of
portal hypertension, such as infiltrative liver diseases
(i.e., sarcoidosis), schistosomiasis, portal vein or splenic
vein thrombosis, and Budd-Chiari syndrome, as well as
any forms of chronic liver disease [2]. Previously, different
terminologies were used for this entity encompassing
non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis, idiopathic portal hypertension, hepatoportal sclerosis, obliterative portal venopathy,
and partial nodular transformation. The term INCPH was
first proposed by Shouten et al. in 2011 [1, 3]. Although
the exact etiology of INCPH remains unknown, it appears
to develop as a result of the occlusion of small intrahepatic
branches of the portal vein leading to increased portal
flow resistance [2, 4]. Commonly observed histologic
features include lobular (such as nodular regeneration,
sinusoidal dilatation, increased parenchymal draining
veins, and incomplete fibrous septa) and portal tract
changes (such as paraportal shunting vessel(s), portal tract
remnant, increased number of portal vessels, and obliterative portal venopathy) [1–7]. Indeed, obliterative portal
venopathy is often regarded as the hallmark feature of
INCPH [3].
However, it has been increasingly recognized that
INCPH-like histologic features can be seen in liver samples without evidence of portal hypertension, including
in liver biopsies obtained during cholecystectomy or
gastric bypass, fatty liver disease [8], regressed fibrosis
[9], and normal “control” liver [10]. As such, the clinical
significance of individual or any combination of histologic
features that can be seen in INCPH remains speculative in
daily liver pathology practice. Also, it is unknown whether
such histologic findings can be consistently recognized by
pathologists.
To broaden the definitional spectrum of INCPH and
capture the pre-portal hypertension phase of INCPH, the
Vascular Liver Disease Interest Group (VALDIG) recently
introduced the term “porto-sinusoidal vascular disease”
(PSVD) [11]. This newly proposed term attempts to overcome the shortcomings of previous terminologies by
including patients at earlier stages without evidence of
portal hypertension. Under this new classification, clinical
history of portal hypertension is no longer required for
the diagnosis of PSVD, as long as “specific” histological
features (including obliterative portal venopathy, nodular
regenerative hyperplasia (NRH), and incomplete septal
cirrhosis (ISC)) are present.
However, this broader diagnostic approach to this relatively poorly understood entity raises two specific concerns.
First, it places emphasis primarily on histomorphologic
features for the diagnosis (i.e., obliterative portal venopathy,
NRH, and ISC), despite the fact that these features can be
subtle and lack adequately validated defining criteria.
Second, the nonrestrictive nature of this new classification
broadens the aspects of this disorder to the point where
biopsies that fulfill the criteria for PSVD may not identify
patients with a clinical disease. In fact, to date, the clinical
significance of individual histologic features associated with
INCPH/PSVD in the absence of appropriate clinical context is largely unknown. As noted above, these features may
be discovered incidentally without portal hypertension, and
the risk of progression and long-term outcome in this
setting remain unexplored.
As such, in this study, we evaluated whether liver
pathologists can reach consensus on individual histologic
features that are typically seen in INCPH. We also studied whether provision of clinical history of portal hypertension impacts their assessments of these histologic
features. Furthermore, we applied the recently proposed
histologic criteria for PSVD (i.e., obliterative portal venopathy, NRH, and ISC) to our study cases irrespective of
clinical history and compared the frequencies of true
INCPH and non-INCPH cases that would fulfill the
PSVD criteria, based purely on histologic assessment.
Methods
After approval from the Institutional Review Board at
Albany Medical Center, 34 archived liver samples from
patients with and without INCPH were retrieved. Liver
samples with tumor, cirrhosis, advanced fibrosis, or significant steatosis were excluded. Group A (INCPH group) consisted of 15 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained liver
samples (14 core needle biopsies and 1 wedge biopsy) from
12 patients (mean age: 46, range: 13–76 years, 8 males and
4 females) with portal hypertension. Group B (non-INCP
H) consisted of 19 H&E-stained liver samples (16 core
needle biopsies and 3 wedge biopsies) from 19 patients
(mean age: 46, range: 16–74 years, 9 males and 10 females)
without evidence of INCPH or portal hypertension. One
needle biopsy from group A and three wedge biopsies from
group B were subcapsular sampling, histologically. Ten of
19 group B cases had been used for previous studies [8, 9,
12]. The principal investigator (HL) selected additional 9
cases after assessing histologic features. The indications for
liver biopsy in group B were abnormal liver function tests
(n = 13), intraoperative fatty-appearing liver (n = 2), hyperammonemia (n = 1), evaluation for lung transplant (n = 1)
and unknown (n = 2). Three group B patients had underlying liver diseases without advanced fibrosis: hereditary
hemochromatosis (n = 1), HCV (n = 1), and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency status post liver transplant (n = 1). No
liver disease was documented in the remaining group B patients. Follow-up (mean 38 months, range 1 to 84 months)
was available in 14 of 19 group B patients. No patient developed portal hypertension at the end of the follow-up.
Kmeid et al. Diagnostic Pathology (2020) 15:129 Page 2 of 9

A total of 90 images of lobules and portal tracts were
captured by the principal investigator to allow for both
overall and focused assessment of lobular and portal
tract changes. The images included 45 from the lobules
(labeled as L1 to L45) and 45 from the portal tracts
(labeled as P1 to P45), and then were distributed to 9
liver pathologists from 8 different institutions. The
participants were blinded to the original diagnosis and
clinical history (Fig. 1).
The pathologists were asked to evaluate each image
under 2 scenarios: Q1: If there is no clinical history of
portal hypertension, is this image of lobule or portal
tract considered within normal limits or not? Q2: If
there is a clinical history of portal hypertension (in other
words, you start to consider a possibility of INCPH in
this case), is this image of lobule or portal tract considered within normal limits or not? For the 90 images, the
pathologists were asked to choose between “within normal limits” (choice a) and multiple choices (to choose at
least one) if the image was considered abnormal, based
on Q1 and Q2. The choices for abnormal lobular images
were: (b) anisocytosis; (c) nodular regeneration; (d) sinusoidal dilatation; (e) increased parenchymal draining veins,
and (f) incomplete fibrous septa. Anisocytosis was included as one of the answer choices to test its potential
utility as a surrogate for NRH. The choices for abnormal
portal images were: (b) paraportal shunting vessel(s); (c)
portal tract remnant; (d) increased number of portal
vessels, and (e) obliterative portal venopathy (Table 1).
Previously proposed diagnostic criteria for each of
these lobular and portal changes were provided to
participating pathologists along with the reference article
containing representative microscopic images [13]. In
addition, an article describing a detailed morphometric
analysis of normal adult human liver was provided as a
reference for normal liver [14]. The definitions are as
follows: nodular regeneration - parenchymal micronodular transformation with central hyperplasia and peripheral atrophy without fibrosis; increased parenchymal
draining veins - multiple dilated parenchymal veins clustered in the lobule; incomplete fibrous septa - thin,
blindly ending septa; paraportal shunting vessel(s) - enlarged thin-walled vessels outside, but in close contact
with the portal tract; portal tract remnant - a portal tract
of which the size is smaller than twice the diameter of
the bile duct; increased number of portal vessels - multiple small vascular channels in portal tract; obliterative
portal venopathy - portal vein with a reduced lumen in a
fibrotic portal tract [7, 10, 13].
When 6 or more pathologists chose the same answer
for a certain image, the answer was considered as “consensus.” We counted the number of images that reached

consensus in each category (L-Q1, L-Q2, P-Q1, and PQ2). For each answer choice (L: a to e, P: a to f), we
counted how many times a consensus was achieved for
the specific answer choice, for Q1 and Q2, respectively.
We then calculated the difference in the consensus
number between Q1 and Q2 for each answer. For instance, if answer “b” is the consensus answer for 5 lobular images when Q1 was provided, and for 10 lobular
images for Q2, the difference would be 10–5 = + 5. Thus,
by provision of Q2 history (i.e., clinical history of portal
hypotension), 5 additional images are agreed upon to
represent “b” by ≥6 pathologists. The interpretation of
the image was considered “reproducible” when consensus was reached on both Q1 and Q2, non-reproducible
when the provision of Q1/Q2 history changed the
consensus status (i.e., consensus to no consensus or vice
versa), and divergent when no consensus was reached
on both Q1 and Q2. Fleiss’ kappa statistic was used to
assess the interobserver agreement on each image. We
also evaluated if this agreement is impacted by clinical
history (Fig. 1). Kappa (unweighted) values between
0.01–0.20 were considered slight, 0.21–0.40 fair, 0.41–
0.60 moderate, 0.61–0.80 substantial, and 0.81–1.00
almost perfect agreement. Z-scores were then calculated
and converted to a p-value. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS statistics online software.
Cases from INCPH (group A) and non-INCPH (group
B) were re-assessed according to the recently proposed
histologic criteria for PSVD by two authors (MK and

HL) using whole slides. PSVD diagnosis can be rendered
based on the presence of one or more histologic lesions,
including obliterative portal venopathy, NRH, and ISC
[11]. To focus on histologic components of PSVD,
clinical signs of portal hypertension were not used for
evaluation. The number of cases that would have been
classified as PSVD due to the presence of any one (or
more) of these histologic lesions, regardless of clinical
history, was counted from groups A and B, and compared with Fisher’s exact test. P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
Interobserver study
Overall consensus was reached for 60–73% of the images for each category (L-Q1, L-Q2, P-Q1, and P-Q2).
Interobserver agreement regarding whether the pathologists considered the image within normal limits (a) or
not (non-a) was slight to fair (Table 2). However, when
the clinical history of portal hypertension was provided,
there were differences in the interpretation of the
images with the largest difference in consensus with
regard to anisocytosis (− 10), followed by incomplete
fibrous septa (+ 6), increased number of portal vessels
(+ 5), paraportal shunting vessel(s) (+ 4), and portal
tract remnant (+ 3) (Table 2) (Figs. 2 and 3). Four pathologists changed the interpretation based on provided
history of portal hypertension. The mean number of
images where diagnosis was impacted by clinical history
was 40 (range: 10–70 images). However, the impact on
the degree of agreement as manifested by the Fleiss’
kappa value was not significantly different between the
kappa values for Q1 and Q2.
In group A (INCPH group), the interpretations of within
normal limits (n = 10, 4 L, 6P), sinusoidal dilatation (n = 5),
and increased parenchymal draining veins (n = 3) were reproducible (i.e., consensus was reached by ≥6 pathologists
on both Q1 and Q2), while the interpretations of nodular
regeneration and increased number of portal vessels were
either non-reproducible (i.e., consensus to no consensus or
vice versa) or divergent (i.e., no consensus was reached on
both Q1 and Q2). In group B (non-INCPH group), the interpretations of within normal limits (n = 8, 2 L, 6P), sinusoidal dilatation (n = 4), and paraportal shunting vessel(s)
(n = 3) were reproducible, whereas the interpretations of
nodular regeneration, incomplete fibrous septa, increased
number of portal vessels, and obliterative portal venopathy
were either non-reproducible or divergent (Table 2).
Histologic re-classification of PSVD
When the cases from INCPH (group A) and non-INCP
H (group B) were re-assessed for the presence of specific
histologic lesions for PSVD (i.e., obliterative portal venopathy, NRH, and ISC), irrespective of clinical history of
portal hypertension, 9 of 15 (60%) group A cases and 7
of 19 (37%) group B cases were classified as PSVD (p >
0.05) (Additional file 1).
Discussion
The approach to the diagnosis of INCPH on liver biopsies has been, to a certain extent, conservative. It is well
recognized that histologic changes of INCPH can be
subtle, patchy, and nonspecific, as they can be seen in a
variety of other liver diseases. In fact, Guido et al. emphasized the importance of obtaining clinical history and
correlating with imaging before making a diagnosis of

INCPH on a liver biopsy [2]. For liver biopsies performed in the setting of abnormal liver function tests of
unknown etiology and in the absence of portal hypertension, the presence of histologic findings suggestive of
INCPH should be interpreted with caution, but a diagnosis of INCPH could be suggested with the possibility
of a preclinical phase of the disease [2]. On the other
hand, the newly proposed PSVD classification identifies
three specific histologic features (namely, obliterative
portal venopathy, NRH, and ISC) which, when present,
are sufficient for the diagnosis even in the absence of
any clinical or radiological evidence of portal hypertension, as long as the sampling is adequate (liver biopsy
≥20 mm) and cirrhosis is absent [11]. In other words,
PSVD is no longer restricted to cases with evidence
of portal hypertension but encompasses a broader
spectrum of hepatic vascular-type injury pattern [15].
However, as noted before, these histologic features
can be seen in non-INCPH/PSVD cases, and their
relevance in the diagnosis of INCPH/PSVD remains
unknown.
In this regard, our results demonstrate that interobserver agreement on the interpretation of lobular and
portal images for INCPH, even when assessed by liver
pathologists, is fair at most, regardless of provision of
clinical history. Although consensus was achieved for
60–73% of the provided images for each category (L-Q1,
L-Q2, P-Q1, and P-Q2), the corresponding kappa values
remained relatively unsatisfactory. The level of interobserver agreement did not improve even when true clinical histories were provided for the images although
about a half of the participating pathologists changed
their assessment based on the provided clinical history.
While our group was not in agreement as to whether
clinical history should be a factor when assessing whether
a feature was present or absent, this appears to reflect the
prevailing recognition that clinical context is of utmost
importance when evaluating potential INCPH cases.
The most volatile histologic features that were affected
by clinical history were anisocytosis, incomplete fibrous
septa, and increased number of portal vessels. Likewise,
there was no reproducibility for nodular regeneration
and increased number of portal vessels in both groups A
(INCPH) and B (non-INCPH), and for incomplete fibrous septa and obliterative portal venopathy in group
B. These findings seem to suggest that nodular regeneration, incomplete fibrous septa, obliterative portal venopathy, and increased number of portal vessels will likely

consensus was reached on provision of Q2 history (with portal hypertension) as follows: a, nodular regeneration; b, sinusoidal dilatation; c,

are from idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension (INCPH) group; c is from non-INCPH group [A-D, hematoxylin and eosin, × 100]

remain as the most difficult features to recognize
consistently in INCPH/PSVD, in which the former three
are considered specific for PSVD. In fact, NRH is often
regarded as a subtle finding with low interobserver
agreement among liver pathologists [16]. Based on our
reproducibility study results, a pathologist can consider
INCPH as a possibility when sinusoidal dilatation along
with the increased number of parenchymal draining
veins is recognized, in the right clinical context.
Overall, these results suggest that histologic findings
commonly associated with INCPH/PSVD can be seen in
ostensibly normal livers and in a broader group of liver
disorders. Indeed, after reviewing the cases for the presence of specific histologic features for PSVD (irrespective of signs of portal hypertension), 37% of group B
(non-INCPH group) cases were reclassified as PSVD by
two authors. This further reinforces the notion that
histologic features of INCPH/PSVD are not limited to
patients with portal hypertension. Our findings also
confirm the previous notion that it may be extremely
difficult to make an accurate diagnosis of INCPH without proper clinical context.
Given the marked histologic overlap between INCPH
and non-INCPH cases, with at most fair interobserver
agreement, it will be challenging to identify a subset of
PSVD cases that represent INCPH with associated risk
factors, for whom a management implication should be
inferred. Also, given that the diagnosis of PSVD primarily relies on recognition of “specific” histologic features,
implementation of more well-defined criteria for each
histopathologic feature would be needed to improve
diagnostic accuracy and reduce interobserver variation.
However, the fact that the specific histologic features of
PSVD tended to be more common in INCPH (group A)
than non-INCPH (group B) (Additional file 1) seems to
suggest that there may be some differences in the severity and extent of these histologic changes between the
two groups.
The main strength of our study is that 9 liver pathologists with different training backgrounds participated in
the study. The fact that the pathologists were blinded to
the original diagnosis and clinical history was useful in
minimizing any potential observer bias, even though the
participants knew that they were involved in an INCPH
study. However, there are some limitations to our study
as well. For instance, the principal investigator selected
non-INCPH cases and the specific areas to be captured
digitally in both groups A and B, potentially leading to a
Fig. 3 Representative portal tract images assessed by pathologists. No consensus was reached on these images on Q1 (no portal hypertension),
but consensus was reached on provision of Q2 history (with portal hypertension) as follows: a, paraportal shunting vessels; b, portal tract remnant
(arrow); c, increased number of portal vessels; d, obliterative portal venopathy. d is from idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension (INCPH)
group; a-c are from non-INCPH group [a-d, hematoxylin and eosin, × 200]

selection bias. Although these images still allowed for
both overall and focused assessment of lobular and
portal tract changes, one may argue that whole digitized
or glass slides should have been used for the study.
However, we felt that our approach was justified, since
histologic changes of INCPH can be very subtle and
patchy, and the main objective of our study was to determine interobserver agreement on individual histologic
features by having all the participating pathologists
examine the exact same areas of lobular and portal tract
changes. In support of this, Jharap et al. demonstrated
that interobserver agreement on NRH remained poor
even when pathologists reviewed the entire slides [16].
Conclusions
Interpretation of individual histologic features of INCPH
is subjected to high degree of interobserver variability
and may be influenced by clinical history. Moreover, the
histologic features of INCPH are not limited to patients
with portal hypertension. With the broadened spectrum
of PSVD, histologic assessment of PSVD is likely to remain
challenging. Consensus discussion may enhance the diagnostic accuracy of different histologic features that may be
encountered within the range of this entity. Most importantly, rigorous clinical validation of those histologic criteria
is needed; which will enable us to refine diagnostic criteria
and understand clinical significance of those findings.
