Abstract
Three-dimensional (3D) visualization involves feature extraction and 3D reconstruction of CT images using a computer 
processing technology. It is a tool for displaying, describing, and interpreting 3D anatomy and morphological features of 
organs, thus providing intuitive, stereoscopic, and accurate methods for clinical decision-making. It has played an increasingly 
signifcant role in the diagnosis and management of liver diseases. Over the last decade, it has been proven safe and efective to use 3D simulation software for pre-hepatectomy assessment, virtual hepatectomy, and measurement of liver volumes 
in blood fow areas of the portal vein; meanwhile, the use of 3D models in combination with hydrodynamic analysis has 
become a novel non-invasive method for diagnosis and detection of portal hypertension. We herein describe the progress of 
research on 3D visualization, its workfow, current situation, challenges, opportunities, and its capacity to improve clinical 
decision-making, emphasizing its utility for patients with liver diseases. Current advances in modern imaging technologies 
have promised a further increase in diagnostic efcacy of liver diseases. For example, complex internal anatomy of the liver 
and detailed morphological features of liver lesions can be refected from CT-based 3D models. A meta-analysis reported 
that the application of 3D visualization technology in the diagnosis and management of primary hepatocellular carcinoma 
has signifcant or extremely signifcant diferences over the control group in terms of intraoperative blood loss, postoperative complications, recovery of postoperative liver function, operation time, hospitalization time, and tumor recurrence on 
short-term follow-up. However, the acquisition of high-quality CT images and the use of these images for 3D visualization 
processing lack a unifed standard, quality control system, and homogeneity, which might hinder the evaluation of application 
efcacy in diferent clinical centers, causing enormous inconvenience to clinical practice and scientifc research. Therefore, 
rigorous operating guidelines and quality control systems need to be established for 3D visualization of liver to develop it 
to become a mature technology. Herein, we provide recommendations for the research on diagnosis and management of 3D 
visualization in liver diseases to meet this urgent need in this research feld.

about revolutionary changes to the accurate diagnosis and 
management of liver diseases [4–6]. By means of this technology, individualized display of both complex internal 
anatomy of liver and spatial information of liver and its 
surrounding organs enables surgeons to “see more”, to 
“see better”, and to “see more accurately”; it also enables surgeons to obtain relatively comprehensive information available for assisting clinical decision-making 
[7]. In the past, clinicians used to transform 2D information into abstract 3D models in their minds with the aid 
of their personal experience. Nonetheless, the limitation 
and uncertainty of their experience may lead to an uncertain and inconsistent reconstruction outcome. While 3D 
reconstructed models or 3D printed models can visualize and intuitively display variations of intrahepatic blood 
vessels, and provide a convenient and accurate method 
for liver volume calculation, virtual simulation surgery, 
and surgical navigation [8, 9]. Moreover, the non-invasive 
evaluation of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) 
using quantitative imaging, combined with 3D model and 
hemodynamics, is a promising method for the diagnosis 
and monitoring of portal hypertension [10, 11].
The development of 3D simulation software for liver 
surgery permitted surgeons to perform surgical planning 
and virtual hepatectomy on 3D models [12]. Subsequent 
advances in technology improved the 3D simulation software to estimate liver volume based on portal venous blood 
fow, and studies have shown a clear correlation between the 
simulated hepatectomy and actual hepatectomy volumes [8, 
13]. Since 2012, 3D image-assisted liver surgery has been 
covered by the national health insurance in Japan, afrming the role of 3D preoperative simulation for liver surgery 
[14]. In China, the Digital Medicine Branch of the Chinese 
Medical Association has reached expert consensuses and 
guidelines on the application of 3D visualization technology 
(3DVT) for the accurate diagnosis and treatment of complicated liver tumors, hilar cholangiocarcinoma, hepatolithiasis, pancreatic head cancer, gallbladder carcinoma, and 
retroperitoneal tumors, as well as application of computerassisted indocyanine green fuorescence imaging technology 
in the diagnosis and surgical navigation of liver tumors [15], 
forming standardized protocols for the use of 3D visualization [16]. At present, 3D simulation software systems have 
received widespread acceptance in terms of preoperative 
evaluation, surgical planning, and intraoperative navigation 
of liver diseases [5, 17, 18]. There are many alternative 3D 
reconstruction software programs available in the market 
that can be used for liver surgery simulation, such as HepaVision (Mevis, Germany) [19, 20], Liver Analyzer (Mevis, 
Germany) [21], MI-3DVS (Southern Medical University, 
China) [7], 3D VSP and VR-Anat (IRCAD, France) [22], 
Scout Liver and Explorer Liver (Pathfnder Technologies, 
USA) [23], SYNAPSE VINCENT (Fujiflm Medical, Japan) 
[24], Virtual Place (AZE, Japan) [25], and Hitachi Image 
Processing System (Hitachi Medical, Japan) [26], etc.
Three-dimensional visualization has a great potential in 
displaying lesion information and guiding diagnosis and 
treatment. At meta-analysis, the application of 3D visualization technology in the diagnosis and management of primary hepatocellular carcinoma was found to have extremely 
signifcant diferences in reducing (a) intraoperative blood 
loss, (b) postoperative complications, (c) operating time and 
hospitalization time, and (d) recurrence rate of liver cancer 
in short-term follow-up and accelerating the recovery of 
postoperative liver function signifcantly [27]. There is, however, inevitable heterogeneity due to the diferences in diseases and operations by diferent surgeons [28, 29]. Thus, it 
remains a main challenge to acquire high-quality CT images, 
and conduct 3D reconstruction and visualization analysis 
using homogeneous, standardized, and quality controlled 
systems to achieve comprehensive refection of lesion information by 3D models that could assist physicians in clinical 
decision-making. The previous reports on 3D visualization 
mainly focus on how 3D models have changed clinical practice of liver diseases [5, 29]; however, the reconstruction of 
these models lacks a homogeneous and standardized processing, and clinical consistency and practical evaluation. 
Therefore, these models possibly with reconstruction errors 
may not be suitable for clinical practice.
In this consensus, we describe the workfow of 3D visualization along with its latest advances in the diagnosis and 
management of liver diseases. The opportunities and challenges presented by 3D visualization to improve individualized accurate diagnosis and management of liver diseases 
are highlighted, with an emphasis on the importance of 
homogeneous and standardized 3D reconstruction process 
and quality control system. Finally, we envision the future 
development direction and new opportunities of 3D visualization in clinical practice.
This consensus refers to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE), 
which divides the quality of evidence into high, moderate, 
and low or very low levels. These levels of evidence are 
reported with the letter grades of A, B, and C, respectively 
(Table 1) [30–32]. The strength of recommendation, formed 
by GRADE grid method (Table 1), was divided into strong 
(1) and weak (2) recommendations. Participated experts 
voted to determine the strength of recommendation based 
on the quality of evidence, patient values, and preferences.
The workfow of 3D visualization
3DVT refers to the visualization of human body information refected on CT images into 3D efects on a computer, 
thus providing structural information unable to be obtained 

Hepatology International (2020) 14:437–453 439

from 2D images (Fig. 1). 3D visualization processing mainly 
includes the following steps: CT data acquisition, image 
processing and 3D reconstruction, image registration, and 
fusion and visualization analysis. For complicated liver diseases, noticeably, 3D reconstruction can be performed based 
on fusion imaging combining MRI venous phase and CT 
venous phase [2]. To evaluate and guarantee the quality of 
3DVT, we have established the quality control system and 
3D visualization quality score (3DVQS) (Fig. 2).
Acquisition of CT data
A routine plain CT should be performed in the supine position with a scan range from the top of the diaphragm to 
the lower level of both kidneys to ensure coverage of the 
entire liver and the portal vein. The scanning range should 
be adjusted according to each patient’s clinical status, and 
the scanning parameters should be set according to the specifc CT scanner. Dynamic phases in the setting of diferent 
liver pathologies should be noted. For patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, attention should be paid to the image 
quality of arterial phase, portal venous phase, and delayed 
phase, and for those with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma 
and hilar cholangiocarcinoma in particular, attention should 
be paid to the image quality of delayed phase; for those with 
hepatolithiasis, attention should be paid to image quality 
of plain scan phase and portal venous phase. Multiphase 
images (plain scan phase, arterial phase, portal venous 
phase, and delayed phase) should be obtained by a 64-slice 
or above helical CT scanner, with a section thickness of 
0.625–1 mm. Data should be archived in the DICOM format and exported by storage equipment. CT parameters: 
cross-sectional scanning, tube voltage 100–140 kV, or set 
the optimal voltage based on patient size and weight, slice 
thickness 0.625–1 mm, pitch 0.891–0.915, large scan feld 
of view, standard reconstruction algorithm, and thin-layer 
reconstruction if necessary. Scanning procedure and protocol: routine plain scan of upper abdomen. Typically, a watersoluble iodine medium is administered by rapid bolus injection. For bolus injection, the usual dose is 1.0 to 2.0 ml/kg 
(1.5 ml/kg for obese patients) at an injection rate of 4.7 to 
5.0 ml/s with scanning begun immediately after administration. Usually, triple-phase scanning should be adopted, i.e., 
arterial phase, portal venous phase, and delayed phase. The 
original scanning time is set based on plain scan, and the 
timing of the delay is synchronized with the start of injection. The arterial phase scan is triggered by the threshold 
triggering protocol or starts at a delay of 20–30 s. The portal 
venous and delayed scans start at a delay of 60–70 s and

2 min, respectively, from the beginning of contrast agent 
administration [17, 33, 34].
Image processing and 3D visualization
The acquired DICOM data should be imported into a 3D 
reconstruction software for data segmentation. The original 
2D images of abdominal organs, lesions, and vascular system can be reconstructed automatically, with the intrahepatic 
vascular branches reaching the level of 3–4. Based on the 
automatically generated liver contour and vascular model, 
at least one abdominal imaging attending and one attending physician should collaborate to determine, manually 
check and modify the lesion scope; in case of disagreement, 
negotiate and discuss or refer to another senior physician to 
ensure a more accurate 3D visualization image; this process 
is particularly important in the 3D reconstruction of some 
complicated diseases.
Three‑dimensional visualization
Based on the 3D models reconstructed by original CT 
images, the shape and spatial distribution of the target, such 
as the liver, biliary tract, blood vessels, tumors, or stones, 
can be defned and delineated; in addition, the target can be 
separated visually, accurately, and rapidly. Thus, the clinical 
decision for accurate preoperative diagnosis, individualized 
surgical planning, and selection of surgical approach can 
be provided [35]. 3D visualization mainly centers upon the 
following aspects:
Individualized evaluation of hepatic lesions: based on the 
3D images, the size, morphology, and location of lesions 
Fig. 2 Flowchart depicting the workfow of the application of the 
3DVQS. The workfow includes necessary steps in a 3D visualization 
analysis. The 3DVQS both rewards and penalizes the methodology 
and analyses of a study, consequently encouraging optimal and standardized clinical practice

(tumors or stones) can be evaluated, and the same is true for 
the evaluation of the anatomical relationship between lesions 
and intrahepatic vessels to guide surgical treatment [36].
Individualized evaluation of the morphology of biliary system with biliary diseases: individualized anatomical variation 
can be analyzed and evaluated based on the 3D visualization 
classifcation system for biliary system, which can display the 
biliary system stereoscopically. In the presence of hepatolithiasis, the size of stones and their distribution in each hepatic 
segment, and the extent and range of biliary stenosis can be 
clearly displayed [17, 37]. It is recommended to use minimum 
intensity projection (min MIP) processing with CT to improve 
biliary conspicuity. Patients with normal biliary system can be 
assessed and classifed with MRI.
Individualized evaluation of the morphology of hepatic 
arterial system: according to Michel’s classifcation for hepatic 
artery variants [38], the origin of left and right hepatic arteries, the presence of accessory hepatic artery and other vascular variations should be evaluated based on 3D images; the 
hepatic artery variants should be evaluated according to the 
3D classifcation system for hepatic artery.
Individualized evaluation of the morphology of hepatic 
venous system: the course and variation of hepatic vein should 
be evaluated based on the 3D classifcation system for hepatic 
vein. The variations of right posterior inferior hepatic vein, 
segment IV hepatic vein, and segment VIII hepatic vein have 
signifcant value in the decision-making of liver surgery [39, 
40].
Individualized evaluation of the morphology of portal 
venous system: the anatomical variations of left branch, right 
branch and trunk of portal vein, splenic vein, and superior 
mesenteric vein should be evaluated according to the 3D classifcation system for portal vein [41].
Individualized liver segmentation and volume calculation: 
the individualized liver segmentation and volume calculation 
should be performed according to the topological relation of 
portal vein blood fow, and meanwhile, the volume calculation 
of any portal vein branch drainage area can be conducted. The 
optimal virtual resection plane should be determined according to the tumor location, together with the distance and spatial 
relationship between the tumor and the intrahepatic vascular 
system; the volume of the remaining functional liver should be 
calculated through simulation surgery, and meanwhile, postoperative integrity of venous drainage and portal vein blood 
supply of each hepatic segment retained should be ensured. 
For major liver resection or living liver donations, volume calculation is equally necessary [8, 42]
Quality control system of 3DVT
To better apply 3DVT in the field of liver diseases, it is 
urgently needed to establish a standardized evaluation and 
homogeneous operation fow. We have put forward the quality 
control system and 3DVQS based on the following three critical criteria: preoperative 3D surgical simulation, intraoperative 
3D surgical navigation, and postoperative 3D reconstruction; 
they have been further identifed as 16 criteria, each of which 
is elaborated in Table 2 [15].
Recommendation 1 Operator: Sufcient anatomical basis 
and solid knowledge of liver surgery are required, along with 
at least 30 cases of standardized operation training (B, Strong 
recommendation)
Recommendation 2 Examinee: The patient should fast for at 
least 4 h prior to CT exam, rest for 10–20 min, and hold their 
breath during scanning (B, Strong recommendation).
Recommendation 3 Homogeneous 3D model: It is suggested to select 64-slice or above helical scanner with a slice 
thickness of 0.625–1.0 mm for 3D reconstruction (A, Strong 
recommendation).
Recommendation 4 It is suggested that the original 3D 
model be repeatedly discussed, verifed and modifed by at 
least 2 abdominal imaging attendings and at least 2 attending 
physicians (A, Strong recommendation).
Recommendation 5 It is suggested that analysis of hepatic 
veins, hepatic arteries, portal veins, and bile ducts should be 
performed by at least 1 abdominal imaging attending and 
1 attending physician for vascular system classifcation (A, 
Strong recommendation).
Recommendation 6 It is suggested to perform virtual simulation surgery using 3D model before operation, to select the 
optimal surgical approach and surgical resection plane, and 
calculate the residual functional liver volume on an individual 
basis (A, Strong recommendation).
Recommendation 7 It is suggested to determine the fnal 
surgical planning by combining the results of MDT discussion 
based on 3D visualization, as well as the wishes of patients and 
their family (A, Strong recommendation).
Recommendation 8 It is recommended to measure the 
volume of liver specimen and compare it with that of virtual 
resection to obtain the discrepancy between surgical planning 
and actual operation (A, Strong recommendation).
Recommendation 9 For patients with liver diseases diagnosed and treated by 3D visualization, it is recommended to 
follow the quality control steps of 3DVT and conduct quality 
scoring, which is conducive to standardize the efect of clinical 
evaluation (A, Strong recommendation).

Criteria for quality scoring
At present, many studies on preoperative 3D simulated liver 
surgery have been reported; nevertheless, it is difcult to 
reach any homogenization due to the inconsistent quality of 
3D models reconstructed by diferent 3D reconstruction software. Despite their certain automatic and intelligent characteristics, the liver contour and vascular model generated 
automatically still need to be manually checked and modifed to minimize deviation and to improve the efectiveness 
of the 3D model [15].
Recommendation 10 It is necessary to follow the quality 
control steps and conduct quality scoring, no matter what 3D 
visualization software is used (A, Strong recommendation).
Potential for application and promotion
The establishment of a homogeneous quality control system 
and 3D visualization quality score is helpful to standardize 
the application and promotion of 3DVT in the diagnosis and 
treatment of liver diseases. The core contents of homogenization research proposed by this consensus include acquisition of high-quality CT images, 3D reconstruction, simulated vascular resection and reconstruction, individualized 
liver volume calculation, and virtual hepatectomy. Therefore, it is suggested that a 3D reconstruction software should 
be used in institutions where condition permits to evaluate 
virtual hepatectomy to improve the safety of surgery [15].
Diagnosis and management of complicated 
liver tumor by 3D visualization
Currently, the defnition of complicated liver tumor is controversial [15, 43]; it generally refers to centrally located 
hepatocellular carcinoma involving the porta hepatis; 
variations of hepatic artery, portal vein, and hepatic vein 
within the liver; serious distortion of intrahepatic vessels 
due to massive compression of tumor; malignant liver 
tumors with inferior vena cava or even right atrial cancer 
thrombus; massive benign or malignant tumors of the liver 
requiring extensive hepatectomy; hepatic tumors involving 
hepatic segments I and VII that require complex hepatectomy. Individualized 3D reconstruction enables surgeons 
to visualize, describe, and analyze complex intrahepatic 
structures and anatomic relationships of tumors, especially 
in patients with large tumors or with tumor compression of 
important blood vessels requiring extended hepatectomy 
(≥3 segments) [44, 45], which is associated with a higher 
risk of postoperative liver failure. Thus, it is signifcant to 
conduct the accurate and comprehensive preoperative evaluation and reasonable formulation of surgical planning.
Recommendation 11 For patients with complicated liver 
tumors requiring hepatectomy, it is recommended that 3D 
visualization of portal vein classifcation be carried out to 
comprehend the course, variation, and its relationship with 
tumor (A, Strong recommendation).
Classifcation of 3D visualization models 
for centrally located hepatocellular 
carcinoma
The central region of the liver mainly consists of hepatic 
segments IV, V, or VIII, the upper boundary of which is 
the junction of the three hepatic veins with the inferior 
vena cava, the lower boundary is the middle part of the 
anterior hepatic margin, the left margin is the falciform 
ligament, the right margin is the right intersectoral fssure, 
and the abaxial side, connected to the hepatic caudate lobe, 
is adjacent to the inferior vena cava and the frst hepatic 
portal. Therefore, centrally located hepatocellular carcinoma can be defned as a liver cancer adjacent to the main 
hepatic branches, such as hepatic vein, portal vein, bile 
duct system, or retrohepatic inferior vena cava, or a liver 
cancer with a distance of less than 1 cm [46, 47].
3D visualization classification of centrally located 
hepatocellular carcinoma (Fang’s classifcation) can be 
divided into the fve types [7] (Table 3).
Recommendation 12: For patients with a centrally 
located hepatocellular carcinoma, 3D visualization classifcation should be used to select the corresponding recommended surgical method (A, Strong recommendation).

Three‑dimensional visualization 
classifcation of complicated hepatocellular 
carcinoma with blood vessels as the axis
Hepatectomy mainly involves the portal vein, hepatic vein, 
inferior vena cava, and hepatic artery systems. Therefore, 
this consensus proposes a 3D visualization classifcation 
system for complicated hepatocellular carcinoma with 
blood vessels as the axis to guide surgery (Table 4) [47].
Recommendation 13: Perform digitalized classifcation, 
resectability evaluation, and surgical planning of blood 
vessels as the axis for complicated liver tumor using 3D 
visualization technology to achieve anatomical, functional,

Guidance of 3DVT for other therapeutic 
methods of hepatocellular carcinoma
Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and transcatheter portal vein embolization (PVE) are considered useful 
treatment modalities for hepatocellular carcinoma [48]. By 
means of 3DVT, the main blood artery supply and its small 
branches supplying the tumor can be clearly displayed, and 
an accurate 3D "vessel-tumor" model can be provided for 
hepatic artery variations [49, 50]; 3D visualization of the 
main portal vein and its branches can be used to guide the 
compensated hepatic proliferation induced by portal vein 
embolization to increase the volume of functional liver 
[51]. 3DVT can also provide a preoperative 3D approach 
for percutaneous liver tumor radiofrequency ablation and 
argon–helium knife technology, and accurately measure the 
volume of intraoperative electrode probe failure range.
Recommendation 14: For patients undergoing TACE, 
tumor ablation, and argon–helium knife, 3D visualization 
technology should be used to evaluate the condition of 
hepatic artery (A, Strong recommendation).
The application of 3D printing 
in complicated liver surgery
3D reconstructed images can well show the 3D relationship 
between important blood vessels, biliary structure, and liver 
parenchyma. However, there is still a lack of authenticity in 
displaying 3D images on a 2D computer screen. Due to the 
lack of reliable liver surface markers, it is still difcult to 
achieve intraoperative guidance of 3D images; meanwhile, 
the morphological changes caused by traction of the liver 
and respiratory movement have been claimed to be the key 
constraints. These obstacles are expected to be overcome 
using high-precision 3D printing models [52, 53]. Figure 3 demonstrates the resection of a complex right hepatic 
tumor guided by 3D reconstruction in combination with 3D 
printing. Apart from reconstruction by a 3D visualization 
software, a further 3D printed model can truly restore the 
characteristics of the organs in vivo and approximate reality 
based on 3DVT. The advantages are described as follows 
[54–56]: (1) the location, size, and shape of the tumor can 
be faithfully represented, and the relationship between the 
tumor and vascular systems can be observed from diferent 
perspectives. (2) Real-time navigation can be provided during the operation, and vital positions can be identifed and 
located quickly.
Recommendation 15: For patients with complicated 
liver tumors, preoperative 3D printed model might be used 
to guide the actual surgical procedure if the hospital has 
an appropriate post-processing workstation (B, Strong 
recommendation).
Diagnosis and treatment of hilar 
cholangiocarcinoma guided by 3D 
visualization technology
Hilar cholangiocarcinoma is one of the most common 
biliary malignancies. Surgery is the only treatment for 
these patients to obtain long-term survival [57]. Generally, Bismuth–Corlette Classifcation is used to evaluate the extent of tumor invasion in the biliary tract; the 
MSKCCT grading system is used to evaluate the extent 
of tumor invasion in the portal vein and the condition of 
Table 4 Three-dimensional visualization classifcation of complicated hepatocellular carcinoma with blood vessels as the axis

liver atrophy. Combining the advantages of the two methods, we classify hilar cholangiocarcinoma into six types 
(Fang’s classifcation) (Table 5; Fig. 4) [25, 58, 59]. Since 
the characteristics of lymph nodes cannot be defned by 
3DVT, this consensus does not involve the content of this 
feld. Through 3DVT analysis of the P and U points (the 
limit of the dissection points of the portal vein and biliary duct of the normal type, U point: the reverse turn of 
the horizontal part and sagittal part of the portal vein left 
branch; P point: the bifurcation of right-anterior branch 
and right posterior branch of portal vein), the P and U 
points of the common type of portal vein or the variant 
portal vein can be observed on 3D [60, 61]. Thus, when 
type I, II, and III variations occur, the U point is fxed, and 
the P point moves toward the porta hepatis. Under such 
circumstances, when hilar cholangiocarcinoma requires 
extended right hemihepatectomy, we should isolate the 
trunk of portal vein, right-anterior branch, and left branch, 
respectively. We resect the right-anterior branch of portal 
vein when we have completed protecting the trunk and left 
branch of portal vein. On the other hand, when patients 
undergo extended left hemihepatectomy, we should isolate the left branch and right-anterior branch of the portal 
vein, and then resect the left branch of portal vein when 
we have completed protecting the right-anterior branch of 
portal vein.
Recommendation 16: For patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma, preoperative 3D clinical classifcation and 
evaluation should be performed to guide the selection of 
appropriate surgical methods (A, Strong recommendation).

Diagnosis and treatment of hepatolithiasis 
guided by 3D visualization technology
Hepatectomy guided by 3D visualization is a safe and 
efective method for treatment of hepatolithiasis [61, 62]. 
In the 3D reconstructed model, the following aspects can 
be clearly displayed, including the stereoscopic morphology and mutual relationship of “intrahepatic biliary tree” 
and “vascular tree,” the size and location of stones in the 
hepatic biliary duct, the degree and extent of bile duct stenosis, the distribution of blood vessels, atrophy or hypertrophy of liver, and the presence of atrophy or variation 
[33, 63]. The application of 3DVT in hepatolithiasis is 
demonstrated in Fig. 5. Therefore, in clinical diagnosis, 
we recommend 3D visualized diagnosis and classifcation 
of hepatolithiasis by referring to the stone location (L), 
Table 5 Three-dimensional visualization clinical classifcation for hilar cholangiocarcinoma
Type-I: The tumor invades the common biliary duct, and does not invade the confuence part of the right hepatic duct and left hepatic duct, 
hepatic artery, and portal vein; there is no liver segment or sector atrophy
Type-II: The tumor invades the confuence of right hepatic duct and left hepatic duct, with/without invasion of hepatic artery and/or portal vein, 
without liver segment or sector atrophy
Type-III a: The tumor invades the confuence of right hepatic duct and left hepatic duct, mainly the right hepatic duct, with invasion of right 
hepatic artery or right branch of portal vein, with/without right-sided liver sector and/or liver segment atrophy
Type-III b: The tumor invades the confuence of right hepatic duct and left hepatic duct, mainly the left hepatic duct, with invasion of left hepatic 
artery or left branch of portal vein, with/without left-sided liver sector and/or liver segment atrophy
Type-IV a: The tumor invades the confuence of right hepatic duct and left hepatic duct, the right-sided second-grade biliary duct is involved, 
with right hepatic artery or right branch of portal vein invasion; tumor has not spread beyond the P point, with right-sided liver segment or 
liver sector atrophy
Type-IV b: The tumor invades the confuence of right hepatic duct and left hepatic duct, the left-side second-grade biliary duct is involved, with 
left hepatic artery or left branch of portal vein invasion; the tumor has not spread beyond the U point, with left-sided liver segment or liver 
sector atrophy
Type-V: The extent of tumor invasion spreads beyond bilateral resection limitation points; right and left hepatic arteries, and left branch and 
right branch of portal vein are involved, with/without total liver atrophy
Type-VI: The extent of tumor invasion has not spread beyond the P and U points, with involvement of the hepatic artery or portal vein itself or 
bilateral vessel involvement

biliary stricture (S), biliary dilatation (D), and cirrhosis 
(C) in the clinical digitized diagnosis of hepatolithiasis 
(Fang’s classifcation). For example, hepatolithiasis (LII, 
LVI, LVII, SII, SVI, SVII, DII, DVI, DVII, and C) showed 
stones in segments II, VI, and VII, distal biliary dilatation 
in segments II, VI, VII, and cirrhosis, respectively. However, patients may have hepatolithiasis with or without biliary stricture or biliary dilatation. This digital diagnostic 
classifcation can be rapidly generated after the establishment of 3D reconstructed model, which is conducive to the 
formulation of more reasonable surgical planning [17, 18].
Recommendation 17: 3D visualization should be considered to digital diagnosis and classify hepatolithiasis based 
on the patient’s clinical status to enhance the stereoscopic 
comprehension of calculi distribution and pathological bile 
duct, thereby formulating a more reasonable and radical surgical planning (A, Strong recommendation).
Guidance of digital minimally invasive 
surgery in the treatment of hepatolithiasis
Digital minimally invasive surgery refers to the application 
of digital medical technology such as 3D reconstruction, 
simulation surgery, and intraoperative navigation in surgery 
[64]. As long as there is a biliary stent or a drainage tube, 
3D visualization technology can be used to guide targeted 
lithotripsy through a sinus choledochoscope (soft or hard 
endoscope) to remove residual or recurrent hepatolithiasis; 
the 3D visualization liver model can be used for overall 
observation and targeted puncture to avoid tearing of bile 
duct, injury of hepatic vein, and portal vein [65, 66]. For 
the elderly or patients with suppurative cholangitis and with 
physical conditions not allowing the patients to tolerate complex surgical treatment, percutaneous transhepatic choledocholithiasis lithotripsy and stone extraction should be performed under the guidance of 3D visualization technology.
Recommendation 18: Percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopic lithotripsy (soft or hard endoscope) guided 
by 3D visualization technology should be considered to 
formulate more reasonable surgical planning (A, Strong 
recommendation).
Diagnosis and management of portal 
hypertension with 3D visualization
Portal hypertension refers to a clinical syndrome caused by 
persistent elevation of portal venous pressure. It can be the 
consequence of liver cirrhosis [67]. HVPG measurement 
is an internationally recommended gold standard to evaluate the severity of portal hypertension with good repeatability and accuracy. Clinically signifcant portal hypertension is defined as an increase in HVPG ≥ 10 mmHg 
(1 mmHg=0.133 kpa) [68]. It is still difcult to have a 
dynamic monitoring of clinical outcomes, because HVPG

measurement is invasive and costly [69]. At present, a novel 
non-invasive method for diagnosing portal pressure based 
on a 3D model combined with computational fuid dynamics (CFD) analysis has been preliminarily applied in clinical practice [10, 70]. In a prospective multicenter study, 
virtual HVPG based on CT angiography was developed by 
3D reconstruction of portal vein models and CFD analysis, 
and its performance in the non-invasive diagnosis of portal 
hypertension in cirrhosis was verifed. The results demonstrated that virtual HVPG and invasive HVPG showed a signifcant consistency [71]. The 3D reconstruction of hepatic 
vascular system based on contrast-enhanced CT can provide a basis for puncture path planning in establishing a 
transjugular intrahepatic portal vein shunt (TIPS) [72]. A 
retrospective study reported the feasibility and efcacy of 
real-time 3D CT image guidance in the TIPS procedure, 
which could shorten operation time and reduced radiation 
exposure time. However, the efectiveness of this method 
needs to be further verifed [73].
Recommendation 19: For patients requiring non-invasive 
or dynamic monitoring of HVPG, it is suggested to perform 
virtual HVPG to reduce the invasiveness of the procedures if 
the hospital has an appropriate post-processing workstation 
(B, Weak recommendation).
Recommendation 20: For patients requiring TIPS, individualized 3D reconstruction is recommended to guide 
selection of the puncture route (B, Weak recommendation)
Living donor liver transplantation guided 
by 3D visualization
Liver transplantation provides an opportunity for defnitive 
treatment for end-stage liver diseases. Living donor liver 
transplantation (LDLT) has developed rapidly worldwide 
due to the lack of cadaveric donor livers. The advantages 
of LDLT include optimized transplant timing, better organ 
quality, and lower recipient mortality [74, 75]. For LDLT, 
it is particularly important to clearly understand the volume 
matching of the graft, as well as the variations in the donor 
and recipient liver vascular systems. Therefore, accurate 
preoperative assessment of the donor and recipient liver 
anatomy is the key factor to the success of the operation and 
to guarantee the safety of the donor and recipient. In LDLT, 
3D reconstruction can accurately and efectively evaluate 
the liver vascular systems, liver sizes, and volumes of both 
donor and recipient; simulation surgery allows better resection level selection, vascular processing, and reconstruction 
of donor liver [8, 76–78]; virtual hepatectomy can improve 
the success rate of transplantation by optimizing the choice 
of donor, the decision of venous reconstruction, as well as 
balancing the situation between the recipient and the donor 
[79]. The evaluation of bile duct system based on MRI also 
has important application value in living donor liver transplantation [80]. Venous congestion after LDLT can lead 
to graft and residual liver failure. Three-dimensional CT 
reconstruction has been applied to identify the anatomical 
structure of the hepatic vein with a high risk of graft hyperemia by describing the "regional attribution" of the middle 
hepatic vein; the liver tissues in the drainage area of the 
middle hepatic vein can be protected by including the middle hepatic vein in the transplantation graft or reconstructing the vascular drainage [8, 81]. In LDLT for infants or 
neonates with a limited abdominal space, it is often necessary to reduce the volume of the graft in a complex manner 
to maintain the necessary vascular structures. Surgeons can 
simulate donor surgery through 3D images and 3D printed 
physical models; moreover, the 3D printed model provides 
a realistic sense of the size, vascular anatomy, and thickness 
of the reduced graft [52, 78, 82].
Recommendation 21: It is recommended that 3D reconstruction should be performed before LDLT to assess 
whether there are any variations in the hepatic vascular system in the donor and recipient, and to calculate the size and 
volume of the graft (A, Strong recommendation).
Recommendation 22: It is suggested that the selection of 
donor liver resection plane and simulation of the recipient 
vascular system reconstruction should be carried out through 
3D visual simulation surgery to improve the success rate of 
transplantation (A, Strong recommendation).
Conclusion
The development of digital intelligent diagnostic and treatment technology has promoted liver surgery from the era of 
digital anatomy to a new era of digital intelligent diagnostic 
and treatment [1]. In this consensus, we express our broad and 
bold vision on the application of 3D visualization technology 
in liver diseases. At present, digitalized 3D reconstruction and 
visualized preoperative planning have played an irreplaceable 
role in liver surgery. We envision that in the reasonably near 
future, 3D visualization technology will become a routine 
for the diagnosis and treatment of liver diseases. Standardized 3D visualization processing will eventually make more 
personalized medical services possible. For this vision to be 
updated within the routine clinical setting, MDT led by clinicians should be incentivized to participate in this process. 
Furthermore, standardization is crucial to the success of this 
endeavor, mainly in the acquisition of high-quality data and 
3D reconstruction. Homogenization and standardization are 
the basis of peer review and clinical practice. At the same 
time, the design and validation of standardized clinical trial 
protocols are equally important. These key steps form the 
foundation for the success of liver 3D visualization technology, which can lead to the routinization of this technology.
