Abstract
Background: Although surgery is the definitive curative treatment for biliary tract cancer (BTC), outcomes after
surgery alone have not been satisfactory. Adjuvant therapy with S-1 may improve survival in patients with BTC. This
study examined the safety and efficacy of 1 year adjuvant S-1 therapy for BTC in a multi-institutional trial.
Methods: The inclusion criteria were as follows: histologically proven BTC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status 0 or 1, R0 or R1 surgery performed, cancer classified as Stage IB to III. Within 10 weeks
post-surgery, a 42-day cycle of treatment with S-1 (80 mg/m2
/day orally twice daily on days 1–28 of each cycle) was
initiated and continued up to 1 year post surgery. The primary endpoint was adjuvant therapy completion rate. The
secondary endpoints were toxicities, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS).
Results: Forty-six patients met the inclusion criteria of whom 19 had extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, 10 had
gallbladder carcinoma, 9 had ampullary carcinoma, and 8 had intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Overall, 25 patients
completed adjuvant chemotherapy, with a 54.3% completion rate while the completion rate without recurrence
during the 1 year administration was 62.5%. Seven patients (15%) experienced adverse events (grade 3/4). The
median number of courses administered was 7.5. Thirteen patients needed dose reduction or temporary therapy
withdrawal. OS and DFS rates at 1/2 years were 91.2/80.0% and 84.3/77.2%, respectively. Among patients who were
administered more than 3 courses of S-1, only one patient discontinued because of adverse events.

Background
Biliary tract cancer (BTC) includes intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, perihilar cholangiocarcinoma, distal cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder carcinoma, and ampulla of
Vater carcinoma. BTC is well-known as one of the most
dismal prognostic malignant diseases and its incidence
has been increasing [1–3]. Although surgical resection
may provide curative treatment, the risk of recurrence is
quite high and the reported prognosis of patients with
resected advanced BTC is relatively low [4, 5]. Therefore,
development of effective perioperative adjuvant therapy
is currently being investigated. A meta-analysis series
has shown the potential benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy, especially for patients with node-positive resected
biliary tract cancer [6]. Despite the potential benefits, no
prior randomized control trial (RCT) proved the positive
effect of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy in patients
with BTC [7, 8]. Recently, a RCT assessing a 6-month
administration of capecitabine for adjuvant therapy for
BTC demonstrated improvements in survival [9]; however,
the optimal adjuvant chemotherapy regimen for resected
BTC has not yet been standardized.
S-1 is well-known as an oral anticancer drug consisting of tegafur, 5-chloro-2, 4-dihydroxypyridine and
potassium oxonate. S-1 has already been established as a
standardized adjuvant therapy for patients with gastric
and pancreatic cancer [10, 11]. Regarding BTC, a phase
II trial evaluating unresectable and recurrent cholangiocarcinoma indicated that S-1 had a 35% response rate,
and adverse events were also relatively controlled [12].
One prospective phase II trial comparing the efficacy of
6-month administration of S-1 and gemcitabine for adjuvant therapy after curative resection of BTC also showed
better prognosis in the S-1 group [13]. Moreover, in Japan,
the efficacy of 6-month administration of S-1 for postoperative BTC is currently being investigated in the large-scale
phase III ASCOT trial [14]. Thus, S-1 is expected to
become a standard treatment in adjuvant therapy for
resected BTC.
However, the duration of administration was not
verified. One non-inferiority study comparing 1-year
administration of S-1 with 6-month administration of S1 for adjuvant therapy of resected gastric cancer was
performed; eventually the study was censored because
the 1-year administration group had significantly better
prognosis in the interim analysis [15]. 1-year administration
is still the standard for the treatment of gastric cancer.
Therefore, we hypothesized that 1-year administration of S-1
would improve the prognosis, more than 6-month administration for resected BTC. Although the pilot ASCOT trial
showed a high completion rate (75.8%) with 6-month administration of S-1 for BTC adjuvant therapy [16], there has been
no conclusive evidence on the feasibility of 1-year administration of S-1. Thus, we planned a phase 2 study to investigate the feasibility of 1-year administration of S-1.
Methods

Patients who underwent radical surgery for BTC and
who were diagnosed pathologically were eligible if they
met the following inclusion criteria: those with BTCs
classified into either intrahepatic, hilar/perihilar, or
extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder cancer, or
ampullary of Vater carcinomas according to the WHO

organ dysfunction (such as heart failure, renal failure,
liver failure, intestinal paralysis, uncontrollable diabetes
mellitus); presence of pulmonary fibrosis or interstitial
pneumonitis; presence of severe mental disorder; presence of severe drug allergy; transfusion within 14 days
before registration; women who were pregnant or nursing;
women who may have been pregnant or were willing/trying to get pregnant; and unsuitable candidates for this
study as judged by the physician.
Study design (single-arm, non-randomized, open,
historical control)
This study was designed by the Keio Surgery Research Network (KSRN) and was conducted at the Keio University
Hospital. This study was registered with University Hospital
Medical Information Network (UMIN) center (unique trial
number: UMIN000009029). Patient registration and data
management were conducted at an independent center at
Keio University School of Medicine. All laboratory tests
required to assess eligibility were completed within 28 days
before the start of protocol treatment.
Treatment schedule
S-1 (tegafur, gimeracil, oteracil potassium; Taiho Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) was administered within 10 weeks
after the surgery. An oral dose of 80 mg/m2 S-1 was given
every day on days 1 to 28 of a 6-week cycle for a year. The
total dose was based on the patient’s body surface area as
follows: < 1.25 m2
, 80 mg; 1.25–1.5 m2, 100 mg; > 1.5 m2,
120 mg. After a-year of chemotherapy, additional chemotherapy was not given unless the patient was diagnosed
with recurrence.
The protocol permitted dose modifications and cycle
interruptions were as follows: white blood cells < 2000/
mm3
, neutrophils < 1000/mm3, platelet < 75,000/mm3,
hemoglobin < 8.0 g/dL, adequate liver function (AST >
150 IU/L, ALT > 150 IU/L), serum total bilirubin > 3.0
mg/dL, serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL, and adverse events
associated with gastrointestinal symptom ≥ Grade 3. In
cases for which the S-1 dose was reduced, the dose was
decreased by 20 mg/body weight while maintaining a
minimum dose of 60 mg/body weight, and it was not subsequently increased for any reason. When dose interruptions were prolonged for longer than 4 weeks or if dose
reductions below 60 mg/m2 were required, the patient was
considered for medication discontinuation. Patients had
the option to withdraw from the trial or during follow-up
at any stage. Furthermore, criteria for treatment discontinuation included factors such as the physician’s decision,
recurrence, and development of other cancers.
Follow up after surgery
Postoperative follow-up CT scanning were performed at
3, 6, 12 months for the first year and every 6 months
following that. Tumor marker tests were conducted
every 3 months for 2 years.
Evaluation of toxicity
Toxicity was categorized according to the Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0.
Toxicity was recorded during treatment continuously.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was completion rate at 1 year after
first administration of S-1. Secondary outcomes included
relative dose intensity (RDI), toxicity, overall survival
rate, and disease-free survival rate at 2 years, which was
defined as the time from registration until the event.
RDI was defined as the proportion of actual dose intensity received to the planned dose intensity.
The expected treatment completion rate was set at
50% based on the data of the ACTS-GC trial, of which
completion rate was 65.8% [10]. It was expected that the
completion rate would be lower after major hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgeries than after gastric cancer
surgery due to increased adverse events and recurrence.
The sample size was calculated as 43 patients with a
95% confidence interval for the completion rate of treatment within 30%. Therefore, the target number of
patients was set to be 50 for possible ineligible patients.
Statistical analyses
Data are presented as median (range) or number of patients (%). Intergroup comparisons were performed
using the Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square test for
continuous and categorical variables, respectively. To
identify risk factors for early discontinuation (defined as
discontinuation within 2 courses), we performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Variables with P values < 0.10 in the univariate analysis were
included in the multivariate logistic regression analysis.
P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The SPSS
25.0 statistical software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)
was used to perform all the statistical calculations.
Results
Patient characteristics
Between June 2011 and December 2014, 50 patients were
enrolled in this study. A total of 46 patients were eligible;
patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The
median age was 68.5 years (range, 39–84 years). Nineteen
(41%) patients had extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, 8
(17%) patients had intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, 10
(22%) had gallbladder carcinoma and 9 (20%) had ampulla
of Vater carcinoma. Surgical procedures consisted of 25

(54%) pancreatoduodenectomies, 6 (13%) hepatectomies
without bile duct resection, 6 (13%) hepatectomies with
bile duct resection, and 9 (20%) extended cholecystectomies. Forty-three (94%) patients achieved R0 resection
and 20 (46%) had regional lymph node metastases.
Feasibility analysis (Tables 2, 3, Supplementary Table 1)
Table 2 shows the main results. The completion rate for
all patients was 54.3% while the completion rate without
recurrence during the 1 year administration was 62.5%.
The median relative dose intensity was 62.9%. Of 25
patients with completion, 13 needed dose reduction or
temporary therapy withdrawal, 13 patients withdrew
from S-1 administration owing to adverse events and 8
of these discontinued cases were due to gastrointestinal
adverse events. The reason for discontinuation is summarized in Table 3. Nine cases discontinued because of
adverse events at the first course and 3 cases discontinued at the second course. Only one case withdrew after
receiving 2 courses due to adverse events. We analyzed
the risk factors for early discontinuation, which was defined as discontinuation within 2 courses due to adverse
events (Supplementary Table 1). We divided the patients
into two groups: the early discontinuation group (n = 12)
and the remaining patients (n = 34). Multivariate analysis
identified the age of patients (≥ 69 years old) as an independent risk factor of early discontinuation (HR: 6.5,
95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2–40.0, P = 0.03).
Completion rate by primary disease and surgical
procedures (Table 4)
Completion rate for all patients and those without recurrence based on their primary disease and surgical
procedures are shown in Table 4. The completion
rate excluding recurrent cases ranged from 60.0 to
66.7% by the type of surgical procedures.
Adverse events (Table 5)
Adverse events are shown in Table 5. In total, 41 (89%) patients suffered adverse events (any grade). Hematological
events were most common in all grade adverse events. Overall, 7 (15%) patients suffered severe adverse events at grade 3
or more. Gastrointestinal events such as anorexia or diarrhea
were more frequent than hematologic events or other events.

Long-term outcome (Fig. 1)
The median follow-up time for all patients in this study
was 38.4 months (range, 7.5–56.8 months). The 2-year OS
and DFS were 80.0% (95% CI, 68.2–91.8%) and 77.2%
(95% CI, 64.7–89.7%) and, respectively (Fig. 1). Eight
(60%) of 14 patients who had recurrence in this study
period developed recurrence in the liver. The other recurrence sites were as follows: lymph nodes, 5; lung, 3; local
recurrence, 2; peritoneal dissemination, 2 and bone, 2.
Discussion
In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of adjuvant
chemotherapy by assessing the outcomes of 1-year
administration of S-1 for resected BTC. Our prospective
phase II study demonstrated that a completion rate
without recurrence during the 1-year administration of
S-1 was over 60% and the rate was 50% or more
regardless of the surgical procedures or primary disease.
The most frequent reason for withdrawal was gastrointestinal adverse events occurring early in the treatment
course.
The completion rate in this study was 54.3% (when
recurrence cases were excluded, the rate was 62.5%).
Previous reports regarding adjuvant chemotherapy for
resected gastric cancer showed that 1-year administration of S-1 was tolerable in 48.6–65.8% of patients (in
those without recurrence, 60.7–69.1%) [10, 19]. Several
studies have evaluated the 6-month administration of S1 in BTC. One reported the completion rate was 51.4%
(the rate for those without recurrence was not available)
for BTC after major hepatectomy [13] and the other
reported a complete rate of 75.8% (the rate for those
without recurrence, 86.0%) [16]. Regarding other types
of cancer, a 6-month administration of S-1 was completed in 76.5% of cases (rate for non-recurrence, not

without recurrence, 75.8%) in pancreatic cancer [11].
Compared to other regimens for BTC, the BILCAP trial
that evaluated a 6-month administration of capecitabine
and the BCAT trial that evaluated a 6-month administration of gemcitabine showed the complete rates were
54.7 and 52.1%, respectively [9, 21]. In the current study,
65.2% (those without recurrence, 70.0%) completed a
four-course administration (data were not shown), which
seems to be almost acceptable and comparable with
other cancers or other regimens.
This study showed a higher incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events compared to that of the phase II
trials for unresectable or recurrent BTC [12] and a high

incidence of early discontinuation, especially among
elderly patients. Specifically, there were several patients
who had their medication discontinued due to refusal
following grade 1 or 2 gastrointestinal adverse reactions.
The abovementioned findings could be attributed to the
influence of surgery. Most of the curative surgeries
performed for BTC were extremely invasive with extensive lymph node dissections and upper-gastrointestinal
reconstructions such as pancreatoduodenectomy or
major hepatectomy with extra bile duct resection.
Similar data were reported after gastrectomy or major
hepatectomy [19] [13]. In a recent study, older age and
prescription by surgeons were reported as risk factors
for S-1 discontinuation in gastric cancer [22]. In this
study, S-1 was administered by surgeons, which might
have caused early discontinuation due to insufficient
dose modification or medication for adverse events.
Another recent prospective study demonstrated that the
completion rate of adjuvant therapy increased with combining Kampo for appetite increase [23]. This result
showed the importance of control or prevention of
gastrointestinal symptoms in patients who have undergone upper abdominal surgery. Therefore, we suggest
prophylactic treatment for gastrointestinal symptoms for
older patients or prescription by oncologists to avoid
early discontinuation. However, it should be noted only
one patient discontinued treatment due to a gastrointestinal adverse event after the second course. These results
suggest 1-year administration may be tolerable for
patients who can receive administration for 6 months.
The ASCOT trial is evaluating the efficacy of 6-
month administration of S-1 postoperatively for patients with bile duct cancer [14]. However, the duration
was decided according to the adjuvant therapy regimen
for pancreatic cancer [11]. There was no evidence regarding the duration of administration. Rather, in a
non-inferiority study comparing the 1-year administration of S-1 with a 6-month administration for gastric
cancer, the 1-year administration group had better
prognosis in the interim analysis. Thus, 1-year administration is still the standard for gastric cancer treatment
[15]. Our study showed nearly 80% of 2-year recurrentfree survival. This result seems promising, although this
cohort included more than 40% of patients with positive lymph nodes, which is a common poor prognostic
factor in BTC as referred to in Japanese registry data or
other clinical trials [4, 9, 13, 16]. Because our results
about feasibility and prognosis were acceptable, we
started a prospective randomized controlled trial in
2018 to evaluate the efficacy of 1-year administration of
S-1 as adjuvant chemotherapy by comparing that of 6-
months administration of S-1 (TOSBIC-03 trial UMIN:
000029421) for adjuvant therapy of BTC. We are
expecting that this study will show a significant survival
benefit for 1-year administration with high completion
rate and that the 1-year administration of S-1 could be
one of the standard treatments after curative surgery
for BTC.
Conclusion
The 1-year administration of adjuvant S-1 therapy for
resected BTC was feasible. This regimen has a potential
to become a promising treatment for resected BTC.
