Abstract
Hyperacute rejection is a rare but potentially catastrophic complication after cardiac transplantation. We describe an
unusual case of hyperacute rejection due to preformed anti-donor antibodies despite a negative preoperative
panel-reactive antibody (PRA) screen. An excellent outcome was achieved in this case and our strategy involving
the use of CentriMag ventricular assist devices (VADs) for biventricular support during treatment with rituximab,
intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and plasmapheresis is illustrated.

Background
Hyperacute rejection (HAR) is a rare but dreaded complication following orthotopic heart transplantation with
an approximate mortality rate of 70% [1,2]. It is mediated by preformed anti-donor antibodies and is characterized by complement deposition with widespread
hemorrhage and thrombosis within the allograft [2]. In
the modern era, HAR has largely been avoided by ensuring ABO compatibility between donor and recipient, and
is restricted to cases in which preformed anti-HLA antibodies initiate antibody-mediated rejection [1]. To avoid
this complication, panel-reactive antibody (PRA) screening is used to determine the presence of circulating antibodies to a random panel of donor lymphocytes. Along
a continuum, a higher PRA is associated with worse rejection rates and poorer overall survival [3]. However, in
spite of the recent advancements in PRA screening
techniques, HAR can be occasionally encountered in the
setting of a negative preoperative PRA. Fortunately, the
incidence of such events is low, because the management
of HAR after cardiac transplantation can be extremely
challenging.
In instances of primary graft failure associated with
HAR, temporary circulatory support with extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation and intra-aortic balloon pump
placement has been previously employed [2]. Further,
immunologic strategies for eliminating circulating alloantibodies implicated in HAR include intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody
(rituximab), and plasmapheresis [2,4]. Here, we describe
an unusual case of antibody-mediated HAR in a patient
with a negative preoperative PRA. We also describe a
successful strategy for allograft rescue utilizing biventricular
CentriMag VAD support during targeted immunotherapy
that resulted in an excellent outcome.
Case presentation
A twenty-four year-old African American patient with
non-ischemic cardiomyopathy underwent Heartmate II
left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement and tricuspid valve repair. No blood products were transfused
at the time of LVAD placement. Approximately one year
later, the patient developed a driveline infection and was
listed for transplantation. Two months prior to transplantation, the patient required a blood transfusion. PRA

screen was negative (0%) nine days after transfusion.
Subsequent PRA seventeen days after transfusion was
also negative (0%).
A donor heart of a compatible blood type (ABO class B)
became available. The patient underwent redo-sternotomy,
LVAD explantation, and bicaval orthotopic heart transplant
using standard techniques with an ischemic time of 217 -
minutes. The heart failed to develop a spontaneous rhythm
and severe biventricular failure developed. After two hours
of reperfusion, cardiac function deteriorated further despite
pharmacologic inotropic support and IABP placement.
The heart was discolored and edematous with multiple petechiae. A CentriMag VAD was used to support the left
heart with cannulation via the left atrium, left ventricle,
and aorta. Another CentriMag VAD was used to support
the right ventricle with cannulation via the right atrium
and pulmonary artery (Figure 1A). All cannulas were
brought out of the chest through intercostal or subcostal
incisions, allowing closure of the sternotomy (Figure 1B).
A postoperative retrospective crossmatch was positive.
Treatment with rituximab, IVIG, and plasmapheresis
was initiated in addition to a traditional regimen consisting
of steroids, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus. Serial
echocardiograms revealed improvement in ventricular
function, ultimately demonstrating complete functional recovery (Figure 2). On post-operative day (POD) six, the

patient was noted to have an acute increase in chest tube
output and was taken back to the operating room for
bleeding. However, at re-exploration, there was no evidence of ongoing bleeding. The graft demonstrated excellent biventricular function by both TEE and visual
inspection. The patient was resuscitated overnight and the
VADs were removed on POD seven. The immunotherapy
regimen continued until POD twenty-four. Subsequent
antibody screens demonstrated reduced reactivity to antidonor antigen. Complete recovery of ventricular function
was achieved and the patient was ultimately discharged to
home forty-three days after transplantation.
Conclusions
Risk factors for HAR in cardiac transplantation include
high PRA, positive pre- or post-transplant crossmatch,
induction therapy with OKT3, malignancy, and preceding infection [2]. Additionally, there is emerging evidence that VAD implantation can contribute to HLA
sensitization by inducing secondary T-cell activation and
B-cell reactivity, thereby increasing the risk for antibodymediated rejection [3]. However, even VAD-bridged patients who are preoperatively identified as being highly
sensitized may be candidates for cardiac transplantation.
Lick et al. recently demonstrated that cardiac transplantation of LVAD patients with high PRA without preoperative crossmatch using on-bypass plasmapheresis
and alemtuzumab resulted in equivalent midterm survival compared with non-sensitized patients [5].
PRA screening practices, crossmatch determinations,
and management of sensitized patients vary considerably
among institutions. Moreover, all PRA screening modalities are not created equal. Traditional techniques that
are more commonly used at most institutions include
cell-based complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC)
and anti-human globulin-augmented lymphocytotoxicity
assays [6]. However, newer modalities such as enzymelinked immunosorbent (ELISA) and flow cytometric
(FCM) assays appear to be more sensitive in their ability
to detect class II antigens than the older techniques.
Furthermore, FCM-detectable pre-transplant antibodies
better differentiated sensitized versus non-sensitized patients, and predicted allograft rejection more reliably than
the CDC method [7]. Our institution employs Luminex
single antigen bead assays for HLA antibody screening.
Once antibody-mediated rejection has been identified,
options for treatment include plasmapheresis, immunoadsorption, IVIG, cyclophosphamide administration,
increasing doses of immunosuppression, and rituximab
[2,4]. Rituximab is a chimeric humanized monoclonal
antibody against the pan-B cell surface molecule CD20
that has showed promise in treating antibody-mediated
rejection in cardiac transplantation as well as inadvertent
ABO-incompatible lung transplantation [4]. Although
rituximab induces a rapid depletion of CD20-expressing
B cells in peripheral blood, it has little or no effect on
circulating antibodies. Therefore, several reports have
advocated for complementing the use of rituximab with
modalities that deplete circulating antibodies such as
plasmapheresis, IVIG, or immunoadsorption. Other treatment options reported in the literature include cyclophosphamide, OKT3, and anti-thymocyte globulin [4]. In our
patient, the use of IVIG and plasmapheresis as an adjunct
to rituximab resulted in an excellent outcome.
In addition to the use of appropriate immunotherapy
targeting antibody-mediated rejection, the employment
of biventricular CentriMag VAD support was critical in
achieving complete functional recovery in this case. The
cannulation strategy employed here allowed optimal decompression of both left and right sides of the heart during recovery. In particular, cannulating the left side of
the heart through both the LV apex and the right superior pulmonary vein ensured complete decompression of
the left ventricle. Excellent flows were achieved allowing
ongoing support of organ function. Since heparin was
not used in the early post-operative period, early bleeding complications were avoided. Since the sternum was
able to be closed, infection and sternal wound complications were also avoided in this heavily immunosuppressed patient. Avoidance of early bleeding, preventing
complications of an open sternum, and successful ongoing support of allograft function while the heart was
being rescued allowed for a successful outcome.
