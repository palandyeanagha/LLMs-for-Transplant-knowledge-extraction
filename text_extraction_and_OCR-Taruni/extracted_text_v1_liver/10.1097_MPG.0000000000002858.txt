Abstract
Objectives
To determine quality of life (QoL), stress and anxiety levels in parents of children with biliary 
atresia (BA), and to assess factors associated with parentalQoL.
Methods
Parents of children (6-16 years) with BA were included in this cross-sectional study. We used 
validated questionnaires to assess parental QoL, stress and anxiety levels.We compared the 
results with reference data from the general population and determinedassociated factors using 
generalized linear mixed model analysis. Results are given as mean±SD ormedian [min-max].
Results 
We included 61 parents of 39 children (aged 11±3 years). Thirty-one children (79%) had 
undergone a liver transplantation (LTx). Parents reported reduced family activities (88 [8-100] vs 
95 [30-100], p=0.002) and moreemotional worry (83 [17-100] vs 92 [95-100], 
p<0.001)compared with reference data, buta stronger family cohesion (85 [30-100] vs 60 [30-
100], p=0.05). Scores on parental QoL, anxiety and stress were similar to reference data. Fathers 
(16.0 [11-19])and mothers (15.4±1.4) scored higher on the psychological domaincompared with
reference data (vs 14.7±2.2, p<0.01). There was no significant difference in QoLof parents with 
children with native liver or thosewho had undergone LTx. Older ageand high anxiety trait in 
parentswere adversely associated with physical QoL. Household income below €35.000/year and 
high anxiety trait were adversely associated with environmental QoL.
Conclusions 
QoL in parents of school-aged children with BA appears to be unaffected. Parents with high 
anxiety personality trait, older age and low household income are at increased risk of impaired 
QoL.

Introduction
A chronic disease in children might affect family members and lead to impaired family health.(1)
Several studies reported increased stress levels in parents of children suffering from a chronic 
disease, which is subsequently associated with adverse psychological outcomes in parents, such 
as depression and anxiety.(2–4) These adverse outcomes in parents may also reflect on children, 
for example by leading to disturbed parent-child interactions.(2, 3) In addition, high emotional 
distress in parents of children who underwent a liver transplantation (LTx) has been associated 
with poor adherence to treatment and subsequent poorer health outcomes of the affected child.(5, 
6)
Quality of life (QoL) has been defined by the WHO QoL Group as “an individual’s 
perception of his/her position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which 
he/she lives and in relation to his/her goals, expectations, standards, and concerns.”(7) Previous 
studies have shown a significantly decreased health-related quality of life (HrQoL) in children 
suffering from chronic disease, including children with biliary atresia (BA).(8–12) It is conceivable 
that BA additionally imposes a negative psychological effect on the patients’ parents. However, 
little is known about the impact of BA in children on the quality of life (QoL) of the parents. 
We aimed to assess the QoL and levels of anxiety and stress in parents of school-aged 
children with BA.We compared the results to a reference population and analyzed which parent 
or child-related factors were associated with parental QoL.

Methods
To contact parents or caregivers, we identified eligible children with BA using the Netherlands 
Study Group on Biliary Atresia Registry (NeSBAR).
(13) Throughout this article we will refer to 
caregivers as ‘parents’. Inclusion criteria for the children were confirmed diagnosis of BA and 
school age at time of parental QoL assessment;for this study defined as 6 to 16 years of age. 
Exclusion criteria were insufficient knowledge of the Dutch language by the parents, or no 
informed consent. Ethical approval was obtained from the UMCG Medical Ethics Committee
(METc 2015/359).
Data collection
We sent invitation letters to all eligible parents, followed by a phone call to further explain the 
goal of this study. After obtaining informed consent, we asked the parents to fill out the 
questionnaires. We used a short questionnaire concerning the demographics of the parents, i.e. 
age, marital status, educational level, work status and income. We classified the educational 
levels in accordance with the International Standard Classification of Education Fields of 
Training and Education (ISCED).(14) We also asked parents to fill out a demographic 
questionnaire for their child, including age and educational level of the child. Information on the 
health status of the child was obtained from the NeSBAR database, and/or the electronic patient 
registry systems. These data included gender, information on LTx and medical history from the 
past year (adverse medical event related to BA). Adverse medical events directly or indirectly 
related to liver disease or LTx included, but were not limited to, cholangitis, gastrointestinal 
hemorrhage, portal hypertension, hepatopulmonary syndrome, post-transplant 
lymphoproliferative disorder, portal vein thrombosis, stenosis of the biliary anastomosis, and 
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. 
To assess parental QoL, we used the shortened version of the World Health Organization 
Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF), which contains 26 items.(15) It assesses four 
domains: physical health (i.e. extent of energy for everyday life, impairments due to pain, 
dependency on medicinal treatment, satisfaction of mobility, sleep, activities of daily living, 
work capacity), psychological health (i.e. extent of positive and negative feelings, relevance of 
life, satisfaction of concentration, appearance, oneself), social relationships (i.e. satisfaction of 

Copyright © ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN. All rights reserved.
personal relationships and social support) and environment (satisfaction of physical safety, 
physical environment, finances, extent of leisure activities, living conditions, access to health, 
social services, mode of transportation, availability of information for everyday life). Two items 
form the overall QoL and general health facet. Higher domain scores indicate a better QoL. 
Psychometric properties and reliability of the WHOQOL-BREF are satisfactory.(15–18)
For parental anxiety, we used the shortened form of the State and Trait Anxiety 
Inventory.(19, 20) This questionnaire assesses a respondent’s anxiety state and personality trait. 
State anxiety is an emotional condition that is characterized by a subjective feeling of 
apprehension and tension, and heightened autonomic nervous system activity. Trait anxiety 
applies to differences in an individual's disposition to respond to stressful events, such as having 
a child with BA, with varying amounts of stress. Higher scores indicate higher anxiety levels or 
tendency to experience anxiety, respectively.(19)We assessed parental stress using the Perceived 
Stress Scale.(21, 22) A higher total score indicates higher levels of experienced stress. The internal 
consistency and psychometric properties of this questionnaire have previously been proven 
adequate.(23)
To identifyfactors associatedwith parental QoL we used the described data on 
demographic information and medical status of the children, in addition torecently published 
data on parent-proxyHrQoL of the children (Child Health Questionnaire).(24, 25)
Reference populations
References values were obtained from either the questionnaire manuals or non-matched 
reference groups of healthy peers.(15, 21, 22) The reference group for the WHOQOL-BREF was 
based on the general Dutch population and consisted of 626 participants (32% men) with a mean 
age of 54±16 years.(15) Data from Dutch reference groups was unavailable for both the Stait and 
Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Perceived Stress Scale. The reference group for the State and 
Trait Anxiety Inventory consisted of 1838 working adults of the United States of America (75% 
men), mean age not reported. The reference group for the Perceived Stress Scale consisted of 
2387 citizens of the United States of America (39% men), mean age not reported. 
Statistical analyses
We excluded subjects for analysis in the case of >20% missing data on questionnaire.(15)In the 
case of non-unique answers, where a participant circled two answer options for one question, we

registered the least extreme answer. Per questionnaire, we calculated domain scores and 
summary or final scores based on instructions from the specific questionnaire manuals.(15, 19, 22, 24)
We reported participant characteristics as number (%), mean ± standard deviation (SD), 
or median [range] depending on the distribution of data. Higher scores represent better outcomes 
for all QoL domains, and worse outcomes for stress and anxiety.We used the one-sample t test 
(for normally distributed data) and the one-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test (for non-normally 
distributed data), to compare outcomes with reference data. Either the independent T test 
(normally distributed data) or Mann-Whitney U test (non-normally distributed data) was used to 
compare outcomes between subgroups, e.g. parents of children with native liver versus LTx. 
Chi-square or Fisher Exact analysis was used to compare proportions. 
Generalized linear mixed model analysis, with family membership as random factor, was 
performed to identifyfactors associated with parental QoL. All variables with a p-value below 
0.2 in univariable analysis, including gender, were included in a multivariable model, with a 
subsequent backward selection procedure.
A p-value <0.05 was considered as nominal significant.We performed multivariable 
analysis on four domains of QoL, including three variables per model, resulting in 12 tested 
variables. With Bonferroni correction, a p-value<0.004 (0.05/12) was considered as statistically 
significant. Data was captured in Redcap(26) and analyzed using IBM SPSS version 23. 
Results 
We included 61 parents of children with BA. Of 22 children, both parents completed the 
questionnaires, and of 17 children only one parent participated.The inclusion processispresented 
in Figure 1. In nine answers from three parents, two answers were given for one question, for 
which we registered the least extreme answer. 
Characteristics of the parents are shown in Table 1. Of all included parents, 32 (53%) had 
a high educational level (versus 41% of Dutch citizens between 25-55 years of age in the Dutch 
population(14); p=0.07), 51 parents (85%) were employed, and 40 parents (71%) had a household 
income of more than €35.000,- per year. The children were on average 11±3 years old and 21 
(54%) were boys. At time of study participation, 31 children (79%) had already undergone a LTx 
and one child was on the waiting list. The children of in- and excluded parents did not

significantly differ regarding gender (resp. 54% versus 54% boys, p=1.00) or percentage of those 
who had undergone a LTx (resp. 77% versus 83%, p=0.75).
The parents of two children (5%) rated the global health of their child as poor, and the 
parents of six children (16%) as fair. The health of the majority of the children (n=22, 63%) was 
rated as similar to one year before, the health of nine children (26%) as improved and of four 
children (11%) as somewhat worse than one year before. None of the parents rated their child’s 
current health to be much worse than one year earlier.
Parental QoL, stress and anxiety levels 
The majority of parents rated their overall QoL as good (n=32, 52%) or very good (n=20, 33%). 
Four parents (7%) of two children rated their overall QoL as poor, and five parents (8%) of four 
children as neither poor nor good. None of the domain scores of parental QoL (physical health, 
psychological health, social relationships and environment), nor parental stress and anxiety 
levels were significantly lower, compared with reference data from the general population (Table 
2). Parents of children with BA scored significantly higher on the psychological domain, 
compared with reference data (fathers 16.0 [11-19] versus 14.7 [range not reported], p=0.01; 
mothers 15.4±1.4 versus 14.7±2.2, p<0.001). Fathers’ trait anxiety was lower when compared 
with reference data (26.0 [20-54] versus 34.9 [range not reported], p=0.02).
Distribution of scores on the Child Health Questionnaire parental impact scales, i.e. 
emotional impact (83 [17-100] with 20% scoring maximum) and time limitations (100 [0-100] 
with 63% scoring maximum), were shifted lower compared with reference data (resp. 92 [25-
100] with 34% scoring maximum, p<0.001; and 100 [0-100] with 71% scoring maximum, 
p<0.001). Scores on the family activities scale were significantly lower (88 [8-100] with 31% 
scoring maximum versus 95 [30-100] with 48% scoring maximum, p=0.002), whereas family 
cohesion was shifted higher compared with reference data (85 [30-100] with 15% scoring 
maximum versus 60 [30-100] with 16% scoring maximum, p=0.05).
Factors associated with QoL
The association between parent- and-child related factors and parental QoL domain scores are 
shown in Table 3. Adjusted for parental gender and intra-familial correlation, physical QoL in 
parents decreased on average8.58 points (95% CI -13.80, -3.35, p=0.002) per increase in parental

age category (i.e. 25 to 40 years, 41 to 55 years and 56 years or older), and 1.13 points (95% CI -
1.45, -0.81], p<0.001) per point increase on anxiety personality trait score. Environmental QoL 
significantly decreased with 7.54 points (95% CI -12.03, -3.05, p=0.001) if household income 
was below €35.000 per year, and 0.80 points (95% CI -1.02, -0.57, p<0.001) per unit increase on 
anxiety personality trait score. There was no significant difference in the QoL of parents with 
children with native liver or children who had undergone LTx. 
Discussion
We aimed to determine the effect of BA in children on QoL of their parents. Our data show that 
parents of school-aged children with BA experience significantly more emotional worry, time 
limitations, and reduced family activities than the general population. However, this does not 
seem to negatively affect the QoL of parents in general. Moreover, neither parental stress nor 
anxiety is increased compared with reference data. Parents of children with BA score higher than 
the general population on the psychological QoL domain and report a stronger family cohesion. 
To our knowledge, studies on general QoL in parents of children with BA are scarce. In 
line with our results, Bowden et al. reported comparable levels of psychological symptoms in 
parents of children with serious liver disease as in the general population.(27) However, Cabizuca 
et al. described, in a systematic review with meta-analysis, that almost one in four parents of 
children with chronic diseasesuffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.(28)In our cohort, parents 
of school-aged children with BA reported comparable stress levels as the general population, 
whereas other studies reported elevated parental distress in parents of LTx recipients.
(29, 
30)Distress in parents is subsequently associated with decreased HrQoL in children, which 
underlines the importance of parental wellbeing as a significant component in the care of 
children with BA.
(5, 31, 32)
We hypothesized that BA would have a negative effect on psychological outcomes in 
parents, but our results did not confirm our hypothesis. The relatively unaffected parental 
outcomes in this study might be a result of their long-term adaption to, and coping with, their 
child having BA. This phenomenon is known as ‘response shift’; a change in an individual’s 
perception of their quality of life, based on their individual experiences.(33) In this context parents 
might report good psychological QoL and strong family cohesion as a result of the intense years 
after their child was diagnosed with BA and everything they have experienced together. 
Moreover, in this study, children had already reached school age and the majority of parents 

Copyright © ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN. All rights reserved.
scored their children as clinically stable, with a similar or even improved health status compared 
to the year before. 
Another aim of our study was to explore factors associated with parental QoL. As 
expected, parental QoL wasadversely associated with perceived stress, anxiety state and the 
tendency to experience anxiety, i.e. anxiety trait. High anxiety personality trait has been 
described as a vulnerable phenotype for stress-induced depression.(34) Although the average trait 
anxiety of the parents in our cohort was not significantly higher compared with reference data 
from the general population, there were several parents with a high anxiety trait. Close 
monitoring of those parents is warranted to evaluate whether intervention is indicated. 
Parental age wasadversely associated with physical QoL. A household income below 
€35.000,- per year was associated with lower environmental QoL. We found no significant 
factors associated with QoL in parents with regard to the medical history of their children. We 
hypothesized that an impaired HrQoLin children might influence the QoL of their parents. 
Parent-proxy HrQoL in children was associated with physical and social QoL in parents;
however, this effect was not statistically significant after multivariable analysis. 
We are aware that our study has some limitations. First of all, as BA is a rare disease, the 
sample size was relatively small. Therefore, our results have to be interpreted with caution. In 
addition, we did not find proper Dutch reference values for the Perceived Stress Scale and State 
and Trait Anxiety Inventory and therefore we used reference values from the United States of 
America. We cannot exclude however, that perceived stress and anxiety in the general 
population differsbetween countries. For example, the prevalence of anxiety is somewhat higher 
in the United States of America (18%), compared to Germany (12%).(35) Therefore, our findings 
might slightly underestimate the levels of anxiety and stress in parents of children with BA from 
the Netherlands.Age- and gender-matched reference groups perhaps might have strengthened our 
results. We were not able to include all parents of children with BA, which might have 
influenced our results, although their children did not differ in terms of gender or history of LTx. 
Also, the results could be influenced to some extent by the demographics of our sample, as the 
socioeconomic status of the families in our cohort appears to be somewhat higher than in the 
average Dutch population. The cross-sectional design of this study limits the course of parental 
wellbeing over time.Finally, only a small proportion of children with BA at school age still had 
their native liver. Therefore, the difference in QoL of parents of children who survived with their 

Copyright © ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN. All rights reserved.
native liver and those who had undergone a LTx should be interpreted cautiously. 
Notwithstanding these limitations, we believe that, in the Netherlands, QoL of parents with 
school-aged children with BA is relatively unaffected. 
In conclusion, our data shows that having a child with BA is associated with increased 
emotional worry in parents, but it does not affect parental QoL in general. Longitudinal studies 
on parental QoL would offer insight in the course of psychosocial symptoms in parents in the 
first years after diagnosis. Special attention is warranted for parents at older age, parents with 
low household income and parents with a high anxiety personality trait who might be at 
increased risk of lower parental QoL.
