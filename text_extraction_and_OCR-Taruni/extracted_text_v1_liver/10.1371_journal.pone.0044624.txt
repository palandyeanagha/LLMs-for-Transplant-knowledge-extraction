Abstract
Introduction: Chronic hepatitis C is the main cause of death in patients with end-stage liver disease. Prognosis depends on
the increase of fibrosis, whose progression is twice as rapid in men as in women. Aim of the study was to evaluate the
effects of reproductive stage on fibrosis severity in women and to compare these findings with age-matched men.
Materials and Methods: A retrospective study of 710 consecutive patients with biopsy-proven chronic hepatitis C was
conducted, using data from a clinical database of two tertiary Italian care centers. Four age-matched groups of men served
as controls. Data about demographics, biochemistry, liver biopsy and ultrasonography were analyzed. Contributing factors
were assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis.
Results: Liver fibrosis was more advanced in the early menopausal than in the fully reproductive (P,0.0001) or
premenopausal (P = 0.042) group. Late menopausal women had higher liver fibrosis compared with the other groups (fully
reproductive, P,0.0001; premenopausal, P = ,0.0001; early menopausal, P = 0.052). Multivariate analyses showed that male
sex was independently associated with more severe fibrosis in the groups corresponding to premenopausal (P = 0.048) and
early menopausal (P = 0.004) but not late menopausal pairs. In women, estradiol/testosterone ratio decreased markedly in
early (vs. reproductive age: P = 0.002 and vs. premenopausal: P,0.0001) and late menopause (vs. reproductive age:
P = 0.001; vs. premenopausal: P,0.0001). In men age-matched with menopausal women, estradiol/testosterone ratio
instead increased (reproductive age group vs. early: P = 0.002 and vs. late M: P = 0.001).
Conclusions: The severity of fibrosis in women worsens in parallel with increasing estrogen deprivation and estradiol/
testosterone ratio decrease. Our data provide evidence why fibrosis progression is discontinuous in women and more linear
and severe in men, in whom aging-associated estradiol/testosterone ratio increase occurs too late to noticeably influence
the inflammatory process leading to fibrosis.

Introduction
Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is the primary cause of death in
patients with end-stage liver disease [1]. Its prognosis depends on
the accumulation of fibrosis over time due to various mechanisms
of tissue damage caused by viral infection, ultimately leading to the
development of cirrhosis and related complications. The development of hepatic fibrosis is most directly correlated with necroinflammation, and several other host and viral factors have been
associated with the rate of fibrosis progression [2], including older
age, alcohol consumption, duration of infection, viral coinfections, steatosis, insulin resistance, and vitamin D deficiency
[3].
Studies of large cohorts of patients with CHC have also found
that high levels of estrogens (as observed during pregnancy) [4] are
associated with decreased inflammatory activity in HCV women
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 September 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 9 | e44624

and that the progression of fibrosis in CHC is twice as rapid in
men as in women [5,6]. This difference has been attributed to the
protective role of estrogens and has been supported by experimental and clinical data. Experimentally, estrogens were shown to
have a relevant fibrosuppressive role in a rat model of
dimethylnitrosamine- or pig-serum-induced liver fibrosis [7,8].
Clinically, Di Martino et al. [9] and Codes et al. [10] showed that
the progression of fibrosis increased significantly in women after
menopause, whereas prolonged periods of hormone replacement
therapy (HRT) were able to maintain this progression at a level
similar to that in premenopausal women. In women, menarche
initiates a long period of estrogen exposure that begins to decline
in the premenopausal period, often leading to undetectable
estrogen levels in early and late menopause. In women with
CHC, this reduction in estrogen levels is accompanied by
consensual fluctuation in the levels of pro-inflammatory [11,12]
and anti-inflammatory [12] cytokines that could interfere with the
course of necro-inflammation and the progression of fibrosis.
Much less is known about this process in men: pro-inflammatory
cytokines do not fluctuate in age subgroups corresponding to
female reproductive stages [11], but it remains unknown whether
a relationship exists with changes in sex hormone balance in men.
Thus, the aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of
differential hormonal exposure on the severity of fibrosis in men
and women: we therefore compared women with CHC in
different reproductive phases (reproductive age, premenopause,
early menopause, late menopause) with four age-matched groups
of men and investigated the correlations between fibrosis and the
respective Estradiol and Testostosterone levels.
Materials and Methods
Between January 2002 and December 2008, 1000 consecutive
patients with CHC were recruited to receive standard antiviral
treatment at the Gastrointestinal and Liver Units of the University
Hospitals of Modena and Bari, Italy. Eligible patients were $18
years of age, had compensated liver disease due to chronic
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (any fibrosis stage, including
compensated cirrhosis), detectable plasma HCV RNA levels, and
had received no previous treatment for hepatitis C. Patients were
excluded if they were co-infected with human immunodeficiency
virus or hepatitis B virus or had any other cause of liver disease,
severe depression or psychiatric disorder, or active substance or
alcohol consumption .20 g/day in the last five years, as evaluated
by a questionnaire. Women who had been using hormone
replacement therapy were not included in the analysis. The
detailed demographic characteristics of this cohort of patients have
been reported previously [11].
Within this cohort, four groups of women were selected
according to reproductive stage:
Group 1: full reproductive age (i.e., regular menses); Group 2:
premenopausal; women included in this group entered menopause
(defined as no menstrual period for 12 consecutive months) within
5 years from enrollment in the study; Group 3: early menopausal
(menopause was present at the time of enrollment for less than 5
years); Group 4: late menopausal (menopause was present at the
time of enrollment for at least 10 years).
Four groups of men contained patients that were pair-matched
by age (1:1) with the female cohort.
This study was approved by the institutional review boards of
the two hospitals and was conducted in accordance with the
provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical
Practice guidelines (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01402583).
Clinical and Laboratory Assessment
All patients had undergone liver biopsy within 1 year before
enrollment. Portal vein diameter (mm) was determined by color
Doppler ultrasonography before liver biopsy. The following data
were collected at the time of liver biopsy: age, sex, weight, height,
and body mass index (BMI); serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), c-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), glucose insulin;
and platelet count. Insulin resistance was determined using the
homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). HCV RNA was quantified by Abbott RealTime HCV assay (Abbott Molecular Inc.,
Des Plaines, IL, USA) and genotyped by INNO-LiPA assay
(Innogenetics, Gent, Belgium). All biopsy specimens were reviewed
and scored according to Ishak et al. [13] by a single pathologist
(LL) who was blinded to the patients’ identities and histories. The
percentage of hepatocytes containing macrovesicular fat was
determined for each 106 field, and steatosis was classified as
absent, mild (,5%), moderate (5–20%), or severe ($20%).
Hormone Assays
Estradiol and testostosterone. Blood samples were obtained from all patients by venipuncture and processed within 2 h
after withdrawal. Serum was stored at –20uC and assayed to
determine estradiol and testosterone levels. Serum samples were
subjected to chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassays
(CMIA) to determine 17b-estradiol and testosterone levels using
commercially available kits and a c4000 Architect system (Abbott
Diagnostic Division, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA).
Estradiol was additionally quantitated using the Abbott Architect
Estradiol Assay 200 (rev. 2004) one-step CMIA. Assay sensitivity
was ,10 pg/mL for estradiol and 50 pg/mL for testosterone. The
intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 5.6% and 4.9%
for estradiol, and 4% and 4.6% for testosterone.
Anti-Mu¨llerian hormone. Serum anti-Mu¨llerian hormone
(AMH) levels were assessed in female patients by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (AMH Gen II ELISA; Beckman Coulter,
Inc., Brea, CA, US). The sensitivity of the assay was 0.08 ng/mL.
Intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were ,5% and
,7%, respectively.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables are summarized as mean (SD) and
categorical variables as frequency (%). Continuous variables
within each group were compared by the nonparametric Mann–
Whitney U-test. Categorical data were compared by the chisquare test. Multiple logistic regression models were used to assess
the relationship between severe fibrosis (Ishak staging $3) and the
demographic, metabolic, and histological characteristics of
patients in the individual groups and in each male–female pair
group. In the statistical models, dependent variables were coded as
1 (present) or 0 (absent).
Regression analyses were performed using PROC LOGISTIC,
PROC REG, and subroutines in SAS (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary,
NC) [14].
Results
The detailed epidemiological, virological, laboratorial, histological, and ultrasonographic results of each male–female pair group
are presented in Tables S1 and S2. Women in each group were
selected according to reproductive status (full reproductive age,
premenopausal, early menopausal, late menopausal), and data
from the female groups were compared with those from agematched male groups (intragroup analysis, Mann-Whitney U test).

Characteristics of Reproductive Status–Stratified Female
Groups
We identified 123 women of full reproductive age [mean (SD),
36.7 (6.9) years; range, 18–45 years], 38 premenopausal women
[mean (SD), 47.6 (1.8) years; range, 46–50 years], 50 women in the
early menopausal stage [mean (SD), 53.8 (3.6) years; range, 47–60
years], and 144 women of late menopausal stage [mean (SD), 62.3
(3.2) years; range, 55–73 years].
The detailed comparison between the various groups is reported
in Tables S3 and S4. Women in the first two cohorts (full
reproductive age, premenopausal) showed similar moderately
severe disease states, as indicated by liver necro-inflammatory
activity (P = 0.42; Table S3) and staging (P = 0.062; Table S3,
Figure 1). No significant difference in mean BMI was observed
between these two groups (P = 0.118). Severe steatosis was more
prevalent in premenopausal women (3/38, 8.0%) than in women
of full reproductive age (4/123, 3.2%) although the difference did
not reach significance (Table S4). The presence of cirrhosis in both
groups at the time of enrollment was negligible.
The comparison of reproductive-aged women (full reproductive
age, premenopausal) with those in early menopause revealed
significant differences in several variables. The estimated duration
of HCV infection was significantly longer in early menopausal
women than in fully reproductive (P,0.0001) or premenopausal
(P = 0.017) women. All indicators of disease severity were
significantly worse in early menopausal women in comparison
with the two reproductive-aged groups (early menopause vs. full
reproductive age: grading, P = 0.020; staging, P,0.0001; early
menopause vs. premenopause: grading, P = 0.014; staging,
P = 0.042; Figure 1, Table S3). BMI did differ significantly among
women in early menopause vs. full reproductive age (P = 0.039)
but not between early menopause vs. premenopausal women
(P = 0.90). A significantly higher percentage of early menopausal
women had cirrhosis compared with reproductive-aged women
(P = 0.039, Table S3).
In the late menopausal group, grading did not differ significantly in comparison with the reproductive-aged and premenopausal groups, but was significantly lower than that in the early
menopausal group (P = 0.004). Staging at the time of liver biopsy
was significantly higher in late menopausal women than in full
reproductive age and premenopausal groups (P,0.0001 for both)
while it was of borderline significance vs. early menopause
(P = 0.052) (Table S3, Figure 1). Accordingly, cirrhosis was more
prevalent in late menopausal women than in fully reproductive
(P = 0.004) or premenopausal (P = 0.026) women; however,
prevalence was not significantly different between late and early
menopausal women (P = 0.25; Table S3). BMI, insulin resistance,
and presence of steatosis did not differ significantly between any
pair of female groups.
Multivariate analysis showed that necro-inflammation (OR:
1.506; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.181–1.922, P = 0.001),
steatosis (0 vs. .20%) (OR: 3.029; CI 1.154–7.951, P = 0.024),
circulating estradiol levels (OR: 0.973, CI 0.947–0.999),
P = 0.041), ALT (OR: 1.011, CI 0.003–1.019, P = 0.009) and
portal vein diameter (OR: 2.644, CI 1.657–4.220, P,0.0001) were
independently associated with the severity of fibrosis (Table 1).
Neither age nor estimated length of HCV infection or estimated
age of acquisition of infection was significantly related with severity
of fibrosis.
Comparison of Reproductive Status–Stratified Female
and Male Groups
The results of the comparison of each male–female group pair
are reported in Table S1. The estimated duration of HCV
infection did not differ significantly between each male–female
group pair. Men in groups paired with the first three female
groups (reproductive age, premenopause, early menopause)
showed remarkably more severe liver disease, as indicated by
mean stage of fibrosis (P,0.0001 for all 3 groups; Table S1 and
Figure 1), but no significant difference in fibrosis was found
between women in the late menopausal group and age-matched
men. Similarly, no significant difference in the presence of
cirrhosis was observed between male–female pairs correlating
with full reproductive age and late menopause, whereas the

chronic hepatitis (Women: triangles; Men: squares). Levels of significance of the intra- and inter-group comparison are reported in the text.

incidence of cirrhosis was significantly lower in the two intermediate groups of women than in age-matched groups of men
(P = 0.003 for both; Table S1). In contrast, no difference in
grading or steatosis was observed between male–female group
pairs.
GGT levels were significantly lower in women than in men in
all group pairs (full reproductive age, P,0.0001; premenopause,
P = 0.001; early menopause, P = 0.007; late menopause, P = 0.017;
Table S1). BMI differed significantly between men and women in
all group pairs except the early menopause pair (full reproductive
age, P,0.0001; premenopause, P = 0.045; late menopause,
P = 0.0012; Table S1).
No difference in the severity of liver necro-inflammation was
observed between men and women in each group pair (Table S1).
Multivariate analysis in the whole male and female cohort,
reported in Table 2, showed that sex (OR: 0.460, CI 0.236–0.896,
P = 0.023), necro-inflammation (OR: 1.401, CI 1.239–1.584,
P,0001), circulating estradiol levels (OR: 0.980, CI 0.962–
0.999, P = 0.040), platelets count (OR: 0.974, 0.967–0.981,
P,0.0001) and portal vein diameter (OR: 1.903, CI 0.539–
2.354, P,0.0001) were independently related with severe fibrosis.
Results of multivariate analysis in the whole cohort, stratified in
the four reproductive subgroups, are reported in Table 3. Male sex
was independently associated with the severity of fibrosis in the
premenopausal [male as reference: odds ratio (OR), 0.074; 95%
confidence interval (CI), 0.007–0.834; P = 0.048] and early
menopausal (OR, 0.037; 95% CI, 0.004–0.344; P = 0.004) group
pairs, but not in the reproductive-aged or late menopausal group
pairs (Table 3).
Hormone Assays
Serum concentrations of AMH in the four female groups are
shown in Figure 2. Mean values were 2.4 (1.8) ng/mL in
reproductive-aged women and 0.5 (0.3) ng/mL in premenopausal

women (Mann–Whitney U-test, P,0.0001). AMH levels were
undetectable in early and late menopausal women.
Serum concentrations of estradiol and testosterone in the four
group pairs are shown in Figures 3A and 3B, respectively, and the
estradiol/testosterone ratio [E2/T; estradiol (pg/mL)/testosterone
(ng/mL)] is reported in Figure 3C. Estradiol concentrations
changed significantly in both men and women with age, with a
marked difference observed in both sexes at the age corresponding
to female menopausal onset. In particular, estradiol levels were
significantly higher in reproductive-aged and premenopausal
women than in early (reproductive age: P,0.0001; premenopausal: P,0.0001) and late menopausal women (reproductive age:
P,0.0001; premenopausal: P,0.0001), whereas males exhibited a
significant change in the opposite direction at corresponding ages
(reproductive vs. early menopause: P = 0.003, vs. late menopause:
P = 0.05; premenopausal groups vs. early: P = 0.001, vs. late
P = 0.005). Testosterone levels changed significantly only in
women, who showed significantly higher levels in the full
reproductive age group than in the other groups (reproductive
vs. premenopausal P = 0.44; vs. early menopausal P = 0.006; vs.
late menopausal P = 0.013). Although a decline in testosterone
levels was observed in the two older groups of men, this difference
was not significant. The E2/T ratio changed significantly with age
in both men and women. In women, the E2/T ratio decreased
markedly in early (vs. reproductive age: P = 0.002 and vs.
premenopausal: P,0.0001) and late menopause (vs. reproductive
age: P = 0.001 and vs. premenopausal: P,0.0001). The opposite
change occurred in men (reproductive age group vs. early
menopause group: P = 0.002 and vs. late: P = 0.001) (Figure 3C).
Discussion
In this cross-sectional study comparing a large cohort of women
with CHC who were grouped, according to reproductive status,
with age-matched men with CHC, we found that hormonal phases
were differently associated with the histological severity of liver
disease.
A few clinical studies [8,9] have found that estrogens exert a
beneficial effect on liver disease by slowing the progression of
fibrosis; however, this effect has previously been evaluated in terms
of lifetime exposure, rather than according to different reproductive stages. To overcome this limitation, we divided a cohort of 355
women with CHC into four groups according to reproductive
status. The allocation of patients to these groups was substantiated
using AMH levels, because this glycoprotein is a more accurate
indicator of ovarian reserve than is age or other conventional
serum marker (follicle stimulating hormone, estradiol, inhibin B)
[14–16]. The AMH levels obtained in our study were in
Figure 2. Mean serum levels of anti-mu¨ llerian hormone (AMH) in women divided according to reproductive phases. AMH levels were
significantly lower in premenopausal women in comparison with women in full reproductive age (p,0.0001) and became undetectable in
menopausal women (both early and late).

agreement with those reported for reproductive age, premenopause, and established menopause [17,18], and thus validated the
composition of the four groups.
The results of our study support the concept that the
progression of fibrosis in women is a discontinuous process: very
slow during reproductive age and accelerating rapidly after
menopause. We found that disease severity at the time of liver
biopsy, as measured by the severity of liver necro-inflammation
and fibrosis, was very low in women of reproductive age and in
premenopausal ones while it became higher among early
menopausal women; the severity of fibrosis was found to be even
higher among late menopausal women. Further support for the
protective role of estrogens toward development of fibrosis comes
from the multivariate analysis of risk factors for severe fibrosis:
neither estimated duration of HCV infection nor the age of
acquisition of HCV infection was independently associated with
fibrosis while levels of circulating estradiol was.
The impact of hormonal exposure on fibrosis became even
more complex when the female groups were compared with their
age-matched male counterparts. Although the estimated duration
of HCV infection was similar in all group pairs and age was
equivalent by definition, women had less severe fibrosis than men
in all but the late menopausal group pair. Female sex appeared to
be independently associated with a lower prevalence of severe
fibrosis in the premenopausal and early menopausal group pairs
[19].
These findings may be explained by the observed changes in
hormone levels according to reproductive status. The high
estradiol levels observed in the reproductive-aged groups (full
reproductive, premenopause) likely provided protection against
the development of severe liver injury. However, an independent
correlation between fibrosis and sex was found only in the
premenopausal and early menopausal group pairs, and not in the
fully reproductive group pair. This finding may be due to the short
duration of infection and to the very mild stage of disease present
in both sexes in the reproductive-aged group pair.
In contrast, menopausal women exhibited greater disease
severity than those in the reproductive-aged and premenopausal
group pairs, probably due to the decline in estradiol levels that
occurs rapidly with menopause development. We have already
shown that a marked up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines,
especially interleukin-6 (IL-6), occurs in close temporal relationship with the onset of menopause [11,12], when for the first time
in a woman’s life E2/T ratio dramatically decreases: this is
associated with a sharp increase in necro-inflammatory activity
and is eventually followed (as the change in fibrosis score between
early and menopausal women shows) by a significant increase in
fibrosis in late menopausal women. As the late menopausal malefemale group comparison indicates, at this stage women lose the
advantage that they had in earlier reproductive stages: fibrosis and
percentage of cirrhosis are no longer significantly different from
males and only subtle indicators of disease progression (like portal
vein diameter and platelets count) are still better in females. A
further element that may play a relevant role in reducing
differences in disease severity between genders in the late groups
is the significant increase of estradiol levels and E2/T ratio that
was observed in males of the early and late menopausal groups.
This increase did not result in a change in necro-inflammation, but
was associated with a significant reduction in fibrosis severity in
men in group 4 (group 4 vs. group 3, P = 0.010). This is in
agreement with the recently reported positive correlation between
testosterone levels and increased risk of both advanced hepatic
fibrosis and advanced hepatic inflammatory activity in HCVinfected men [20]: although this study evaluated only absolute
Testosterone levels and not Estradiol or the E2/T ratio, it is
relevant that higher unopposed levels of Testosterone related with
higher severity of disease. In our cohort, the late inversion of the
E2/T ratio in males coincided with the first and only improvement
in fibrosis score in males.
These findings not only reinforce the view that the lengthy
period of exposure to estrogens in women plays a favorable role in
the progression of chronic liver disease in comparison with men,
but also suggest that this protective effect is reversible and strictly
dependent on estrogen levels. When the process of hormonal aging
leads to an inversion in the E2/T balance characteristic of full
reproductive age, women lose the favorable estrogen effect and
show patterns similar to those of men. Accordingly, male sex is
constantly and independently associated with a higher degree of
fibrosis in cohorts whose mean age coincides with the full
reproductive stage (i.e., ,50 years of age) [5,6]. In contrast,

phases as described in Methods. Values (reported as mean6SD) were compared by Mann-Whitney test. The levels of significance are reported in

cohorts with higher mean ages (.50 years; a surrogate indicator of
menopause in women) show similar patterns of fibrosis progression
in men and women, and male sex is no longer a predictor of severe
fibrosis progression [6,21,22].
Although our study was not designed to clarify the pathogenesis
of the association between reproductive phase and the severity of
fibrosis in women, previous studies have provided several
hypotheses. Many experimental data have shown that estradiol
inhibits transforming growth factor (TGF)-b1 expression and
hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation, thereby suppressing the
induction of hepatic fibrosis [8,23,24]. Estradiol is also known to
induce the down-regulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha,
IL-6, and IL-1b [25–27], mediators contributing to hepatic necroinflammation and the activation of HSCs. The favorable role of
estrogens in men has also been suggested by two case reports, in
which different pathological conditions required prolonged estrogen treatment in two young men, one with hepatitis C [28] and
the other with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) [29]. In the
first case, the addition of estradiol reduced disease activity and
maintained viral loads at lower levels than observed before
treatment [28]. In the second case, it reversed hepatic steatosis and
insulin resistance [28].
In this study of a cohort of women with CHC classified by
reproductive phase and compared with age-matched men with
CHC, we found that the severity of fibrosis in women is strictly
related with Estradiol levels and E2/T ratio. Progression of fibrosis
follows the sharp rise of necro-inflammatory activity occurring in
coincidence with estrogen deprivation in early menopause [11].
This finding explains the discontinuous rate of fibrosis progression
in women and the more linear rate observed in men, in whom the
modification of sex hormone balance determined by agingassociated Estradiol increase occurs very late in life and thus
may have only a limited beneficial effect on hepatic condition.
Limitations
The main limitation of this study lies in its cross-sectional
design, which prevented the evaluation of fibrosis progression in
individual patients according to baseline reproductive status and
reproductive transitions. A further methodological question is the
potentially limited external validity of the results for different
populations and settings, because our study included a cohort of
Italian subjects enrolled at a tertiary care center.
