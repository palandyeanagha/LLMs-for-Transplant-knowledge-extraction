Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, a global public health problem can be asymptomatic,
acute or chronic and can lead to serious consequences of infection, including cirrhosis,
and hepatocellular carcinoma. HBV, a partially double stranded DNA virus, belongs
to the family Hepadnaviridae, and replicates via reverse transcription of an RNA
intermediate. This reverse transcription is catalyzed by a virus-encoded polymerase that
lacks proof reading ability, which leads to sequence heterogeneity. HBV is classified
into nine genotypes and at least 35 subgenotypes, which may be characterized by
distinct geographical distributions. This HBV diversification and distinct geographical
distribution has been proposed to be the result of the co-expansion of HBV with
modern humans, after their out-of-Africa migration. HBeAg is a non-particulate protein
of HBV that has immunomodulatory properties as a tolerogen that allows the virus
to establish HBV infection in vivo. During the natural course of infection, there is
seroconversion from a HBeAg-positive phase to a HBeAg-negative, anti-HBe-positive
phase. During this seroconversion, there is loss of tolerance to infection and immune
escape-HBeAg-negative mutants can be selected in response to the host immune
response. The different genotypes and, in some cases, subgenotypes develop different
mutations that can affect HBeAg expression at the transcriptional, translational and
post-translational levels. The ability to develop mutations, affecting HBeAg expression,
can influence the length of the HBeAg-positive phase, which is important in determining
both the mode of transmission and the clinical course of HBV infection. Thus, the
different genotypes/subgenotypes have evolved in such a way that they exhibit different
modes of transmission and clinical manifestation of infection. Loss of HBeAg may
be a sign of short-sighted evolution because there is loss of tolerogenic ability of
HBeAg and HBeAg-negative virions are less transmissible. Depending on their ability
to lead to HBeAg seroconversion, the genotype/subgenotypes exhibit varying degrees

of short-sighted evolution. The “arms race” between HBV and the immune response to
HBeAg is multifaceted and its elucidation intricate, with transmissibility and persistence
being important for the survival of the virus. We attempt to shed some light on this
complex interplay between host and virus.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV), which belongs to the family
Hepadnaviridae is the smallest DNA virus infecting man. HBV
has a partially double-stranded, circular DNA genome of ∼3,200
base pairs, with four overlapping reading frames (ORFs). HBV
replicates via an RNA intermediate, through the process of
reverse transcription catalyzed by the viral polymerase that
lacks proof reading ability. Thus, sequence heterogeneity is
a feature of the virus and within the host HBV exists as a
quasispecies of mixed viral strains. Based on an intergroup
divergence of >7.5% across the complete genome, HBV has
been classified phylogenetically into 9 genotypes, A–I (Norder
et al., 2004; Kramvis et al., 2005; Yu et al., 2010; Kramvis, 2014)
(Figure 1), with a putative 10th genotype, “J,” isolated from a
single individual (Tatematsu et al., 2009). Genotypes A–D, F, H,
and I are classified further into at least 35 subgenotypes, using
between ∼4 and 8% intergroup nucleotide divergence across the
complete genome and good bootstrap support, (Norder et al.,
2004; Kramvis et al., 2005, 2008; Kramvis, 2014). The genotypes,
and in some cases the subgenotypes, have distinct global and local
geographical distributions, with the genotypes, prevailing in the
two regions where HBV is endemic, south East Asia, and Africa,
being different (Figure 2) (Kramvis et al., 2005; Kramvis, 2014).
This HBV diversification and distinct geographical distribution
has been proposed to be the result of the co-expansion of
HBV with modern humans, after their out-of-Africa migration
(Paraskevis et al., 2013).
In addition to encoding for the structural proteins, HBcAg
(core or capsid protein) and the viral envelope proteins [three
forms of HBsAg, small (S), middle (M), and large (L)] and
the polymerase/reverse transcriptase, the compact genome of
HBV encodes for two non-particulate proteins, the X protein
(a transcriptional transactivator) and HBeAg (Tiollais et al.,
1981). Antibodies are directed against both structural and nonstructural proteins of HBV. Anti-HBc is non-neutralizing and a
sign of exposure to HBV. Anti-HBs is the neutralizing antibody,
directed against “a” dominant epitope of the viral envelope and
anti-HBs levels >10 IU/L, following either natural infection or
vaccination, are indicators of immunity. Anti-HBe is directed
against B cell epitopes shared by both HBeAg and HBcAg, with
HBeAg acting as a decoy for HBcAg. HBcAg and HBeAg T cell
epitopes are also cross-reactive in both humans (Ferrari et al.,
1991) and mice (Milich et al., 1987). Anti-HBe seroconversion
can occur up to 6 years before the actual loss of HBeAg or the
onset of liver damage (Thompson et al., 2007).
The complex interplay between the host and viral factors
(including genotype/subgenotype, viral load and HBeAg status)
play an important role in determining the clinical outcomes
of HBV infection. HBV infection can be asymptomatic, acute,
chronic (HBsAg-positive for longer than 6 months), which can
lead to serious consequences of infection, including cirrhosis, and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; liver cancer). HBV is generally
non-cytopathic. The liver damage associated with either acute or
chronic hepatitis B is as a result of the immune response attack
on hepatocytes, in a bid to eliminate HBV during the immune
clearance or reactive phase, which leads to necroinflammation.
In order to overcome the effects of the immune response viruses
can code for immunomodulatory proteins, such as HBeAg in
the case of HBV, and also evolve genetically in order to escape
the immune response. Immune escape mutants can be selected
during the course of natural infection in response to the host
immune response. In HBV the complex patterns of purifying
selection are as a result of the overlapping ORFs (Mizokami
et al., 1997) and the high frequency of recombination (Simmonds
and Midgley, 2005; Zhou and Holmes, 2007). The “arms race”
between HBV and the immune response is multifaceted and its
elucidation intricate, with transmissibility and persistence being
important for the survival of the virus. Here an attempt will be
made to shed some light on this complex interplay.
HBeAG AS AN IMMUNOMODULATOR
The 25 kDa precursor of HBeAg, with an additional 29 amino
acids on its amino terminus relative to HBcAg, is translated from
the preC/C ORF on the precore mRNA [1901–2452/2488 from
the EcoRI site, (Kramvis et al., 2005)] (Summers and Mason,
1982; Messageot et al., 2003). HBcAg is translated from the
pregenomic RNA from position 1901. The basic core promoter
(BCP) of HBV controls the transcription of the preC/C region
from both transcripts (Yuh et al., 1992; Yu and Mertz, 1996)
(reviewed in Kramvis and Kew, 1999). The amino terminal signal
peptide directs the precursor to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
where it is post-translationally modified by cleavage on the amino
and carboxyl termini to give rise to the mature HBeAg that is
expressed in the hepatocyte cytosol and also secreted in its soluble
form in the serum (Revill et al., 2010).
Even though its exact function has not been determined,
the conservation of HBeAg in all hepadnaviruses signifies an
important role of this non-particulate secreted protein (Revill
et al., 2010). Moreover, HBeAg must impart an evolutionary
advantage to HBV because even though HBeAg-negative mutant
strains of HBV exist (see below), they have not replaced the wildtype virus. From various animal studies it is evident that HBeAg is
not involved in viral infection, replication, and assembly (Chang
et al., 1987; Schlicht et al., 1987; Chen et al., 1992; Milich and
Liang, 2003), but is important for natural infection in vivo (Milich
and Liang, 2003). It is thought that the virus has retained the

secretory form of HBcAg because it has immunomodulatory
functions. HBeAg downregulates the immune response to
HBcAg by deletional, nondeletional, central, and peripheral
immune tolerance (Milich et al., 1990, 1998; Milich, 1997;
Milich and Liang, 2003; Chen et al., 2004, 2005). Thus, HBeAgmediated immune regulation may predispose to chronicity and
persistence following in utero or perinatal transmission and
prevent severe liver injury during adult infections (Milich and
Liang, 2003). Clinically, HBeAg is an index of viral replication,
infectivity, inflammation, severity of disease and response to
antiviral therapy.
HBeAg is expressed by both human and non-human
hepadnaviruses, with all mammalian-infecting sequences
showing high conservation within the amino terminus of the
precursor and key immunomodulatory epitopes (Revill et al.,
2010), including B-cell epitopes and T-cell recognition sites in
the region that overlaps with HBcAg (Milich et al., 1987; Belnap
et al., 2003; Billaud et al., 2005). Thus, HBeAg:
• elicits both humoral and cell-mediated immunity,which differ
from that directed to HBcAg (Huang et al., 2006)
HBcAg and HBeAg share extensive amino acid homology but
differ in their structure and localization. HBcAg is particulate and
found in the cell whereas HBeAg is non-particulate/monomeric
and can be found in the cell but is also secreted extracellularly
(Milich and Liang, 2003). Because of these differences they are
targeted by different antibodies (Imai et al., 1982). The antibody
to HBcAg can either be T-cell dependent or independent and the
non-cross-reactive antibody to HBcAg is greater than that to that
directed against HBeAg (Milich and McLachlan, 1986). HBeAg
exhibits low T-cell dependent antibody response (Milich and
Liang, 2003). The CD8+ T-cell (CTL) response against HBcAg
is important in HBV elimination in humans (Bertoletti et al.,
1991; Chisari and Ferrari, 1995). HBcAg and HBeAg are highly
cross-reactive at the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell levels (Milich et al.,
1988; Bertoletti et al., 1991; Kuhrober et al., 1997; Townsend et al.,
1997) and are indistinguishable in terms of CTL priming and
CTL target recognition in vitro (Kuhrober et al., 1997; Townsend
et al., 1997; Frelin et al., 2009). HBeAg expressed in hepatocytes
in vivo is a superior target for HBcAg/HBeAg CTLs compared to
HBcAg alone (Frelin et al., 2009). In order to be recognized by the
CTLs, cytosolic HBeAg and/or its precursors must be processed
and presented in the context of major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) class I molecules (Frelin et al., 2009), whereas HBeAg
presentation for CD4+ cells is via the MHC class II pathway
(Milich and Liang, 2003).
• functions as a T cell tolerogen (Chen et al., 2005) and regulates
the immune response against the intracellular nucleocapsid
(Chen et al., 2004)
An important function of the non-particulate HBeAg, which is
the only HBV protein to cross the placenta (Milich and Liang,
2003), is to establish neonatal T cell tolerance to both HBeAg and
HBcAg (Milich et al., 1990; Hsu et al., 1992; Chen et al., 2004).
Therefore, it is essential that HBeAg remains non-particulate so
that it can cross the placenta (Schodel et al., 1993).
• regulates the innate immune response to viral infection within
hepatocytes.
The adaptive immune response is attenuated, by the preferential
activation of Th2 cells over Th1 cells, following NF-kB activation
by HBeAg (Yang et al., 2006). Th2 cells induce a non-protective
humoral response whereas Th1 cells stimulate macrophages,
which eliminate virions (Forsthuber et al., 1996; Huang et al.,
2006). HBeAg in the serum leads to a switch from the normal
Th1-mediated anti-HBc antibody response to Th2 phenotype
(Milich et al., 1998). The difference in the activation of the
different Th cell subsets is probably because the primary antigenpresenting cells are different for HBcAg and HBeAg, being
B cells for the former and dendritic/macrophage cells for the
latter (Milich et al., 1997) This preferential activation by HBeAg
of Th2 cells, together with the depletion of Th1 cells, which
are required for viral clearance, can lead to the persistence of
HBV. HBeAg also down-regulates the expression of the Toll-like
receptor (TLR) family within hepatocytes (Riordan et al., 2003;
Visvanathan et al., 2007). When peripheral blood monocyte cells,
were pre-treated with HBeAg, they displayed an impaired TLR
signaling response (Visvanathan et al., 2007).
HBeAG TO ANTI-HBe SEROCONVERSION
Broadly, the natural history of HBV can be divided into at
least four phases, which are differentiated by the level of viral
replication and the host immune response:

• The high replicative, low inflammatory phase (previously
immune tolerant phase) (Gish et al., 2015) is HBsAg/HBeAgpositive, with high HBV DNA levels (>2 × 105
IU/ml) (Ni
et al., 2007), with minimal liver inflammation, normal liver
enzyme levels and asymptomatic(Chang et al., 1988). HBV
does not select mutations frequently.
• The immune clearance or reactive phase is characterized
by fluctuating alanine amino transferase (ALT) and HBV
DNA levels and ending with spontaneous HBeAg loss (Ni
et al., 2007; Liaw and Chu, 2009). HBeAg seroconversion is
accompanied by elevated ALT and decreased HBV DNA levels
(Ni et al., 2007). Core and precore mutations emerge in HBV.
• The HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis phase(Gish
et al., 2015), characterized by necroinflammation with
high or fluctuating ALT levels and unsuccessful immune
clearance, moderate to high viral loads and progressive liver
disease.
• The low replicative phase (previously “inactive HBsAgpositive carrier” phase)(Gish et al., 2015) (post-HBeAg
seroconversion). Although like the HBeAg-negative chronic
hepatitis phase, this phase is also characterized by the absence
of HBeAg, anti-HBe positivity, ALT levels are normal and
HBV DNA levels are low or undetectable (<2 × 103IU/ml).
The length of the HBeAg-positive phase is important in
determining both the mode of transmission and the clinical
course of HBV infection. Mother-to-child transmission and
subsequent chronic infection in the infant are favoured when
mothers are HBeAg-positive (Chen et al., 2012), whereas
children born to HBeAg-negative mothers are more likely
to develop acute hepatitis B or may be infected horizontally
later in life, if not immunized (Hadziyannis and Vassilopoulos,
2001; Kramvis, 2016). Following acute HBV infection, the
development of chronic infection requires the expression of
HBeAg (Hadziyannis, 2011) with a longer duration of HBeAgpositivity, increasing the risk of liver disease progression (Chu
and Liaw, 2007). Although HBeAg loss is universally considered
to be a favourable outcome (Hsu et al., 2002; Chu and
Liaw, 2007), usually accompanied by decreased viral load and
clinical remission, active hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular
carcinoma can develop in a minority of patients even after
seroconversion (Hsu et al., 2002).
HBeAg seroconversion is a dynamic process lasting a number
of years and involves the interaction between the host immune
response and changes in the quasispecies and viral loads of HBV
(Lim et al., 2007).
VIRAL EVOLUTION AND EMERGENCE OF
MUTANTS AFFECTING HBeAG
EXPRESSION
The loss of HBeAg between the high replicative, low
inflammatory phase and HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis
phase is accompanied by:
• Decrease in viral sequence diversity
Viral sequence diversity was found to be 2.4-fold higher in
both spontaneous and interferon-induced HBeAg seroconverters
compared with non-seroconverters (Lim et al., 2007). Mutations,
in both the HBeAg and HBcAg, were positively selected in 70%
of the seroconverters compared to 5% of the non-seroconverters
(Lim et al., 2007).

*The logistic regression method was used to identify HBV mutations associated with specific genotypes/ subgenotypes (Afifi et al., 2004). Larger values show tighter correlations, with
positive values related to a positive association, and negative values to a negative association. All associations were statistically significant using 2-sided p-values (Kramvis et al., 2008).
• Increase in viral substitution rates
Viral substitution rates have been shown to increase between
the high replicative, low inflammatory phase and the immune
clearance/reactive phase (Hannoun et al., 2000). Following
seroconversion, immune pressure continues to drive viral
mutagenesis even though the viral loads may be low (Lim et al.,
2007) and HBV replicates less efficiently in the HBeAg-negative
phase of disease (Volz et al., 2007).
• Emergence of HBeAg-negative mutants
The viral quasispecies following seroconversion are defective
in HBeAg production as a result of mutations in the BCP
and preC/C ORF. Mutations in the BCP and preC can
influence the expression of HBeAg at the transcriptional,
translational and post-translational levels (Kramvis, 2016)
(Table 1).
Position 1858 in the preC/C can be either a C or T
(Figure 3) and is differentially associated with the different
genotypes/subgenotypes (Table 1). This variation at position
1858 can influence, which of the mutations, affecting HBeAg
expression, will develop (Kramvis et al., 2008) and their
frequency (Revill et al., 2010).
Although the HBV sequences deposited in the public
databases, such as GenBank, may not be entirely representative
of the strains circulating globally, they provide the best available
datasets of genotyped strains of HBV (Bell et al., 2016). From this
data set it is evident that the genotype can affect the frequency of
the BCP/PC mutations. The BCP double mutation 1762T/1764A
occurs in ∼25% of downloaded sequences (Bell et al., 2016)
without difference between subgenotypes A1, A2, and genotype
D (Figure 3). In two case control studies, independently of
HBeAg status, 1762T/1764A was significantly more frequent in
genotypes A and C compared to D and B, respectively (Orito
et al., 2001; Tanaka et al., 2004). A mutation, which leads to a
stop codon that truncates HBeAg during translation, G1896A,
does not develop in the genotypes/subgenotypes in which 1858C
occurs frequently (Li et al., 1993; Lok et al., 1994) and in
which 1858C is positively associated with, namely, A, C2, F2,
and H (Kramvis et al., 2008). On the other hand, G1896A
is frequent in genotypes/subgenotypes, which have 1858T, C1,
D, E, and F (Kramvis et al., 2008; Revill et al., 2010). As
illustrated in Figure 3 more than 40% of genotype D sequences
downloaded from Genbank had G1896A whereas it was found
in very few genotype A sequences. Overall G1896A occurs
in up to 30% of all sequences, most frequently detected in
genotypes G (100%), and B (50%), followed by genotypes D
(40%) and C (23%) (Revill et al., 2010). All genotype G and
the majority of subgenotype B6 sequences encode this mutation
and it is least frequently observed in genotype A (1.5%) and
genotype F (5%) (Revill et al., 2010). Thus, because of these
differences the estimated annual rate of HBeAg to anti-HBeAg
seroconversion can differ between the genotypes. Genotype B
has higher annual rate of seroconversion of 15.5% compared to
genotype C (7.9%) (Kao et al., 2004) and E (7.4%) (Shimakawa
et al., 2016). In a Taiwanese study, it was shown that HBeAg
seroconversion of patients infected with genotype C occurred
10 years later than those infected with genotype B (Kao et al.,
2004).
Subgenotype A2 does not select the G1896A mutation, nor
the other mutations found in subgenotype A1 that contribute
to the HBeAg-negativity of this unique strain (Table 1). In
particular, the mutations in the Kozak sequence upstream
from the precore start codon (1809–1812), characteristic of
subgenotype A1 (Baptista et al., 1999; Kramvis and Kew, 2007;
Revill et al., 2010), interfere with translation of HBeAg by a
leaky scanning mechanism (Ahn et al., 2003), do not occur in
subgenotype A2. Therefore, generally subgenotype A2 has a high

frequency of HBeAg-positivity compared to subgenotype A1 and
this is statistically significant in individuals younger than 30
years (Tanaka et al., 2004). The reason for the high frequency of
HBeAg-positivity in subgenotype A2 is possibly because the only
mutation that is selected in A2 that can affect HBeAg expression
is 1762T/1764A. This double mutation is found more frequently
in HBeAg-negative carriers of subgenotype A2 HBV, whereas, the
frequency of 1762T/1764A is not affected by HBeAg status in
subgenotype A1 (Tanaka et al., 2004). In genotype D isolates from
HBeAg-negative individuals, both 1762T1764A and 1896A were
more frequent than from HBeAg-positive individuals (Tanaka
et al., 2004). The BCP 1762T/1764A mutations are not selected
in subgenotype B6 strains, prevalent in people living in Canadian
Arctic and who are frequently HBeAg-negative, as a result of
1896A and precore start codon mutations (Osiowy et al., 2011).
Even though genotypes D and E cannot be differentiated in
the precore region and both have 1858T, they do not develop
G1896A at the same frequency. In Sudan, where genotypes
D and E co-circulate viral loads were significantly higher in
genotype E-infected patients compared to genotype D-infected,
with patients infected with genotype E, showing a significantly
higher frequency of HBeAg-positivity in blood donors (Mahgoub
et al., 2011), asymptomatic carriers and liver disease patients
(Yousif et al., 2013). The high frequency of HBeAg-negativity in
genotype D was as a result of G1896A (Mahgoub et al., 2011;
Yousif et al., 2013), which correlates with the statistically positive
and negative association of G1896A, with genotype D and E,
respectively (Kramvis et al., 2008) (Table 1). This is confirmed
by a comparison of the frequency of G1896A in sequences
downloaded from the public databases (Bell et al., 2016), where
G1896A occurred 47.2% of genotype D compared to 34.2%
genotype E sequences (p < 0.0001) (Figure 4). Genotype G is
unique in that all sequences have a premature stop codon at
position 2 of the precore precursor protein and therefore HBeAg
is not expressed (Stuyver et al., 2000).
Subgenotype A1 is the most “sophisticated” in terms of its
control of HBeAg expression (Kramvis and Kew, 2007). Firstly,
like all other genotypes and subgenotype A2, it can develop
1762T/1764A. Secondly, instead of Kozak 1809–1812 GCAC,
which is present in subgenotypes A2 and D3, subgenotype
A1 has TCAT (Kramvis and Kew, 2007). These variations are
characteristic of subgenotype A1 and affect HBeAg expression
at the translational level (Ahn et al., 2003), by converting the
Kozak region from an optimal to a suboptimal translation
context (Kimbi et al., 2004) and, causing decreased translation
of HBeAg by a ribosomal leaky scanning mechanism (Ahn et al.,
2003). Compared to subgenotypes A2 and D3, transfection with
subgenotype A1 led to a lower expression of the precore/core
precursor in the secretory pathway and a higher co-localization
in the nucleus (Bhoola and Kramvis, 2016). This reduction in
HBeAg levels is comparable to that observed in the presence
of 1762T/1764A and when occurring together, the Kozak and
BCP 1762T/1764A mutations reduce HBeAg expression in an
additive manner (Ahn et al., 2003). Thirdly, a G to T transversion
at position 1862 in the precore region of HBV occurs more
frequently in subgenotype A1 isolates from HBeAg-negative
than in HBeAg-positive South Africans (Kramvis et al., 1997,
1998) and affects HBeAg expression at the post-translational
level (Sugauchi et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2008; Inoue et al., 2009;
Bhoola and Kramvis, 2017) This mutation results in a valine
to phenylalanine substitution at the−3 position of the signal
peptide cleavage site at position 19 of the precursor protein.
Phenylalanine interferes with signal peptide cleavage (Nielsen
et al., 1997). This leads to decreased HBeAg expression as a result
of the increased retention of the precursor in the cytoplasm of
the hepatocyte (Chen et al., 2008; Inoue et al., 2009; Bhoola
and Kramvis, 2017). When this mutation was introduced into

a genotype D plasmid driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter, it
resulted in a 54% reduction in the secretion of HBeAg relative to
the wild-type and to the formation of aggresomes (Chen et al.,
2008). When this mutation was introduced into a subgenotype
A1 backbone, the decrease in expression of secreted HBeAg was
less than that in the genotype D context (22%). The mutant
was found to lead to the accumulation of the HBeAg precursor
protein in the ER and ER-Golgi intermediate compartment
(ERGIC). This accumulation resulted in an earlier activation of
the three UPR pathways, but not to an increase in apoptosis
(Bhoola and Kramvis, 2016).
Thus, in the various genotypes and subgenotypes, HBeAg loss,
and immune response escape are as a result of a number of
mutations. In order to survive, HBV has to balance its ability
to establish an infection (HBeAg-positive, immunotolerogenic
phase) and escape the immune response (HBeAg-negative phase)
in order to persist.
INTERACTION OF THE VIRUS AND HOST
Previous studies have shown that a few years before
seroconversion and as soon as the levels of HBeAg begin
declining, the genetic diversity of the virus increases (Hannoun
et al., 2000; Lim et al., 2007; Cheng et al., 2013). Notably viral
diversity does not follow this trend in non-seroconverters
but remains at the low-level seen over the course of the
immunotolerant phase (Lim et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2011; Cheng
et al., 2013). Given the stable rate at which mutations accumulate
in the HBV genome during the different stages of HBV
replication, the differences in viral diversity observed, firstly
between seroconverters and non-seroconverters, during the
course of the infection and close to the time of seroconversion
are because of the strong selective pressure of the immune
response (Cheng et al., 2013). Specifically, as soon as the levels of
HBeAg are decreasing, tolerance diminishes, leading to increased
immune response and the selection of escape variants, which
are infrequently selected during the immunotolerant phase. The
increased genetic diversity is inversely related to HBV-DNA
levels, intimating that the variants selected before and during
the HBeAg negative phase have a lower replicative capacity
than the virions circulating in the absence of immune selective
pressure (Cheng et al., 2013). Thus, the intra-host viral evolution
also follows different stages according to the HBeAg and
immune-status of the host. During the immunotolerant phase,
the virus replicates without constraint from the host and thus
there is no need to select multiple variants; in contrast, during
the immune clearance and seroconversion phase, different
variants are selected because of the strong selective pressure (Lim
et al., 2007; Cheng et al., 2013). Interestingly, during the latter
phase, multiple variants with higher genetic variability in the
non-overlapping genomic regions are selected and circulate.
Therefore, there is a complex interaction of the virus and the
host. As it has been previously found, HBV has co-expanded
with modern humans for at least 28,000 years suggesting a long
period of interaction (Paraskevis et al., 2013). HBV major clades
(genotypes) have been generated as a result of founder effects
of different strains spreading in distinct geographic regions.
Similarly, subgenotypes, belonging within HBV major clades, are
the result of more recent events of strains. The time of the most
common recent origin (tMRCA) of different genotypes has been
previously estimated to occur several 1,000 years ago (Paraskevis
et al., 2013), while the tMRCA of the subgenotypes is more
recent (Paraskevis et al., 2013). Given that HBV has co-expanded
with humans for a long time and also that some genotypes have
been more frequently found in specific areas and populations
(i.e., F/H in indigenous populations in America; B and C in
Asia; many different subgenotypes have been infecting mostly
indigenous populations across the globe) suggests that some
of the genomic characteristics related to the HBeAg expression
probably have been shaped over a long time period. This is
presently a hypothesis and concrete evidence will come from the
analysis of HBV from ancient samples.
Stochastic mutations lead to the break of immune tolerance
and/or increased immune reactivity, which drives viral evolution
from a low- to a high-level positive selection stage that in
turn leads to decreased HBV DNA levels because of increased
immune pressure and less efficient viral replication. This
increased sequence diversity in the intra-host quasispecies in
seroconverters prior to the loss of HBeAg was found to be
Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 7 October 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 2521

Kramvis et al. Immunomodulatory Function of HBeAg
largely as a result of sequence variation in the precore/core
open reading frame and its regulatory elements (Harrison et al.,
2011). This sequence variation in the region encoding HBeAg
can influence the immunomodulatory role of HBeAg, the ability
of HBV to persist and be transmitted, as well as its virulence.
The driving forces of viral evolution during the different stages
of HBV infection are complex and difficult to present in a linear
fashion. The balance and trade-offs of the immunomodulation
and immune escape of HBeAg can be influenced by the different
genotypes/subgenotypes.
SHORT SIGHTED EVOLUTION,
TRANSMISSIBILITY AND CLINICAL
MANIFESTATION RELATED TO HBeAG
EXPRESSION
Broadly, HBeAg-negativity is preferable at the individual host
level whereas HBeAg-positivity is more favourable at the
population level (Milich and Liang, 2003). As the natural course
of HBV infection progresses from the HBeAg-positive (high
replicative/low inflammatory) phase to the HBeAg-negative
(chronic hepatitis) phase, T cell tolerance is ending as HBeAg
expression changes from its secreted soluble to the cytosolic
form. As a immunotolerogen and a decoy, secreted HBeAg is
beneficial during the early phases of the infection, whereas the
cytosolic form represents a liability considering that this form is
processed and presented to MHC class I. Furthermore, HBeAg
expressed in vivo is superior to HBcAg as a target, directly,
or indirectly, of HBcAg/HBeAg-specific CTLs (Frelin et al.,
2009). This differential CTL recognition of HBeAg, expressed
by wild-type virus, may result in the preferential elimination
of wild-type relative to HBeAg-negative HBV (Frelin et al.,
2009). As a consequence, viral diversity increases during the
course of infection, with the emergence of strains defective in
HBeAg expression, which can escape the immune response and
persist albeit at the cost, in some cases, of reduced replication,
decreased transmissibility and increased virulence (Figure 5).
Thus, this adaptive evolution of HBV during the course of
HBeAg-seroconversion can be considered short-sighted when it
limits the ability of the virus to transmit to new hosts, either by
reducing per contact transmissibility or reducing contact rate of
infected hosts because of increased virulence that can result in
death (Lythgoe et al., 2017). The increased virulence can also be a
result of the loss of immune tolerance. The ability of the different
genotypes/subgenotypes to lead to HBeAg seroconversion can
influence the degree of short-sighted evolution of HBV.
RELATIONSHIP OF GENOTYPES AND
SUBGENOTYPES TO SHORT-SIGHTED
EVOLUTION
As discussed above, mutations in the BCP/precore region, can
affect HBeAg expression at the transcriptional, translational and
post-translational level, and these mutations do not develop
in all genotypes/subgenotypes at the same frequency (Table 1,
Figures 3, 4). Subgenotype A2 and genotype H, develop only
mutations 1762T/1764A, which affect transcription of precore
mRNA and result in decreased levels of HBeAg (Buckwold
et al., 1996; Baptista et al., 1999), without switching off HBeAg
expression. Thus, these (sub)genotypes, which have been shown
to have a relatively high frequency of HBeAg-positivity (Tanaka
et al., 2004) are expected to have a long HBeAg high replicative,
low inflammatory phase. This allows HBV to be transmitted
sexually since it can remain asymptomatic allowing maturity for
sexual activity and a healthy host (Araujo et al., 2011) before the
development of cirrhosis and HCC. In fact, in a study carried
out in the USA, genotype A (subgenotype A2 is predominates
over A1 in the USA) was predominantly transmitted via sexual
(82%) or parenteral (54%) routes compared to genotype B and
C, which were transmitted vertically (Chu et al., 2003). On the
other hand, the persistence of 1762T/1764A mutant expressing
HBeAg, even at relatively low levels, means that the hepatocytes
expressing HBeAg will be targeted, leading to liver injury and
consequent development of cirrhosis and HCC much later in life.
A high prevalence of 1762T/1764A has been detected in HBV
strains from HCC patients compared to asymptomatic carriers
of HBV (Baptista et al., 1999).
G1896A is the classical HBeAg-negative mutation that affects
the translation of HBeAg by introducing a stop codon that
truncates the HBeAg precursor and HBeAg is not expressed.
Genotypes/subgenotypes with 1858T can develop the G1896A
HBeAg-negative mutants (Table 1) and develop HBeAg-negative
chronic hepatitis. Loss of HBeAg may be a sign of shortsighted evolution because there is loss of tolerogenic ability
of HBeAg, HBeAg-negative virions are less transmissible and
cannot establish chronic hepatitis. Establishment of chronic
HBV infection following perinatal transmission requires wildtype HBV, whereas transmission of mixed wild-type/G1896A
quasipecies leads to early immune elimination and resolution
of the acute infection (Raimondo et al., 1993). G1896A occurs
more frequently in genotype D than in genotype E strains
(Figure 4), despite both having 1858T. This means that women
of childbearing age infected with genotype E will remain HBeAgpositive for longer, allowing for mother-to-child transmission,
which has resulted in high prevalence and geographical
restriction of genotype E to Africa and among African emigrants
to other regions (Mulders et al., 2004). Vertical transmission is
advantageous in restricted human populations (Li et al., 2017).
The higher HBeAg-positivity seen in individuals infected with
genotype E compared to those infected with genotype D could
confer tolerance and less serious clinical manifestations than
genotype D (Yousif et al., 2013). Genotype E was found to prevail
in Sudanese blood donors (Mahgoub et al., 2011), whereas the
liver disease patients were infected with genotype D (Yousif et al.,
2013). High ratios (>50%) of G1896A in the HBeAg-positive
phase in individuals infected with genotype D are accompanied
by persistently high viraemia and ALT elevation after anti-HBe
seroconversion and a higher risk of cirrhosis (Chu et al., 2002).
Genotype G is a HBeAg-negative strain because of a
premature stop codon at position 2 of the precore precursor
protein and G1896A. Although genotype G is replication
competent on its own (Li et al., 2007), it is always found as a

transmissibility of HBV.
co-infection with either subgenotype A2 or genotype H because
the absence of the immunotolerogenic properties of HBeAg does
not allow it to establish a persistent infection (Li et al., 2007).
Like subgenotype A2 (Figure 3), genotype H develops 1896A
infrequently and therefore can supply HBeAg in trans following
co-infection. Genotype G can be transmitted and propagated
without the helper virus and has been shown to replace genotype
A in the HBeAg-negative phase of infection (Li et al., 2007)
but requires the presence of helper virus expressing HBeAg in
the early phases of infection in immunocompetent hosts (Kato
et al., 2002). The absence of immunomodulatory HBeAg means
that this genotype G alone can only infect immunocompromised
individuals (Li et al., 2007). This is the reason why this genotype is
relatively rare and is transmitted by high risk transmission chains
including males-who-have-sex-with-men (MSMs), intravenous
drug users (IVDUs) and blood transfusions.
Subgenotype A1 is the only strain that develops G1862T and
HBV strains with G1862T have been isolated from tumorous
but not from adjacent non-tumorous liver tissue (Kramvis et al.,
1998). Thus, patients, infected with subgenotype A1 with the
characteristic suboptimal Kozak sequence preceding the precore
start codon, together with 1762T/1764A and 1862T mutant,
would have severely decreased levels of HBeAg. The reduction
or absence of HBeAg in the serum would result in the loss of
immunotolerance and in the immune response being directed
to the hepatocytes because of the reduction of soluble HBeAg,
which acts as a decoy. This together with the increased ER
stress, can result in liver damage, thus contributing to the higher
hepatocarcinogenic potential of this subgenotype (Kramvis and
Kew, 2007). In individuals infected with subgneotype A1, HCC
develops 6.5 years earlier than in individuals infected with
other (sub)genotypes (Kramvis and Kew, 2007). The early
HBeAg seroconversion and the development of HCC before
the age of 30, means that this subgenotype is characterized
by the highest degree of short-sighted evolution as its mode
of transmission is limited to early horizontal transmission and
a short HBeAg-positive phase. This could be the reason why
it is the only subgenotype, which can develop the unique
mutations that affect HBeAg expression, Kozak 1809-1812
and G1862T at the translational and post-translational levels,
respectively.
KNOWLEDGE GAPS AND FUTURE
STUDIES
There is a paucity of studies on the natural history of subgenotype
A1 of HBV, which prevails in Africa as opposed to subgenotype
A2 found outside Africa. Moreover, there are no studies on
the immune response to this particular strain of HBV. Further
studies on the infection by this subgenotype in ethnic groups
of non-African descent are important to determine whether
the host genetic background influences its natural history. A
relatively high prevalence of subgenotype A1 was found in HCC
patients in southern India, and similarly to African studies,
there was an association of subgenotype A1 with HCC and its
development at a younger age (Gopalakrishnan et al., 2013).
These studies are important and relevant considering the recent

human migrations from Africa, which can lead to the dispersal of
the strain globally.
CONCLUSION
HBV is a very successful, highly evolved virus for a number of
reasons. It has evolved in such a way that it can be transmitted
by various modes, in utero, perinatally, horizontally early in
life and sexually. Various (sub)genotypes have preferable mode/s
of transmission. HBV can establish chronic infection and even
though this may have serious consequences, including the
development of cirrhosis, and HCC that may limit mobility
and hence sexual transmission, these arise later in life long
after the perinatal and neonatal transmission of the virus.
Loss of HBeAg may be a sign of short-sighted evolution
because there is loss of tolerogenic ability of HBeAg and
HBeAg-negative virions are less transmissible. The different
genotype/subgenotypes exhibit different degrees of short-sighted
evolution.
