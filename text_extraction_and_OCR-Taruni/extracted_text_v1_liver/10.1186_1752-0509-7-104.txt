Abstract
Background: Biliary atresia is a fibroinflammatory obstruction of extrahepatic bile duct that leads to end-stage liver
disease in children. Despite advances in understanding the pathogenesis of biliary atresia, very little is known about
the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in onset and progression of the disease. In this study, we aimed to investigate the
entire biliary transcriptome to identify miRNAs with potential role in the pathogenesis of bile duct obstruction.
Results: By profiling the expression levels of miRNA in extrahepatic bile ducts and gallbladder (EHBDs) from a
murine model of biliary atresia, we identified 14 miRNAs whose expression was suppressed at the times of duct
obstruction and atresia (≥2 fold suppression, P < 0.05, FDR 5%). Next, we obtained 2,216 putative target genes of
the 14 miRNAs using in silico target prediction algorithms. By integrating this result with a genome-wide gene
expression analysis of the same tissue (≥2 fold increase, P < 0.05, FDR 5%), we identified 26 potential target genes
with coordinate expression by the 14 miRNAs. Functional analysis of these target genes revealed a significant
relevance of miR-30b/c, -133a/b, -195, -200a, -320 and −365 based on increases in expression of at least 3 target
genes in the same tissue and 1st-to-3rd tier links with genes and gene-groups regulating organogenesis and
immune response. These miRNAs showed higher expression in EHBDs above livers, a unique expression in
cholangiocytes and the subepithelial compartment, and were downregulated in a cholangiocyte cell line after RRV
infection.
Conclusions: Integrative genomics reveals functional relevance of miR-30b/c, -133a/b, -195, -200a, -320 and −365.
The coordinate expression of miRNAs and target genes in a temporal-spatial fashion suggests a regulatory role of
these miRNAs in pathogenesis of experimental biliary atresia.

Background
Biliary atresia, one of the most common causes of neonatal
cholestasis, results from a fibro-inflammatory obstruction of
extrahepatic bile ducts of unknown etiology. If diagnosed
early, surgical intervention with hepatoportoenterostomy
has the potential to restore bile flow, but ongoing liver injury
results in rapid progression to cirrhosis and the need for
liver transplantation by 2 years of age in ~50% of children
[1]. Contemporary studies suggest that the pathogenesis of
bile duct injury results from an interplay between environmental factors and a biological response that involves cells
of the immune system, injury and proliferation of the biliary
epithelium, and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix
[2,3]. Insight into the activation of these processes was
obtained from large-scale gene expression analyses in livers
of infants at the time of diagnosis [4] and from extrahepatic
bile ducts and gallbladder (EHBDs) obtained from neonatal
mice in a well-established model of rotavirus-induced experimental biliary atresia [5]. In this model, Rhesus rotavirus
type-A (RRV) infection within 2–3 days of life leads to an
inflammatory obstruction of extrahepatic bile ducts within a
week, with age-restricted susceptibility [6,7]. This model has

been shown to recapitulate many features of the tissue injury and pathogenesis observed in humans with biliary atresia [2,8]. More recently, an investigation of livers from this
mouse model suggested a potential role for microRNAs in
pathogenesis of disease [9].
microRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that
regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional levels by
facilitating degradation and/or inhibiting translation of
target mRNAs. miRNAs may play important roles in the
development of the hepatobiliary system,[10] and celland tissue-specific miRNA expression profiles are altered
in some diseases, such as cirrhosis and cancers [11]. To
obtain insight into the role of miRNAs in pathogenesis of
biliary atresia, we performed comprehensive expression
analyses of miRNAs and mRNA from EHBDs at the times
of epithelial injury, lumenal obstruction, and atresia in the
experimental mouse model. Using integrative in silico approaches for miRNA and mRNA expression profiles, we
found a coordinated temporal expression of a selected
number of miRNAs and their target genes, with the activation of molecular networks regulating organogenesis
and immune responses. Spatially, the expression of these
miRNAs was higher in EHBDs (relative to livers), and was
localized in cholangiocytes and in stromal cells of the
subepithelial compartment.
Results
Time-dependent suppression of miRNAs in EHBDs
To search for miRNAs with potential roles in the pathogenesis of biliary atresia, we first performed a comprehensive survey of miRNA expression patterns in extrahepatic
bile ducts and gallbladder (collectively termed EHBDs) of
neonatal mice challenged with RRV within 24 hours of
birth. All datasets are deposited in the Gene Expression
Omnibus repository (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), with accession code GSE41595. We focused on the analysis of
EHBDs, rather than the liver, because they are the primary
site of tissue injury, beginning with an epithelial insult
(3 days), followed by lumenal obstruction with inflammatory cells (7 days) and later by atresia (14 days) [5]. In these
studies, all mice developed jaundice by 7 days, which
persisted and became associated with poor weight gain
until the time of death by 14 days after RRV challenge, as
described previously [8,12]. Among a total of 578 miRNAs,
143 changed their expression levels in EHBDs after RRV
challenge by at least 2 fold when compared to salineinjected control mice (P < 0.05, FDR 5%; Additional files 1,
2 and 3). Among these miRNAs, only miR-let-7e* was
differentially expressed in the RRV group at early phases
of epithelial injury, with a 25.8 fold decrease below
controls (3 days), while a greater number of miRNAs
was downregulated at 7 days (N = 133) and 14 days
(N = 17). Interestingly, only 6 miRNAs were upregulated
by more than 2-fold, which were all at day 7 after RRV
challenge and included miR-29b, which was reported to
be elevated in the liver of newborn mice subjected to the
same experimental model (Additional file 4) [9].
To identify candidate miRNAs with a potential role in
the pathogenesis of biliary injury, we selected miRNAs
that showed the same pattern of expression at the times
of bile duct obstruction and atresia (7 and 14 days,
respectively). We found 14 miRNAs that were consistently
suppressed at both time points (Figure 1 and Table 1);
there was no miRNA that was overexpressed at both time
points. Most of these miRNAs have been implicated in
mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinoma (miR-193b,
[13] -195, [14-16] -200a/b [15,17-19]), hepatitis C virus
infection of hepatocytes (miR-193b [20] and −320 [21]),
and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and steatohepatitis
(miR-200a/b, [22,23] Table 2). Most notably, miR-30b/c
has been reported to influence transforming growth factor
beta 1-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition and
biliary development and infection, [10,24-26] while
miR-200b, [27] -204, [28] and −320 [28] have been linked
to cholangiocarcinoma. Combined, the pattern of timedependent suppression of miRNAs and the previous link
to pathogenesis of hepatobiliary diseases formed a rationale
for new experiments to investigate the expression behavior
of those genes predicted to be targets of this subset of
miRNAs at different stages of experimental biliary atresia.
Increased expression of target genes in EHBDs
Because miRNAs execute their biological roles by regulating
expression levels of target genes, we developed a wholegenome expression platform using RNA from EHBDs at the
same time points after RRV challenge [GEO: GSE41595]. To
integrate the 14 miRNAs with the expression levels of the
related genes, we first built a list of putative target genes
Figure 1 Selection of miRNAs based on decreased expression
at days 7 and 14 after RRV challenge. One-way cluster analysis
depicts the changes in expression levels of 14 miRNAs in EHBDs at
3, 7 and 14 days after RRV challenge relative to normal saline (NS)
controls. Each column represents expression levels from pooled
samples of 2–6 EHBDs. Expression levels are depicted as color
variation from low (blue) to high (red).

based on TargetScan and miRanda prediction algorithms,
and identified 2,216 genes shared by both algorithms.
Second, we mined the gene expression platform to select
genes that changed by ≥2 fold either at 3, 7 and 14 days after
RRV challenge when compared to saline controls, and found
1,205 genes fulfilling these criteria at P < 0.05 and 5% FDR
(Additional files 5, 6 and 7). A comparison of these two lists
revealed that 53 genes were shared by both lists. Third,
given that miRNAs are thought to function by inhibiting the
level of gene expression and that the 14 miRNAs were
suppressed after RRV challenge, we examined the list of 53
genes to select genes as potential miRNA targets based on
an increase in the expression by ≥2 fold in EHBDs, and got
20 genes at 7 days and 8 genes at 14 days after RRV challenge (Table 3, Additional files 8 and 9).
Analyzing the association among the 14 miRNAs and
their potential target genes (Table 3), we found that 4
miRNAs were associated with increased expression of at
least 3 target genes at the time of lumenal obstruction
(7 days): a) miR-30b and -30c were associated with overexpression of mRNA for Pik3cd, Runx1, Cecam1, Cysltr1,
Gda, Serpine1, Soc3 and Cmpk2; b) miR-195 with Hmga1,
Il10ra, Pim1, Il7r and Has2; and c) miR-200a with Runx1,
Gbp6 and Has2 (Additional file 8). Notably, although their
selection was based on an overexpression at 7 days, cluster
analysis showed that the increase in some of these genes
began as early as 3 days and generally persisted through the
time of duct atresia (Figure 2A). From the genes selected
based on the increased expression at the time of atresia
(14 days), 8 genes were increased, of which 6 were targets of
miR-30b/c (Ceacam1, Gda, Eya2, 1110032A04Rik, Gclc, and
Slc6a9; Figure 2B, Table 3, Additional file 9). The linkage of
coordinately overexpressed genes with a small group of
miRNAs (namely miR-30b/c, -195 and 200a) formed the
rationale for informatics-based analyses to explore the
relationship of these genes and miRNAs in terms of
biological pathways and function.
Functional enrichment analysis of target genes
Using ToppCluster as a platform to integrate informatics,
streams of gene and protein function, regulation and animal
models of disease, [31] we found 1st-to-3rd levels of association (tier relationships) that were significantly enriched for
14 genes predicted to be targets of 8 miRNAs when compared to the entire genome (Fisher’s exact test with FDR 5%;
Figure 3; Additional files 10 and 11). Among these, miR30b/c, -195 and −365 had 1st tier links to biological processes of hematology and inflammation by influencing the
expression of Pim1, Il10ra, Il7r (miR-195), Arrb2 (miR-365),
Pik3cd, Cmpk2, Socs3, Cysltr1, Serpine1 and Ceacam1
(miR-30b/c). The remaining miR-200a, -320 and -133a/b
were linked to organ and tissue development via Ereg
(miR-320), Ctgf, Col8a (miR-133a/b) and Runx1 (miR-200a
and -30b/c). Thus, using integrative bioinformatics we
could predict a prominent position for miR-30b/c and
secondary positions for miR-133a/b, -195, -200a, -320
and −365 in a network based on the number of target
genes and 1st tier links with biological processes and
pathways that involved the regulation of immunity and
organogenesis, two classes of processes previously linked
to pathogenesis of biliary atresia [2,5].
Tissue and cellular expression of miRNAs
miRNAs are known to work in a cell- and tissue-specific
manner and to influence hepatobiliary organogenesis [10].
Based on the period of susceptibility of Balb/c mice to RRV
restricted to the first 2–3 days of life, [6,7] we determined
the expression level of this select group of miRNAs in livers
and EHBDs at 3, 7, and 14 days of postnatal age and 6–8
weeks of life (adults). Focusing first on the pattern of postnatal development in the liver, miR-30c and -200a increased
in suckling mice at all time points by 2–12 fold above adult
levels (Figure 4, blue lines), while miR-195 tended to
have lower levels but did not reach statistical significance. In contrast, the developmental expression in
EHBDs of miR-133b, -195 and -200a was lowest at 3 days
of age and increased progressively to adult levels, while
miR-365, -320 and -30c was highest during the suckling
period (Figure 4, brown lines). By directly comparing the
expression levels in the liver and EHBDs, we found that
miR-133a/b, -195, -200a, -320 and −365 were consistently
higher in EHBDs above livers at most time points, whereas
miR-30c expression was lower in EHBDs when normalized

to the expression level of U6 miRNA as an endogenous
control (P < 0.05, Figure 4). To obtain insight into
the normal expression of miRNAs at the cellular
level, we performed in situ hybridization of miRNAs
in EHBDs from mice at 7 days of life and found that
miR-200a was expressed largely in cholangiocytes of
the duct epithelium and peribiliary glands, and the
remaining 5 miRNAs were expressed in cholangiocytes and
subepithelial stromal cells (Figure 5). Furthermore, to investigate whether the decreased expression of the miRNAs in
EHBD after RRV challenge was not a consequence of a
decrease in the number of cholangiocytes during the biliary
injury, we quantified the expression levels of the 6 miRNAs
in a cholangiocyte cell line (mCl) cultured in the presence
or absence of RRV. This in vitro system has been
shown to recapitulate the cell-specific pattern of RRV
infection and shared mechanism of virus-cholangiocyte
interaction [8,32]. After 24 hours of RRV infection
(100 multiplicity of infection [MOI]), the expression
levels were downregulated by 1.30 to 1.53-fold for
miR-365, miR-195, miR-30c and miR-200a (Figure 6)
below levels of the vehicle control. Interestingly, the
expression of miR-320 and miR-133b trended down
in RRV-challenged cholangiocytes, but did not reach
to significance.
Discussion
From two comprehensive datasets displaying the expression
of miRNAs and mRNAs in EHBDs at early phases of epithelial injury, onset of duct obstruction, and duct atresia, we
identified miR-30b/c, -133a/b, -195, -200a, -320 and −365 as
candidate miRNAs with potential roles in pathogenesis of
experimental biliary atresia. The selection of miRNAs was
based on a stringent statistical approach to identify miRNAs
based on the highest changes in the level of expression, the
simultaneous over-expression of target genes in a tissueand time-restricted fashion, and the expression of miRNAs
in the epithelial lining of EHBDs. The miRNAs formed
groups with 1st-to-3rd tier associations with genes involved
in biological processes and pathways regulating tissue organogenesis and immune response, processes that have been
linked to pathogenic mechanisms of biliary atresia [2,5].
miRNAs are increasingly recognized as regulators of liver
physiology and diseases [11]. By regulating the levels of specific mRNAs and their posttranscriptional regulation,
miRNAs have been linked to the pathogenesis of viral hepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and steatohepatitis,
fibrogenesis and hepatocellular carcinoma. For biliary atresia, a recent report identified miR-29a to be increased in the
livers of neonatal mice subjected to a similar RRV infection
protocol, and to target the Igf1 and Il1rap genes in vivo [9].

In our study, we focused primarily on EHBDs because it is
the primary site of the inflammatory response that injures
cholangiocytes and produces the obstructive lesion typical of
experimental atresia. Previously, we used a similar approach
to survey the gene expression signature in bile ducts in
search of genes or gene-groups with potential roles in
pathogenesis of biliary atresia [5]. The strength of the approach was validated in subsequent studies showing that the
suppression of gene groups induced by the loss of CD8+
lymphocytes [12] and natural killer [33] and dendritic cells
[34] substantially decreased epithelial injury, prevented bile
duct obstruction, and improved cholestasis.
Reasoning that the highest fold changes in miRNA expression in the microarray are more likely to be validated
by other techniques (example: separate real-time PCR for
individual miRNAs) and represent activation or suppression of their gene products, we primarily selected those
miRNAs with ≥2 fold increase or decrease relative to agematched saline-controls. This stringent approach selected
143 miRNAs, from which we focused on 14 miRNAs
based on their shared expression behavior at 7 and 14
days, times when EHBDs undergo inflammatory obstruction and atresia, respectively. Among the 14 miRNAs,
miR-30b/c, -133a/b, -195, -200a, -320 and −365 emerged
as chief candidates of pathogenesis based on the inverse
relationship with the increased expression level of their
target genes in EHBD, high miRNA expression in EHBDs
relative to livers (with the exception of miR-30b/c), expression in cholangiocytes of the biliary epithelium, and a decreased expression of miR-365, -195, -30 and -200a in a

cholangiocyte line infected with RRV. This list of
miRNAs is much smaller than the broad miRNA profile of
livers from RRV-challenged mice reported by Hand et.al.
[9] Notably, our findings of suppressed expression of
miR-30b/c, -195, -200a and −365 in EHBDs are similar
to the suppression reported previously; [9] however, the
finding of high level of hepatic miR-29a was not strictly
reproduced in EHBDs, which in fact had an increased
expression of the family member miR-29b to 2.51 fold
above saline controls at the time of duct obstruction. It is
possible that different members of the miR-29 family may
produce differential biological effects in a tissue-specific
fashion (liver versus EHBDs), although we cannot rule out
the possibility that the lower expression in our model may
relate to a progressive loss of cholangiocytes populating
the bile duct mucosa.
The main biological processes and diseases previously
assigned to most of the 14 selected miRNAs included
hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma, nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease and steatohepatitis, and viral hepatitis infection. We also found genes associated with morphogenesis/
development despite the use of control newborn mice that

were age-matched to RRV-infected mice, thus avoiding
the confounding variable of post-natal age. This suggests a
biological scenario in which the selected genes have a role
in the cellular response to RRV in addition to their traditional role in development. Perhaps more relevant to our
experimental model of a biliary disease (biliary atresia),
only miR-30b/c, -200b, -204 and −320 have been reported
to change their expression levels in cholangiocarcinoma
tissues or cell lines, [10,25-28] with miR-30 family members increasing in lipopolysaccharide-induced NFκB activation in cholangiocytes and after Cryptosporidium
parvum infection, and being required for hepatobiliary
development [10,25,26]. Consistent with an involvement
in our model, miR-30b/c had the largest number of target
genes with increased expression at the times of duct
obstruction and atresia, and the largest number of 1st tier

which are thought to be chief biological processes involved in the pathogenesis of biliary atresia.
Conclusion
In summary, using integrative bioinformatics to screen
the biliary miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in a
complementary fashion, the expression of miRNAs in
a tissue and cell-specific fashion, and the predicted
interaction with genes and gene-groups, we identified
miR-30b/c, -133a/b, -195, -200a, -320 and −365 as candidate
miRNAs with potential roles in pathogenesis of experimental
biliary atresia. Among these, our data point to miR30b/c as an attractive miRNA for future mechanistic
studies to define how its expression in cholangiocytes
and subepithelial cells modulate pathogenic mechanisms
of disease by regulation of their target genes.
Methods
Mouse model of experimental biliary atresia
Balb/c mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Newborn mice were injected with
20 μL of a solution containing 1.5×106 fluorescent-forming
units (ffu) of RRV or 0.9% NaCl (saline) intraperitoneally
within 24 hours of birth, as described previously [5,8]. The
extrahepatic bile ducts and gallbladder were microdissected
en bloc (here collectively referred to as EHBDs) at 3, 7 and
14 days after RRV or saline injection and stabilized using
RNAlater (QIAGEN, CA) or embedded in paraffin. For
RNA extraction, 3 sets were generated for each time point
and experimental and control groups, with each set
containing 2–6 EHBDs depending on their sizes to make
sure enough RNA was available for use in experiments
quantifying the expression of miRNA and mRNA. All mice
received appropriate care consistent with criteria outlined
in the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals”
prepared by the National Academy of Sciences and
published by the National Institutes of Health. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Cincinnati
Children’s Research Foundation approved all animal
protocols.
miRNA expression arrays
To quantify miRNA expression, we first isolated total RNA
from EHBDs of RRV- or saline-injected mice using the
miRNeasy Mini Kit, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (QIAGEN); RNA integrity was verified using the Agilent
2100 Bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies, Inc., CA). Then, reverse transcription into first strand cDNA was performed
using reagents from TaqMan® MicroRNA RT Kit and Megaplex RT Primer Pools (Applied Biosystems, CA). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the TaqMan® Array
Rodent MicroRNA Card v2.0 (A and B) with the Universal
PCR Master Mix in 7900 HT Fast Real-Time PCR system
(Applied Biosystems). All samples were run in triplicate
and the relative expression was calculated using the comparative Ct method, [35] in which average Ct values of four
MammU6 probes on each plate were used as reference.
The ΔCt values were imported into GeneSpring GX 11.5
platform (Agilent Technologies) for statistical analyses.
mRNA expression arrays
Aliquots from total RNA from similar groups of EHBDs
were also applied to a genome-wide expression protocol
consisting of the synthesis of biotinylated cRNAs from
400 ng aliquots. cRNA pools were hybridized to the
oligonucleotide-based GeneChip® Mouse Gene 1.0 ST
Array (Affymetrix, CA), which contains probe sets to
quantify 28,853 genes, scanned, and monitored for specific
signals with the GeneChip® Operating Software, as described previously [5]. Affymetrix CEL files were imported
into GeneSpring GX11.5 platform and further analyzed.
miRNA target prediction and enrichment analyses
Putative targets of the miRNAs were identified using Target
Scan (http://www.targetscan.org) [36] and miRanda (http://
www.microrna.org/microrna/home.do), mouse target site
predictions with good mirSVR score and conserved miRNA,
August 2010) [37]. The genes that were listed in both prediction algorithms were adopted as putative target genes for
individual miRNAs. For functional enrichment analysis, we
used ToppCluster (http://toppcluster.cchmc.org) [31] with
Fisher’s exact test and false discovery rate (FDR) correction
to control for over-representation of biological contexts.
Combined miRNA/mRNA regulatory and functional enrichment network was drawn using Cytoscape [38].
Quantitative real-time PCR
For analyses of developmental regulation of specific
miRNAs, RNA pools from livers and EHBDs harvested
from healthy newborn Balb/c mice at days 3, 7 and 14 of
life and from 6–8 week Balb/c adult mice underwent quantitative reverse-transcription PCR using TaqMan® Universal
PCR Master Mix and specific miRNA primers (Applied
Biosystems).
In situ hybridization
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded EHBDs from 7-day
old Balb/c mice were subjected to in situ hybridization,
using miRCURY LNATM microRNA Detection Probes
(Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark) and an automated Discovery
XT system (Ventana Medical Systems, AZ), according to
manufacturer’s protocol. Rabbit anti-digoxin antibody
(Sigma-Aldrich, MO) and ChromoMab Blue kit (Ventana
Medical Systems) were used to colorize the signals, and
the slides were counterstained with Nuclear Fast Red
(Polyscientific, NY).

In vitro model of experimental biliary atresia
To quantify miRNA expression in cholangiocytes infected
with RRV, an immortalized cholangiocyte cell line (mCl) derived from BALB/c mice was infected with RRV as described
previously [32]. In brief, mCl was cultured in 24-well culture
plate and grown to 90-95% confluence. After counting cell
numbers in one well per plate, cells in the remaining wells
were washed with Earl’s Balanced Salt Solution and overlaid
with 200 μl of serum-free DMEM and 4 μl/mL trypsin
containing live virus at MOI = 100; the same solution without virus served as control. After 24 hours of incubation,
the cells were washed once with phosphate buffered saline
and total RNA was isolated using the miRNeasy Mini Kit,
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (QIAGEN). Then,
quantitative reverse-transcription PCR was performed using
TaqMan® Universal PCR Master Mix and specific miRNA
primers (Applied Biosystems). All samples were run in duplicate and the relative expression was calculated using
MammU6 as reference.
Statistical analysis
Conventional statistical procedures were applied for
miRNA and mRNA gene array experiments using
GeneSpring GX11.5 platform (t-test with a significance
of 0.05 and Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction (FDR 0.05). Fisher’s exact test was applied to
determine strength of association between miRNAs
and gene functions. For comparative analyses of realtime PCR data among developmental groups, we used
t-test with statistical significance set at P < 0.05.
