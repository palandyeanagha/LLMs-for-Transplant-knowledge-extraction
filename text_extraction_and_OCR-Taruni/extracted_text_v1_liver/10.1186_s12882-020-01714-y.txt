Abstract
Background: Kidney transplantation performed in the presence of high-titre donor-specific antibodies (DSA) may
result in hyper-acute or accelerated antibody-mediated rejection and rapid allograft loss. Previous studies have
shown that this risk may be mitigated with simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation (SLKT); however, the
mechanisms are not well defined. Here we report the evolution of pre-formed, high-level DSAs in two highly
sensitised SLKT recipients peri-operatively and describe a profound sustained depletion of all DSAs from the time of
liver anastomosis with no extra desensitisation therapy required.
Case presentation: Two patients underwent SLKT and received our centre’s standard renal transplant
immunosuppression with basiliximab and methylprednisolone for induction therapy and prednisolone,
mycophenolate and tacrolimus for maintenance therapy. HLA antibody samples were collected pre-operatively, and
immediately post-liver and post-kidney revascularisation, and then regularly in the post-transplant period.
Complement Dependant Cytotoxicity (CDC) crossmatches were also performed. Both patients were highly
sensitised with a PRA over 97%. One patient had a positive B- and T-cell crossmatch pre-transplant. These positive
CDC crossmatches became negative and the level of pre-formed DSAs reduced profoundly and rapidly, within 3 h
post-liver revascularisation. The reduction in pre-formed DSAs, regardless of subclass, was seen immediately postliver revascularisation, before implantation of the renal allografts. No significant reduction in non-donor specific
HLA-antibodies was observed. Both patients maintained good graft function with no rejection on kidney allograft
protocol biopsies performed at 10-weeks post-transplant.
Conclusions: These cases support the protective immunoregulatory role of the liver in the setting of SLKT, with no
extra desensitisation treatment given pre-operatively for these highly sensitised patients.

Background
In kidney transplantation, the presence of a positive
complement-dependent cytotoxic (CDC) crossmatch
and a high titre of donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) may
be considered a contraindication for transplantation, due
to the risk of hyper-acute rejection and subsequent graft
loss. In contrast, the presence of preformed DSAs in
liver transplant recipients has a much less deleterious
clinical effect, with no difference observed in 12-month
allograft outcomes in sensitised liver transplant recipients [1]. Simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation
(SLKT) may abrogate the risk to the kidney, as illustrated by previous case reports of successful SLKT
among highly sensitised patients [2]. Favourable clinical
outcomes, even in the presence of unfavourable immunological tests at baseline, means that transplantation
may be performed in SLKT patients that would have not
routinely be performed in kidney-alone recipients. The
mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unclear.
Here we report two highly sensitised SLKT recipients
with high-level preformed DSAs who exhibited a rapid
and profound reduction in their level of DSAs, commencing immediately from the time of liver revascularisation
and prior to the implantation of the kidney.
Case presentations
Patient 1 was a 60-year-old female who was on the
waiting list for SLKT for decompensated nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-related cirrhosis and Stage IV
chronic kidney disease, presumed secondary to Type
2 diabetes. She presented to hospital acutely unwell
with gallstone pancreatitis complicated by progressive
decompensated liver and renal failure. Her pancreatitis resolved after stent placement in pancreatic duct
at endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography
(ERCP). She continued to deteriorate clinically, despite
the resolution of pancreatitis. Prior to transplant, she had
a Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score of 40
(Sodium 126 mmol/L, Creatinine 492 μmol/L, total Bilirubin 287 μmol/L, INR 2.5) and had commenced acute
haemodialysis three times a week. She required multiple
blood transfusions prior to transplantation and had a calculated panel reactive antibodies (cPRA) for Class I and II
HLA antigens of 99%. She received a combined kidneyliver donor offer from the same donor, against which she
had multiple class I and II DSAs with mean fluorescence
intensity (MFI) above 20,000, as well as a positive T- and
B-cell CDC crossmatch, as shown in Table 1. Given her
deteriorating clinical condition, she proceeded to transplantation despite the high immunological risk.
Patient 2 was a 63-year-old female with a history of
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney and liver disease
who had been on the deceased donor transplant wait list
for 2 years. She was highly sensitised with a cPRA for
Class II HLA antigens of 97%; she had a history of 2 previous pregnancies. The T- and B-cell CDC crossmatch
was negative; however, she had class II DSAs with MFIs
above 10,000, as shown in Table 1. Given her degree of
sensitisation, and in the presence of a negative crossmatch, it was deemed reasonable to proceed with this
donor to transplantation.
Both recipients underwent SLKT with no pretransplant conditioning. It was considered clinically unsafe to administer any pre-conditioning therapy to Patient 1 because of her perilous clinical state. In the
presence of a negative CDC crossmatch and in view of
previous clinical experience at our centre, it was felt that
there was no compelling indication for additional desensitisation therapy in Patient 2. Hence, both patients received our centre’s standard renal transplant induction
therapy with methylprednisolone and basiliximab, and
their maintenance immunosuppression included prednisolone, mycophenolate and tacrolimus with a target
trough level of 6-8 ng/ml.

Both patients underwent SLKT as per the centre’s
usual practice with no deliberate delay in kidney transplantation. The cold ischaemic times for the liver and
kidney allografts were 225 and 407 min respectively for
Patient 1; and 348 and 411 min respectively for patient
2. Immediately following liver revascularisation, the level
of donor-specific antibodies in both recipients had
dropped significantly. Patient 1’s positive crossmatch
subsequently became negative within 3 h after liver
revascularisation. All DSAs continued to decrease posttransplantation (Fig. 1). This finding was also apparent
with the C1q-binding HLA antibody analysis. This reduction was not apparent for non-donor specific preformed HLA antibodies.
Patient 2 had a substantial rebound in a single DSA
directed against DR7 to an MFI of 15,210 at day 20
post-transplant, whilst maintaining stable renal and
liver graft function, as seen in Fig. 1. This was also
reflected in the C1q-binding HLA antibody analysis,
with MFI of 28,131. In view of these results, and in
the absence of any clinical evidence to suggest acute
allograft dysfunction caused by this antibody, her Tacrolimus dose was increased to aim for a trough level
of 8-10 ng/ml, instead of 6-8 ng/ml. By day 40 posttransplant and after augmented immunosuppression,
no DSA was detectable.
Both recipients maintained good liver and kidney
allograft function, as shown in Fig. 2. As well, no episodes of kidney or liver allograft rejection were observed in either patient. At 10 weeks post-SLKT they
both had no rejection on protocol kidney allograft biopsies, with negative C4d immunostaining. Patient 1’s
12-month kidney allograft protocol biopsy was normal
with no evidence of rejection (Banff lesion score 0),
and no DSA detected in her serum at 1-year posttransplantation. Neither patient has required a liver
allograft biopsy, with stable liver allograft function.
Discussion and conclusions
The liver plays an important role in abrogating the
risk of rejection and graft loss in highly sensitised patient undergoing SLKT. Our cases demonstrate a
rapid reduction in both Class I and II DSAs post-liver
revascularisation, prior to administration of standard
induction therapy. Neither patient received extra desensitisation treatment prior to transplantation, and
both have had excellent clinical outcomes to date
with standard immunosuppression and with no rejection episodes. Although, the follow up of our two
cases is relatively short and poorer long-term outcomes have been reported in SLKT patients at later
time points [3, 4].
These cases confirm an immunoregulatory role for the
liver in protecting the kidney allograft in the setting of
SLKT, as has been similarly described in a prospective
observational study by O’leary et. al. who also noted preformed Class I DSAs, even with MFI values> 10,000,
were adequately cleared [5]. However, unlike our cases,
the Class II DSAs typically persisted after transplantation. Other studies have also suggested that class II
DSAs may persist post-SLKT, predominantly those directed against DQ antigens [4, 6, 7]. It has been hypothesised that the preferential clearance of Class I over Class II
DSAs could be attributed to the different expression of
Class I and II HLA molecules on the liver allograft [4].
There is a considerably lower density of Class II expression and secretion in the liver parenchyma and vasculature resulting in partial removal of Class II DSA [8]. In
patient 2 we observed rebound in a single class II DSA at
day 20 post-transplant, which subsequently disappeared
with augmented immunosuppression by day 40, with no
evidence of rejection of either allograft. To our knowledge,
this is the first report that demonstrates the rapid reduction in the MFIs of the DSAs at liver revascularisation,
and before the implantation of the kidneys. There was no

significant reduction in non-donor specific HLA antibodies demonstrated.
As well as the removal of HLA antibodies, the liver
allograft is also capable of rapidly converting a positive
T- and B-cell CDC crossmatch to negative. With the use
of various pre-transplant desensitisation treatments prior
to SLKT, previous case reports have confirmed that this
may occur, with the earliest conversion reported at 1 h
post-liver revascularisation [9–11]. Patient 1 is the first
case report that the authors are aware of where this
phenomenon has been demonstrated in the absence of
extra desensitisation therapy. In patient 1 the conversion
from a positive to negative T- and B-cell CDC crossmatch was observed within 3 h post-liver revascularisation. She had no DSA at 12-month post-transplant with
the use of a standard immunosuppression regimen.
Previous reports have illustrated various strategies
attempting to abrogate rejection in the setting of a positive crossmatch, including the use of intravenous immunoglobulin, Rituximab and plasmapheresis [12].
Desensitisation; however, did not improve patient allograft outcomes in one Kaplan-Meier analysis [3]. With
no additional conditioning or immunosuppression, both
of our patients have so far experienced good clinical outcomes with no evidence of rejection to date. It must be
borne in mind; however, that poorer long-term outcomes have previously been reported in SLKT patients
[5]. These cases may indicate that it is possible to avoid
the use of additional immunosuppression therapies at
induction whilst still achieving favourable clinical outcomes in the setting of SLKT.
Despite the increasing number of SLKTs performed
world-wide [13], there are issues that remain
outstanding. Firstly, the optimal induction and maintenance immunosuppressive therapy for these patients is
not clear. Our cases suggest that additional desensitisation treatment in these patients may potentially be
avoided. Secondly, the precise mechanistic role of the
liver in abrogating the clinical effect of the DSAs and attenuating the positive immunological crossmatches in
these highly sensitised SLKT patients is not well understood. Traditionally, it was thought the role of the liver
is to absorb DSAs. Taner et al. demonstrated that the
liver is also capable of shifting the pattern of renal allograft gene expression away from pro-inflammation,
thereby preserving renal allograft function [14]. Thirdly,
there is a lack of robust long-term clinical data concerning the clinical outcomes of SLKT. Some small studies
suggest a higher incidence of transplant rejection, particularly in highly sensitised patients compared to nonsensitised patients, while others have demonstrated
lower incidences of both acute and chronic antibodymediated rejection [3, 5, 15]. Lastly, the significance of
delayed implantation of the kidney allograft in highly
sensitised patients has not been evaluated. Lunsford
et al. and Ekser et al. both found that delayed implantation of kidney allografts was associated with improved
patients and renal allografts survival in the SLKT population [16, 17]. However, they have not reported on the
degree of sensitisation on their cohort of patients.
These cases demonstrate that high level DSAs and
positive T- and B-cell CDC crossmatches should not
preclude SLKT in highly sensitised patients, particularly
when their risk of remaining un-transplanted is high;
however, this report is only of two cases and their longterm clinical outcomes are not yet available. The risk of

antibody-mediated rejection amongst these patients remains high, mandating clinical vigilance and close monitoring in the post-transplant period. We undertook
regular screening for DSAs in the post-transplant period,
initially weekly and then monthly, to monitor for the
risk of anti-body mediated rejection, allowing us to augment patient 2’s immunosuppression in response to the
rebound seen in their class II DSAs. In selected patients,
such as ours, we have observed good outcomes to date
with standard immunosuppression and without the use
of additional desensitisation prior to SLKT.
