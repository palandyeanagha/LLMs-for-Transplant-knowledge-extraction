Solid organ transplantations save lives in patients affected by terminal organ failures and
improve quality of life. Organ transplantations have gradually ameliorated in the last two
decades and usually provide excellent results in children and young adults, and are increasingly challenged by the growing proportion of elderly transplant patients with comorbidities.
Renal transplantation increases patient survival over dialysis, and lifesaving transplants are
indispensible to treat patients with liver, heart, or lung irreversible diseases. Solid organ
transplant programs activity has been steadily growing but is still far from global needs,
with great differences among countries. Solid organ transplantations are essential for developed and mature health care systems.
The introduction of antibiotics, massive vaccinations of the general population to prevent infectious diseases, and organ transplantation may be considered the miracles of twentieth
century medicine. Organ transplantation is the
best therapy for terminal and irreversible organ
failure. Kidney transplantation introduced in
the 1950s was the pioneer solid organ transplant
to treat patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) in an era when renal replacement therapies were in their first steps. The gradual introduction of dialysis increased the recipients’ pool
of renal transplant candidates, who may abandon dialysis after a successful transplantation. In
the so-called era of conventional immunosuppression based on the use of azathioprine and
steroids, the rejection rates and early graft failure
were high, and nonrenal solid organ transplant
programs without supportive replacement therapies had poor results with very few of them
having regular activity until the early 1980s. The
introduction of cyclosporine 30 years ago improved transplant outcomes, and solid organ
transplant programs were generalized all over
the developed world.
According to activity data reported to the
Global Observatory on Donation and Transplantation (GODT) (World Health Organization 2012a), analysis from 2010 transplant
activity for 95 countries, representing nearly
90% of the worldwide population, shows that
106,879 solid organ transplants were performed worldwide: 73,179 kidney transplants
(46% from living donors), 21,602 liver transplants (15% from living donors), 5582 heart
transplants, 3927 lung transplants, 2362 pancreas transplants, and 227 small bowel. This activity
increased 2.12% during 2009, but it is estimated

that it is far from global needs. On the other
hand, there are huge geographical differences
on transplant activity ranging from .70 per
million population (p.m.p.) in developed countries to 0–2.4 p.m.p. in developing countries.
The implementation of transplant programs requires social altruism for organ donation, optimization of transplant clin-ical practices, and an
economic effort by the distinct health care systems. Such commitments around organ transplantation aim to improve the life expectancy,
clinical condition, and quality of life of solid
organ transplant recipients.
The clinical importance of solid organ transplantations may be evaluated according to their
impact on patient survival, the reduction of comorbidity, improvement of labor life, and global
quality of life of transplant population.
ESRD patients may survive with supportive
dialysis, and diabetic patients with insulin therapy. In contrast, in the absence of long-lasting
artificial organ support or inefficient pharmacological treatment, solid organ transplantation
becomes a lifesaving therapy in patients with
irreversible liver, heart, and respiratory failures.
As the distinct solid organ transplants will
be addressed in specific articles in this collection, this introductory article will be mainly focused on transplant outcomes and benefits derived from organ transplantations, which obviously give sense to these therapies.
KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATION
Despite that renal transplantation is considered
the best therapeutic option for the treatment of
ESRD, access to transplantation varies among
centers (Ravanan et al. 2010) and countries (Stel
et al. 2005). The mean percentage of ESRDprevalent patients included in the waiting list
is 20% –25%, but some centers and countries
may have lower percentages of ESRD patients
listed. Comorbidity and demographic factors
may account for differences in the access to
transplantation. Activation on the waiting list
in the first 2 years of the start of renal replacement therapy (RRT) significantly decreases with
older age, nonwhite ethnicity, and diabetes mellitus, and the probability of receiving a kidney
transplant follows a similar trend. According to
the United Kingdom Transplant Registry, the
probability of receiving a kidney allograft is reduced by .40% in older recipients in comparison with young patients, and by .30% in
nonwhites in comparison with Caucasians. Differences among centers on the time taken to
activate inclusion on the waiting list and the
proportion of listed patients with ESRD may
widely vary, and a similar observation also applies regarding the access to transplantation
(Ravanan et al. 2010). These center disparities
may not be strictly explained by patient-related
factors and might reflect distinct center criteria
on a candidate’s evaluation for renal transplantation. A patient starting dialysis in a nontransplanting renal center was less likely to be registered for transplantation (odds ratio 0.85, 0.77
to 0.94) or receive a transplantfrom a donorafter
cardiac death or a living kidney donor (0.69, 0.59
to 0.80) compared with patients cared for in
transplanting renal centers but with similar
chances of receiving a transplant from a donor
after brain stem death. In another study conducted in England and Wales, specific variables
significantly associated with listing were age,
primary renal disease, graft number, social deprivation, and ethnicity but not gender. In contrast with the previous publication, other investigators have reported that whether the renal
unit was also a transplant unit was not significant (Dudley et al. 2009). A multinational European study based on the ERA-EDTA Registry
(2010) analyzing the access to transplantation by
country and comorbid status showed that the
relative risk of receiving a first transplant within
4 years after the start of renal replacement infour
European countries varies from 0.26 to 4.10 in
patients without comorbidity and from 0.12 to
3.19 in patients with comorbidity. These international differences in access to transplantation
were attributed to differences in the availability
of donor kidneys in relation to the number of
dialysis patients, and were only partly owing to
comorbid variability (Stel et al. 2005). This and
other previous studies (Jager et al. 2001; Miskulin et al. 2002) show that sicker patients remain
on dialysis programs and the healthier patients
are selected for renal transplantation to have

acceptable graft and patient survivals with this
therapeutic modality, taking into account the
limited number of organs available nowadays
for renal transplantation. Clinical guidelines
for the evaluation, selection, and preparation
of the potential kidney transplant recipient
may help to standardize access to renal transplantation (Dudley and Harden 2011). This approach is especially relevant with the current
high incidence and prevalence of patients with
ESRD. According to the recently published annual 2009 renal replacement report of the ERAEDTA Registry (van de Luijtgaarden et al. 2012),
in Europe the overall incidence rate of ESRD
patients was 125 p.m.p., and the overall prevalence was 730 p.m.p., with wide variations
among countries. From 2005 to 2009, the relative
change of the hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal
dialysis (PD), and transplantation distribution
(at day 91 after the start of RRT) was an overall
0.5% decrease in HD, 1.4% decrease in PD utilization, and, interestingly, a 1.8% increase of
patients living on a functioning graft. The assessment of waiting list dynamics may help to
provide a better understanding of the limitations and contributions of renal transplantation
to the treatment of ESRD. The Renal Patients
Registry of Catalonia (2010) shows that for
new cases in 1990 –2010 that were not excluded
from the waiting list at the start of RRT, at 10
years, 54% had a functioning transplant, 5.2%
were on the waiting list, 2.3% were pending
study, 8.1% were excluded, and the remaining
30.2% had died. According to the same registry,
despite the older age and the increase of incident
and prevalent ESRD patients in the last two decades, the waiting list size has not increased,
the proportion of patients excluded because of
clinical reasons remains quite constant, the exclusion for age has decreased by 50%, and the
proportion of patients with a functioning transplant has increased from 30% in 1990 to 54%
in 2010. These data suggest new clinical attitudes to offer renal transplantation to a larger
number of ESRD patients despite their older age
and comorbidity. In some European countries
with very active transplant programs such as
Norway, 70% of the patients on RRTwere living
with a functioning graft (591 p.m.p.). Also, the
number of kidney transplants performed p.m.p.
in 2009 widely varied among countries, the
highest being in some regions of Spain (Cantabria, Catalonia) with 70 transplants p.m.p.
These wide variations on the incidence and
prevalence of ESRD and transplant activities
across Europe strongly suggest that there is
room for improving an integrated approach in
the diagnosis and treatment of ESRD patients,
including active policies to promote organ donation and transplantation.
The selection of transplant candidates with
better clinical conditions may contribute to the
better patient survival in comparison to the distinct dialysis modalities. In the cohort of patients between 2000 and 2004, 5-yr patient survival on dialysis adjusted for age, gender, and
primary renal disease was 48%. Adjusted patient
survivals for first deceased donor transplantation were 91%, and for living donor 94%. Adjusted 5-year graft survival during this same
time period were 79% and 85% for deceased
and living donor kidney transplants, respectively (Fig. 1) (van de Luijtgaarden et al. 2012).
Children have excellent transplant outcomes. In
2011, according to the Scientific Registry for
Transplant Recipients, for deceased and living
donor transplants, the estimated 1-year conditional half-lives were 11.9 years and 15.3 years in
pediatric populations.
According to the 2012 USRD Annual Data
Report, 117,000 new patients began treatment for ESRD in the United States in 2010
(incidence rate 348 p.m.p.), 10 times more patients than 30 years ago. The majority of ESRD
patients started on HD (91%), 7% on PD, and
2% received a kidney allograft. The number of
prevalent patients was almost 600,000. Of the
ESRD population, 30% had a kidney transplant,
65% of them are on HD, and 7% are treated
with PD. Importantly, the mortality of patients
on dialysis has decreased 26% since 1985. However, mortality for dialysis patients is still far
higher than in the general population and transplant patients (USRDS Annual Data Report
2012). In the 2005 patients’ cohort, 5-year adjusted survival probabilities were 35% for HD,
41% for PD, and 73% for kidney transplant
recipients. The adjusted 10-year graft survival

for deceased donor transplants has increased
from 18.8% in 1980 to 42.7% in 2000, and
from 46.2% in 1980 to 58.6% in 2000 for living
donor transplants. This gradual amelioration of
transplant results is especially relevant taking
into account the permanent increase of age of
incident and prevalent patients with RRT, which
has augmented by 10 years from the mid1980s to 2010 up to 64.8 years and 60.8 years
for incident and prevalent patients, respectively
(Renal Patients Registry of Catalonia 2010).
Another benefit of renal transplantation
may be the reduction of hospital readmissions.
Rates of hospitalization for ESRD patients are
double those of the general population. Renal
transplantation has importantly reduced hospitalization indexes in comparison with HD, for
which the rate is 36% for all-cause rehospitalization. The total admission rates for dialysis patients have barely changed in the last decade
as per 1000 patient years; period-prevalent patients by age, gender, ethnicity, and primary
diagnosis were 1889 in 1993 and 1856 in 2010.
For transplant patients, the rates were 1020 in
1993 and 841 in 2010.
Preemptive Renal Transplantation
Among the distinct alternatives for the treatment of ESRD, renal transplantation may also
be the first therapeutic option of RRT to avoid
dialysis. Prolonged dialysis time is considered
a detrimental factor for transplant survival
(Meier-Kriesche et al. 2000; Meier-Kriesche
and Schold 2005; Kasiske et al. 2010) and increases the risk of hospital admission after transplantation (Gram et al. 2012). Preemptive renal
transplantation (PRT) may avoid dialysis-related comorbidity, improve quality of life, and provide better transplant outcomes. Data reported a
decade ago showed that longer waiting times on
dialysis negatively impact on posttransplant
graft and patient survival. In a paired kidney
study on the impact of pretransplant dialysis
on graft survival, dialysis time before transplantation longer than 2 years was associated with
29% 10-year graft survival rates in comparison
with 63% in patients with 0–6 months on dialysis (Meier-Kriesche and Kaplan 2002). As PRT
is associated with better patient and graft survival than transplantation after dialysis, this
therapeutic option might be favored in all
ESRD patients at the time of initiation of RRT
and has been more common in the last 15 years.
It has also been performed at higher levels
of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR),
particularly among recipients of live-donor
transplants (Friedewald and Reese 2012). In
the United States, preemptive listing for kidney
transplantation has increased in the last decade
(Davis 2010) and occurs in 16.6% –21.3% of
listed patients. Patients with less comorbid clinical entities, such as patients with polycystic kidney disease (41.9%) and glomerulonephritis
(24.6%), were more often listed before dialysis
than those with hypertension (12.2%) and diabetes (14.4%) (Keith et al. 2008).
Because of the better outcomes of pancreas –
kidney transplantation (PKT), it has been
claimed as the optimal therapy for patients

with ESRD, especially if a living donor is available. PKT might be favored with an improved
patient access to nephrology and transplant
care, and better education of the community
and healthcare personnel (Davis 2010). Nevertheless, recent studies have raised new concerns
about the consequences of early versus late PKT
(Friedewald and Reese 2012) and how to find
an adequate “balance of benefit (maximization
of utility) and justice (fairness in organ allocation)” (Petrini 2009).
Owing to the benefits of PKT, we might see a
wider adoption of this therapeutic alternative in
the coming years (Huang and Samaniego 2012).
Renal Transplantation in Older Recipients
The age of patients with ESRD initiating RRT
has gradually increased in the last decade. According to the ERA-EDTA Registry, in 2009, the
mean age of incident patients was 64.1 years.
This implies that the proportion of patients
older than 60 years on RRT in some areas may
be higher than 60% and patients older than 70
years account for more than 50% (Renal Patients
Registry of Catalonia 2010). This results in an
increasing proportion of older patients on waiting lists and, in the last years of the past decade,
.30% of kidney transplant recipients were
60 years or older. This translates to an increment
of prevalent older patients with a functioning
allograft that was very low in the mid-1980s,
whereas in 2010 it accounted for 34% of patients
with a kidney transplant. The growing proportion of elderly patients has also been observed in
other solid organ transplant programs, especially in lung and heart transplants (Abecassis et al.
2012). Although it is well known that graft and
patient survival are poorer in older suitable patients than in younger recipients, renal transplantation from deceased or living donor decreases mortality in older patients by .30%
over those patients remaining on dialysis (Table
1) (ERA-EDTA Registry 2010). Older transplant
recipients frequently suffer from comorbid
conditions such as cardiovascular disease, infections, malignancies, physical limitations, cognition alterations, and overall reduced quality of
life. Older age is associated with an increased
frequency of early readmissions after transplantation (McAdams-Demarco et al 2012). The risk
of death is also exacerbated in older recipients.
The mortality rate in patients older than 60 years
in the first year after transplantation ismore than
double that in younger recipients (10.5% vs.
4.4%), which is aggravated with comorbidities
and whether the patient received an ECD kidney.
Nevertheless, older recipients have shorter life
expectancies than younger patients and might
benefit from receiving kidneys from ECD donors to increase access to transplantation. The
potential utility of allocating kidneys from donors 65 years to recipients of the same age (old
to old), regardless of human leukocyte antigen
(HLA) matching and with short cold ischemia
time, was addressed in the Eurotransplant organization 10 years ago in the so-called Eurotransplant Senior Program (ESP) (Frei et al. 2008). In
this program, graft and patient survival were not
negatively affected by the ESP allocation when
compared with standard allocation, suggesting
that donor/recipient age matching could increase the number of elderly recipients transplanted, which might result in a longer life expectancy compared with dialysis.
SOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION IN
DIABETIC PATIENTS
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 347 million people worldwide have
diabetes, .80% of people with diabetes live in
low- or middle-income countries, and projects
that diabetes deaths will double between 2005
and 2030 (World Health Organization 2012b).

The most severe and well-known complications
of diabetes such as retinopathy, cardiovascular
disease, neuropathy, and nephropathy greatly
deteriorate the diabetic patient clinical condition and reduce life expectancy. According
to the WHO, a total of 57 million deaths occurred in the world during 2008; 36 million
(63%) were attributable to noncommunicable
diseases, principally cardiovascular diseases (17
million), cancer (7.6 million), chronic respiratory diseases (4.2million), and diabetes (1.3million). Diabetes entails a high risk of ESRD and
premature mortality, even higher than in cancer
patients. The mortality risk of patients with diabetes and nephropathy is higher than the average mortality rate of all types of cancer (Lambers
Heerspink and de Zeeuw 2011). Diabetic nephropathy is now not only the leading cause of
ESRDinmuch ofAustralasia, Europe, andNorth
America, but also in less wealthy countries, including India, several Latin American countries,
Malaysia, and Turkey (White et al. 2012). Diabetic nephropathy accounts for 35% of ESRD
in Australasia, 38% in the United States, and
28% in Europe.
RRT therapy in diabetic patients with ESRD
consists of supportive dialysis, and, in suitable
candidates, renal transplantation, and also simultaneous kidney/pancreas transplantation
or pancreas alone, reverse diabetes and attenuate
or prevent diabetic complications. In Europe,
in the cohort of incident patients in 2001 –
2005, diabetics on dialysis programs had the
worst 5-year survival, either on PD or on HD,
with an average rate of 39%, below the 50.9%
observed in all patients (ERA-EDTA Registry
2010). In this registry, in eligible patients, renal
transplantation increased 5-year survivals up
to 85.1% in deceased donor transplants and up
to 85.6% in living donor transplants, although
below the rates reported for all patients (91%
for deceased donor and 94.2% for living donor
transplants).
Besides kidney transplantation alone in
ESRD diabetic patients, the beneficial effects of
pancreas transplantation have been a matter of
discussion. Pancreas transplant programs were
initiated more than 20 years ago in several countries and have progressively ameliorated their
results. According to a recent summary of the
International Pancreas Registry (Gruessner
2011), “at the end of 2010 more than 35,000
pancreas transplantations have been reported;
24,000 transplantations in the United States
and more than 12,000 outside the United States.
The types of pancreas transplantations performed have been simultaneously with a kidney
(SPK) (75%), those given after a previous kidney
transplantation (PAK) (18%), and pancreas
transplantation alone (PTA) (7%).” In these
last three decades, optimization of surgical techniques and the introduction of low-toxicity immunosuppression have gradually improved the
outcomes of pancreas transplantation, regarding patient survival and graft function. “Patient
survival now reaches over 95% at 1 year posttransplant and over 83% after 5 years. The best
graft survival was found in SPK with 86% pancreas and 93% kidney graft function at 1 year.
PAK pancreas graft function was 80%, and PTA
pancreas graft function reached 78% at 1 year.”
The beneficial effects of euglycemia on diabetic complications may not be clearly evident
in the short term after transplantation but may
be noticed in the long term. In nonuremic patients with long-term type 1 diabetes, with mild
to advanced diabetic nephropathy lesions at
baseline, no significant changes were observed
after 5 years of pancreas transplantation. But in
most patients, glomerular, tubular, and interstitial lesions markedly improved at 10 years, indicating that a prolonged time of normoglycemia may heal diabetic nephropathy (Fioretto
and Mauer 2011).
Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of
blindness. Despite initial controversies on the
beneficial effects of pancreas transplantation
on this severe complication, PTA seems also to
improve or stabilize diabetic retinopathy in
.50% of patients 2 years after transplantation
(Giannarelli et al. 2006), suggesting that a functioning pancreas graft may prevent visual loss in
diabetic patients. Successful pancreas transplantation may also improve sensory or motor neuropathy according to electrophysiology studies (Allen et al. 1997; Martinenghi et al. 1997;
Navarro et al. 1997), findings recently supported
by experimental data (Spadella et al. 2012).

Islet transplantation may be a therapeutic
alternative to pancreas transplantation to restore
normal glucose metabolism in type 1 diabetes,
providing a 59% insulin independence rate in
comparison with 75% with PTA, which might
suggest that islets transplantation should be offered as a first alternative only in patients with
high surgical risk, although the debate is still
open on the role of these two types of transplantation in the treatment of diabetes (Maffi et al.
2011).
LIFESAVING SOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANTS
Liver Transplantation
Liver transplantation (LT) is the second most
frequently performed transplant after kidney
transplantation. According to the 2010 report
of the European Liver Transplant Registry, the
main indications for LTare cirrhosis (58%), cancers (14%), cholestatic diesases (10%), acute hepatic failure (8%), metabolic diseases (6%), and
other diseases (4%). Datafrom the same registry
show that 1-year and 5-year patient survivals
according to the number of liver transplantations were 87% and 62% in patients with first
LT, 75% and 47% for second LT, and 75% and
44% for third LT, respectively. 5-Year graft survivals according to the number of transplants
were 55%, 29%, and 36%, for first, second, and
third LT, respectively (European Liver Transplant
Registry 2012). In the increasing proportion of
elderly recipients (.60 years), patient survivals
are slightly lower, but acceptable, than in all patients with same indications for transplantation.
Liver transplant activity has increased in Europe
since the 1980s, peaking in 2007 with .6000 LT,
probably owing to wider acceptance donor criteria, including older donors. Advanced donor
age significantly reduces 10-year-graft survivals
from 55%for donors ,55 years, 47%for donors
55 –65 years, to 45% for donors 65 years, although these rates are considered clinically acceptable. Pediatric LT recipients have excellent
outcomes with significantly higher 10-year survival rates (76%) over adults (59%). Among the
adult LT recipients population, increasing age
has a gradual negative impact on survivals
from 65% 10-year patient survival in recipients
aged 15 –45 years, 59% in 45 –60 years, and 49%
in patients 60 years. Despite the negative impact of donor and recipient age on LToutcomes,
survival rates reported are considered clinically
relevant in patients with life-threatening irreversible liver failure. Other transplant registries
show similar data on LT (Scientific Registry of
Transplant Recipients and OPTN Annual Data
Report 2011).
Heart and Lung Transplantation
Heart transplantation is indicated in patients
suffering from refractory cardiac failure owing
to cardiomyopathy (53.5%), coronary artery
disease (30.8%), congenital heart diseases (9%),
retransplant because of previous graft failure
(2.6%), valvular heart disease (1.4%), and for
other entities (2.7%) (International Society for
Heart and Lung Transplantation Registry 2011).
Heart transplant activity and outcomes have
greatly improved. This accounts for the growing
number of patients living with a functioning
heart transplant, which in the United States is
more than 20,000 people. Short-term graft failure (6 months and 1 year, adjusted for age, sex,
and race) has been declining over the past decade, and in general is low, 0.07 at 6 months and
0.09 at 1 year for patients who underwent transplant in 2010, and graft failure at 3, 5, and 10
years posttransplant has steadily declined. Halflife increased from 11.5 years in 1991 to 14 years
in 2009, and overall 5-year graft survival was
74.9%, and similar among all disease groups
(Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients
and OPTN Annual Data Report 2011). The
highest survival rates are observed among young
and pediatric recipients. In the United States,
graft survival for heart transplants performed
in children in 2005 was 87.5% at 6 months,
84.6% at 1 year, and 72.1% at 5 years. In these
transplant patients, for heart transplants performed in 2009 –2010, the 1-year conditional
graft half-life was 17.4 years in comparison
with 9.8 years for those performed in 1991 –

The main indication for lung transplantation is respiratory insufficiency secondary to
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (30%), emphysema/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(26%), and cystic fibrosis (14%) (International
SocietyforHeart and Lung Transplantation Registry 2011). Lung transplant activity has gradually increased. The number of adults living with
a transplanted lung was 9000 in the United States
last year, more than twofold than in 2000, and
the number of pediatric recipients has remained
stable for the last decade. In lung transplantation, a new organ allocation scheme was introduced 7 years ago, the so-called Lung Allocation
Score (LAS), which takes into account the risk
of death without transplant and posttransplant,
regardless of the waiting time, disincentivizing
early listing. This implies that “patients listed are
those with more immediate need of transplant”
(Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients and
OPTN Annual Data Report 2011). After an initial decline following the implementation of
LAS, the waiting list has steadily increased.
The LAS has increased as well, from 36.6 in
2006 to 40.8 in 2011, reflecting the increased
illness severity of candidates, which may account for the increasing mortality rates among
wait-listed candidates. LAS correlates with patient survival, being around 50% at 5 years in
recipients with LAS ,50 and reduced by 10%
in higher scores. Despite this more complex
scenario in lung transplantation and the growing number of older recipients, early and late
graft failure have diminished. Early graft failure
dropped to 5.3% in 2011, and long-term outcomes seem to have also improved, as indicated
by the increment in conditional survival of at
least 1-year adult half-life from 5.2 years in
1991 to 7.7 years in 2009. This positive evolution oflung transplantation has occurred despite
the well-identified comorbidity accompanying
lung transplant patients. Concerning pediatric
lung transplantation, the number of listed and
transplanted patients has declined the last few
years, and the highest 5-year patient survival,
around 60%, is observed in children .1 year
old,whichis reduced by 20%in patients ,1 year.
Heart –lung transplantation has remained
almost stable in the last three decades and the
major indications are congenital heart disease (35.7%), pulmonary arterial hypertension
(27.6%), and cystic fibrosis (14%) (Christie et al.
2012). According to the corresponding registries, during the last part of 2011, 106 heart –
lung transplants were performed in the United
States and 50 in Europe. The results of heart –
lung transplantation have progressively ameliorated in the last 30 years, mainly owing to the
reduction of early mortality. Recipients who
survive the first year have generally good outcomes, with a half-life of 10 years conditional
on surviving at least 1 year.
QUALITY OF LIFE AND COMORBIDITY
IN SOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION
All solid organ transplant recipients suffer from
transplant-inherent-related comorbidities, such
as hypertension, new-onset diabetes mellitus,
cardiovascular events, infections, and cancer,
and in nonrenal transplants a high percentage
of patients develop chronic kidney disease
(CKD). Despite these limitations, solid organ
transplants increase life expectancy and generally improve quality of life.
In a systematic review of clinically relevant
outcomes in adult kidney transplantation compared with dialysis, in addition to the reduction
of mortality, renal transplantation compared
with dialysis reduced cardiac events, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, hospitalization,
and hospitalization for infection (Tonelli et al.
2011). A quality of life analysis using the SF-36
also significantly favored transplantation. In
another study (Wyld et al. 2012) on patients
with advanced CKD on utility-based (0 represents death and 1 full health) quality of life,
transplant patients had a mean utility of 0.82,
which was 0.11 lower in dialysis patients and
0.20 lower in patients under conservative therapy. Interestingly, mean utility in transplant patients increased from 0.66 in the 1980s to 0.85
in the 2000s. The growing number of elderly
transplant candidates with poorer clinical conditions than young patients, challenges solid organ transplant programs, and data on quality of
life in older patients are scarce (Kniepeiss et al.
2012).

Despite that the quality of life in pediatric
renal transplant patients is slightly lower than in
the general population, and school attendance
and performance is also lower, employment
rates in adulthood are similar to the general
population (Dehennault 2011). However, in LT,
young adults still have physical and psychological sequelae that affect health status two decades after transplantation (Mohammad et al.
2012). Employment rate may also reflect quality
of life in transplant recipients. Unfortunately,
labor insertion in solid organ transplanted patients is usually lower than in the general population, and some studies have reported employment rates ,50% (Kristen et al. 2010; Huda
et al. 2012). Social coordinated efforts should
be made to reintroduce transplant patients to
labor life.
CONCLUSIONS
Solid organ transplantations save lives in patients affected by terminal organ failures and
improve quality of life. Solid organ transplant
programs provide excellent results in children
and young adults and are increasingly challenged
by the expanding proportion of elderly transplant patients. Solid organ transplant program
activity has been growing in the last two decades,
and is essential for developed and mature health
care systems.
