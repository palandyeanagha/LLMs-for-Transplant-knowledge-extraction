Although it has been reported that chronic kidney disease exacerbates sarcopenia progression, the 
mechanisms of the process remain unclear. Fifty-one patients who underwent renal transplantation 
at our hospital since 1998 (31 males and 20 females; aged 29–52 years at the time of transplantation) 
were retrospectively examined for the relationships among the psoas muscle index (PMI), 
intramuscular adipose tissue content (IMAC), serum adiponectin fractions (high-/low-molecularweight) and new-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT). Before transplantation, age 
at kidney transplantation negatively correlated with PMI and positively correlated with IMAC 
(rS= − 0.427, p< 0.01; rS= 0.464, p< 0.01, respectively). Both at 1 and 5 years after transplantation, 
PMI was higher than before transplantation (p< 0.01). IMAC transiently decreased to − 0.39 
at 1 year after kidney transplantation but subsequently increased to − 0.36 at 5 years after kidney 
transplantation. Multivariate analyses revealed that the mean increase in high-molecular weight 
adiponectin concentrations was an exacerbating factor for the mean change in PMI (p= 0.003). 
Moreover, the mean increases in IMAC were exacerbating factors for NODAT. In conclusion, the increase 
in the PMI is associated with high–molecular weight adiponectin levels after renal transplantation.
Sarcopenia is defned as loss of the mass, strength, and function of skeletal muscles1
. It is associated with not only 
a decline in the activities of daily living and falls, which results in the need for long-term care, but also with an 
increase in mortality and is a signifcant clinical and social problem in the developed countries2
. Sarcopenia is 
classifed into primary sarcopenia and secondary sarcopenia3
. Primary sarcopenia is an age-associated decrease 
in muscle mass, whereas secondary sarcopenia is a decrease in muscle mass associated with a reduced activity 
level, malnutrition, organ failure, invasion and diseases, including cancer. Terefore, contributing factors for 
secondary sarcopenia should be considered in the same way as ageing. Metabolic acidosis and the increased 
expression of angiotensin II have been shown to decrease muscle mass in patients with chronic kidney disease, 
particularly patients on dialysis4,5
. However, studies on sarcopenia in patients with kidney transplantation are 
very few. Although sarcopenia is a clinically important manifestation, it is difcult to objectively evaluate its 
progression. As the quantity and quality of skeletal muscle is an essential component for sarcopenia, we focused 
on psoas muscle images on computed tomography (CT). Hamaguchi et al. reported that a decrease in muscle 
mass, expressed as the psoas muscle index (PMI), was related to the mortality rate afer transplantation6
. Muscle 
quality has recently been attracting attention, and the fatty degeneration of muscle has been associated with 
ageing and muscle weakness7
 as well as with the development of diabetes mellitus8. Kitajima et al. evaluated the 
fatty generation of muscle according to the intramuscular adipose tissue content (IMAC) by abdominal CT9
. 
Terefore, we used PMI and IMAC as sarcopenia markers in this study.
A wide variety of cytokines, called myokines, are secreted from skeletal muscle cells. Adiponectin (ADPN) 
is a member of myokines and is also secreted from fat cells. Tere are complex regulating mechanisms involved

in ADPN secretion and crosstalk with efector cells. ADPN exerts anti-atherosclerotic, anti-diabetic and antiinfammatory efects10 and also plays some roles in muscle fbre remodelling and fat cell metabolisms. Moreover, it is reported that ADPN expression levels are decreased under the condition of increasing infammatory 
cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-611. Terefore, crosstalk between muscle and fat cells by ADPN is speculated 
as a possible pathogenic mechanism of sarcopenia12. In addition, our previous study indicated that there was 
a strong negative correlation between serum high-molecular weight (HMW) ADPN concentrations and renal 
function13. Terefore, the fraction of ADPN is an important factor in these analyses. In addition to infammatory processes, ADPN may contribute in cellular metabolism. It also plays a role in the onset of diabetes. ADPN 
increases the number of intramuscular mitochondria and enhances their function in skeletal muscles through 
ADPN receptor 1 signalling pathways14. In kidney transplantation, ischaemic stress in kidney induces various 
kinds of infammatory processes. Additionally, steroid is one of the key immunosuppressive drugs for kidney 
transplantation, but it afects new onset diabetes. Although some ADPN fractions are speculated to play critical 
roles in the onset or progression of sarcopenia and newly onset diabetes, detailed studies on ADPN and sarcopenia in kidney transplantation are few.
In this study, we examined muscle mass and fatty degeneration as sarcopenia markers and evaluated relationships between these factors and serum ADPN levels. We found that HMW-ADPN levels indicate increase of 
muscle mass until 5 years afer kidney transplantation.
Results
Baseline characteristics of patients classifed according to sexes. Te clinical characteristics of 
31 male and 20 female patients at the beginning of observations (before transplantation) are shown in Table 1. 
Although no diference was observed in age between the gender at transplantation or duration of dialysis, body 
mass index (BMI) and serum albumin was higher in males. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were controlled. 
No diference was observed in the total cholesterol (T Chol), TG or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(non-HDL-C) levels between the gender. IMAC for assessing muscle fat change wash higher in female (p<0.01) 
and PMI was higher in males (p<0.01). No signifcant diference in gender was observed in medication both 
before and afer transplantation.
Relationships between muscle imaging data (PMI and IMAC) and clinical factors (duration of 
dialysis and age at transplantation) before transplantation. Te relationships between muscle 
imaging data (PMI and IMAC) and clinical factors (duration of dialysis and age at transplantation) are shown 
in Fig. 1. PMI before transplantation did not correlate with the duration of dialysis but negatively correlated 
with age at transplantation (rS=− 0.427, p<0.01). IMAC before transplantation positively correlated with the

Changes in PMI and IMAC and after kidney transplantation. Changes in PMI and IMAC afer transplantation are shown in Fig. 2. Te median of PMI was 3.03 before transplantation and signifcantly increased to 
3.36 and 3.58 at 1 and 5 years afer transplantation, respectively (1 year, p<0.001; 5 years, p<0.001). Te median 
of IMAC was − 0.37 before transplantation and signifcantly decreased to − 0.39 1 year afer transplantation 
(p<0.01). However, IMAC increased to − 0.36 5 years afer transplantation.
Relationship between changes in ADPN and PMI after kidney transplantation. HMW-ADPN, 
middle-molecular-weight (MMW)-ADPN and low-molecular-weight (LMW)-ADPN concentrations were 
5.17±2.82, 1.97±0.69 and 3.73±1.12 μg/mL, respectively, at 1 year afer kidney transplantation, and 5.61±3.61, 
2.06±0.82 and 3.68±1.26 μg/mL, respectively, at 5 years afer kidney transplantation. Te serum levels of ADPN 
fractions were stable, showing no marked diference between 1 and 5  years afer kidney transplantation. In 
addition, the relationships between serum HMW-ADPN concentrations and PMI at 1 and 5 years afer kidney 
transplantation are shown in Fig. 3. HMW-ADPN negatively correlated with PMI at 1 and 5 years afer kidney 
transplantation (rS=− 0.373, p=0.007 and rS=− 0.308, p=0.028, respectively). Te mean change in serum 
HMW-ADPN levels within 4 years from 1 to 5 years afer kidney transplantation negatively correlated with the 
mean change in PMI during the 4 years (rS=− 0.296, p=0.034). Furthermore, multiple regression analysis of 
the factors causing changes in PMI identifed the increase in HMW-ADPN as a factor for the decrease in PMI 
(Table 3). Te mean change in estimated glomerular fltration rate (eGFR) within 4 years from 1 to 5 years afer 
kidney transplantation negatively correlated with the mean change in LMW-ADPN concentrations (rS=− 0.362, 
p=0.009). 
Relationships among the development of new onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT), 
PMI and IMAC. No signifcant diferences were observed regarding changes in PMI between non-NODAT 
and NODAT patients, whereas IMAC was signifcantly higher in NODAT patients ([3B]: p=0.008). Multiple 
logistic analysis revealed that increases in IMAC and HMW-ADPN were exacerbating factors (Table 4).
Discussion
Tis long-term retrospective cohort study clearly showed that serum ADPN concentrations play important roles 
the muscle mass and fatty degeneration of muscles afer kidney transplantation. Muscle mass gradually increased 
and the fatty degeneration of muscles was reversed in kidney transplant recipients afer transplantation. Furthermore, an increase in HMW-ADPN concentrations was identifed as a factor contributing to decrease in PMI. In 
addition, increases in PMI and IMAC were exacerbating factors for the development of NODAT.

We observed that PMI increased afer kidney transplantation, and this fnding indicates that sarcopenia 
was improved by kidney transplantation. Frailty is observed in approximately 42% of dialysis patients and has 
been identifed as a risk factor that increases the hospitalisation rate by 1.43-fold and mortality rate by 2.6-fold, 
independent of age and complications15,16. Increases in infammatory cytokines, an imbalance in muscle protein 
synthesis/degradation, reduced physical activity, an insufcient nutritional intake, metabolic acidosis, vitamin D 
defciency, insulin resistance, excessive myostatin expression, increases in intramuscular angiotensin and decrease 
and dysfunction in satellite cells have been suggested as factors involved in the development of sarcopenia in 
chronic kidney disease patients17. Dialysis patients have a high risk of developing sarcopenia due to ageing 
and progressing uremic sarcopenia with prolonged dialysis. However, some of these risk factors are removed 
by kidney transplantation. It has been reported that 23–73% of dialysis patients sufer from malnutrition18. 
Furthermore, a decreased physical activity level is an important factor in the development of sarcopenia19. 
Patients undergoing dialysis are also at a higher risk of sarcopenia due to the loss of proteins and amino acids 
into the dialysis solution20. Increased muscle mass following kidney transplantation may be attributed to an 
increased level of physical activity, as well as increased protein intake without any loss of proteins that would

otherwise occur during dialysis. We herein objectively demonstrated that PMI, which refects muscle mass, clearly 
increased, and IMAC, which refects muscle quality, was maintained for a long time afer kidney transplantation.
Fat cells that have the ability to secrete hormones secrete anti-infammatory cytokines, such as ADPN 
and leptin, as well as pro-infammatory cytokines such as PAI-1, IL-6, and TNF-α. Among these cytokines, 
TNF-α and IL-6 are known to promote sarcopenia21. Studies also suggest that with aging, the serum ADPN 
concentration increases from adulthood while skeletal muscle mass peaks around adulthood and decreases 
gradually22. Previous studies also demonstrated that ADPN and AdipoR1 regulate the expression and activation 
of PPARγcoactivator-1α [PCG-1α], a key component of sarcopenia, by Ca2+ signalling, AMP-activated protein 
kinase (AMPK), and SIRT1. Tus, there is an increasing interest in the role of ADPN and AdipoR1 in the regulation of skeletal muscle fbers23. We also revealed that an increase in HMW-ADPN concentrations was identifed as 
a factor contributing to decrease in PMI. In the present study, a negative correlation was observed between serum 
ADPN concentrations and muscle mass, a marker of sarcopenia. Although this fnding seems to confict with 
previous reports, similar observation was also reported. Tere was a signifcant inverse correlation between serum 
adiponectin levels with arm lean mass and muscle strength in patients with HF24. In addition, muscle weakness 
in the limbs was reported to be related to an increase in serum ADPN concentrations in elderly patients and leg 
muscle strength inversely correlated with blood ADPN concentrations in patients aged≥70 years25. A previous 
study confrmed that the percentage of type IIB muscle fbres increased in ADPN knockout mice26, and an epidemiological study on 461 elderly subjects showed that IIB fbres were reduced in those with high blood ADPN 
concentrations27. In addition, a recent study showed that administration of AdipoRon, an adiponectin receptor 
agonist, increases blood ADPN concentrations and induces atrophy of type II muscle fbres via the adiponectin 
receptor 1-AMP-dependent protein kinase signal pathway in mice28. Since the present study found a negative 
correlation between blood levels of HMW-ADPN and the cross-sectional area of the greater psoas muscle, the 
muscle fbres that correlated with ADPN may be primarily type II muscle fbres. Collectively, these fndings and 
the present results suggest that muscles of kidney transplant patients would similarly react to HMW-ADPN as 
aged cases. HMW-ADPN exerts diferent efects on diferent muscle fbre types, i.e. HMW-ADPN increases the 
percentage of type I fbres but decreases that of type II fbres, as the mechanism of action of ADPN in sarcopenia.
Our study showed that increases in IMAC were exacerbating factors for the development of NODAT. Since 
the mass of muscle, a target organ of insulin, decreases in sarcopenia, patients with sarcopenia have insulin 
resistance. In obese patients with sarcopenia (sarcopenic obesity), blood levels of IL-6 and CRP are elevated, 
and these factors lead to an increase in insulin resistance and decrease in skeletal muscle mass29, 30. Tis would 
be a vicious cycle in sarcopenic obesity. Moreover, insulin also stimulates protein synthesis. Terefore, skeletal muscle synthesis may be suppressed in diabetic patients, and leg neuropathy has been strongly implicated 
in muscle weakness31. Landi et al. reported that sarcopenia and diabetes may be interrelated via factors such 
as insulin resistance, infammatory cytokines and mitochondrial hypofunction32. Furthermore, in addition to 
subcutaneous and visceral fat, ectopic fat, called the third fat, is now being investigated. Akima et al. showed 
that the accumulation of fat in the muscles of elderly individuals was related to sarcopenia and impaired motor 
function33, and a decline in mitochondrial function and fat accumulation in muscles has been suggested to 
increase insulin resistance34. Although the state of uremic sarcopenia is ameliorated and muscle mass increases 
afer kidney transplantation, serial increases in IMAC, i.e. the progression of the fatty degeneration of muscles, 
are considered to be involved in the development of NODAT. Terefore, the preservation of not only muscle 
mass, but also muscle quality are important for the prevention of NODAT.
Te limitations of the present study include (1) the small number of subjects, (2) its retrospective design, and 
(3) evaluation limited to muscle mass of the greater psoas and multifdus muscles. Further studies are warranted 
to examine other muscles, such as the extensor digitorum longus muscle, which is reported to have a high content 
of type II muscle fbres and to investigate diferences among muscles in the same individuals. We also intend to 
perform a prospective study, extend the observation period and examine relationships with the prognoses of 
and cardiovascular complications in these patients.
Conclusion
Our study showed that PMI gradually increased and IMAC decreased afer kidney transplantation. Te increase 
in PMI was associated with HMW-ADPN levels afer kidney transplantation, which indicates its involvement 
in the development of NODAT in renal allograf recipients. Terefore, sufcient exercise therapy is also considered to be necessary afer transplantation to preserve skeletal muscle mass and prevent the fatty degeneration 
of muscle.
Methods
Patients. Fify-one patients who underwent kidney transplantation since 1998 at our hospital and showed 
stable renal function for at least 6 months thereafer (40 recipients from living donors and 11 recipients from 
deceased donors; 31 males and 20 females) were retrospectively examined. Te causes of renal failure in the 
transplant patients were chronic glomerulonephritis (n=35), purpura nephritis (n=3), membranoproliferative 
glomerulonephritis (n=3), hypoplasia (n=3), nephrosclerosis (n=3), polycystic kidney disease (n=2), focal 
segmental glomerulosclerosis (n=1), refux nephropathy (n=1). Since the time required for the stabilisation of 
kidney graf functions difers between kidney transplant recipients from living donors and those from deceased 
donors, the changes in serum ADPN fractions within 4 years from 1 to 5 years afer transplantation were investigated in the present study.
Te relationship between skeletal muscle masses evaluated by PMI 1 and 5 years afer transplantation and 
the serum levels of ADPN fractions (HMW, MMW and LMW fractions) were assessed as the primary endpoint.

the serum levels of ADPN fractions and changes in PMI and IMAC afer transplantation and among NODAT, 
PMI, IMAC and serum ADPN fractions were investigated as the secondary endpoints.
Te following clinical factors were evaluated: age at transplantation, gender, duration of dialysis, blood pressure at 1 and 5 years afer transplantation, BMI, serum creatinine (SCr), eGFR, serum albumin, T chol, HDL-C, 
non-HDL-C (T chol-HDL-C), ADPN fractions (HMW, MMW and LMW), types of immunosuppressants used, 
statins and anti-hypertensive agents.
Te present study did not include any vulnerable populations, such as prisoners, subjects with reduced mental 
capacity due to illness or age or children. Furthermore, we used blood samples, radiological scans and renal 
biopsy specimens. Te study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kanazawa Medical University 
(Kanazawa Medical University Epidemiological Study Review No. I293). All patients provided written informed 
consent, and the study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Istanbul.
Measurement methods. Serum levels of total HMW-, MMW- and LMW-ADPN were measured using a 
sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (SEKISUI MEDICAL Co., Tokyo, Japan). Renal function was 
evaluated based on eGFR [194×SCr−1.094 × age−0.287 (×0.739 for females), mL/min/1.73 m2
]. eGFR was calculated 
based on patient SCr levels, as described previously35.
Imaging analysis. Te skeletal muscle mass index proposed by Prado et al., calculated by dividing total 
skeletal muscle mass at the L3 level by the square of height, is a typical index for evaluating skeletal muscle mass 
by CT36. Evaluation method of CT image are shown in SI Fig. S1. we calculated PMI (cm2
/m2) as the crosssectional area of the greater psoas muscle (cm2
)/height2 (m2) using image analysis sofware (MITANI Co., Ltd., 
Fukui, Japan) and examined regions of interest (ROI) in the bilateral greater psoas muscles in a slice of abdominal CT at the L3 level. IMAC was measured using AZE Virtual Place (AZE Co., Ltd., Kanagawa, Japan) and setting ROIs over the bilateral multifdus muscles in a slice of abdominal CT at the L3 level. Moreover, ROIs were 
set in 4 areas of subcutaneous fat distant from the large vessels, and the mean CT value of the multifdus muscle/
mean CT value of the subcutaneous fat region in the back was calculated and evaluated.
Statistical analyses. All continuous variables are expressed as median values and interquartile ranges. 
Comparisons between sexes were made using the Mann–Whitney test. Te relationships between PMI and 
IMAC before transplantation, duration of dialysis and age at transplantation as well as between the mean change 
in eGFR and mean change in serum ADPN levels were examined according to Spearman’s rank correlation coeffcient. Changes in PMI and IMAC afer transplantation were evaluated using Dunn’s test. Factors afecting PMI 
and IMAC before transplantation and those afecting mean changes in serum HMW-ADPN levels and PMI were 
analysed using multiple regression analysis. In addition, factors that afected the development of posttransplant 
diabetes mellitus were assessed by multiple logistic regression analysis. Te statistical sofware Stat Flex Ver6 
(Artech Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) was used for analyses.
