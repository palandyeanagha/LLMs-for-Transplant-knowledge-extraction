Abstract
Summary This study investigated the relationship between muscle and bone status in elderly individuals. Our results suggested
links between sarcopenia and osteoporosis; impairment in muscle status (i.e., muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical
performance) is associated with deterioration in bone mass and texture subsequently leading to an increased risk of fracture.
Introduction Accumulating evidence has shown associations between sarcopenia and osteoporosis, but existing studies face
inconsistencies in the clinical definition of both conditions. Thus, we sought to investigate bone health among older individuals
with or without muscle health impairment.
Methods We conducted an analysis of cross-sectional data available from the Sarcopenia and Physical Impairment with
Advancing Age (SarcoPhAge) study. Sarcopenia was diagnosed according to the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in
Older People (EWGSOP) (i.e., a low muscle mass plus either low muscle strength or low physical performance). Muscle mass
and areal bone mineral density (aBMD) were determined using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Muscle strength was
assessed using a hand dynamometer, and physical performance was assessed with the Short Physical Performance Battery test.
Using the cutoff limits proposed by the EWGSOP, we have classified women in the Blow SMI group^ when its value was <
5.50 kg/m2
, in the Blow muscle strength group^ when strength was < 20 kg, and in the Blow physical performance group^ when
SPPB < 8 points. The thresholds of < 7.26 kg/m2 (for SMI), < 30 kg (for muscle strength), and SPPB < 8 points were used for
men. The 10-year fracture risk was obtained using the FRAX® tool. Moreover, bone texture was determined using the trabecular
bone score (TBS) method.
Results The study sample consisted of 288 older subjects aged 74.7 ± 5.7 years, and 59.0% of the subjects were women.
Sarcopenia was diagnosed in 43 individuals (14.9%), and osteoporosis was diagnosed in 36 subjects (12.5%). Moreover,
aBMD values were, most of the time, lower in older men and women with muscle impairment (i.e., low muscle mass, low
muscle strength, and low physical performance). For these subjects, we also noted a higher probability of fracture. When
comparing bone quality, there were no significant differences in the TBS values between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic older
men and women or between those with low and high muscle mass. However, when controlling for confounders (i.e., age, BMI,
number of co-morbidities, smoking status, and nutritional status), TBS values were lower in older women with low muscle
strength (p = 0.04) and in older men with low physical performance (p = 0.01).
Conclusions Our study showed interrelationships between components of sarcopenia and osteoporosis, with older subjects with
muscle impairment having poorer bone health.

Introduction
During the senescence process, there is an increase in functional disability, which induces a higher risk of falls and fractures and predisposes older individuals to increased morbidity
and mortality. These adverse health events may be related in
part to the progressive wasting of muscle and bone tissue
giving rise to sarcopenia and osteoporosis. The prevalence

of the two disorders is expected to grow [1, 2] due to the
increase in life expectancy responsible for major public health
issues and significant healthcare costs.
There are striking relationships between sarcopenia and
osteoporosis [3] leading to similar health consequences (e.g.,
falls and fracture). They also share putative etiological factors
such as mechanical and functional influences, genetic aspects,
nutritional disorders, chronic inflammation, lifestyle habits,
and hormonal changes [4–6]. When one of the two tissues is
subjected to the aging process, the functionality of the other
seems to be prejudiced.
Many studies have provided evidence of a link between
muscle and bone mass [7], but few have assessed the relationship between muscle and bone status or sarcopenia and osteoporosis. Moreover, the measurement methods and the definition of the two conditions are heterogeneous. In the case of
sarcopenia, some studies defined the disease based on low
muscle mass alone [8–12], but a growing consensus advocates
for sarcopenia to be defined additionally on the basis of decreased muscle strength and/or impaired physical function
[13, 14]. The definition of osteoporosis implies a decrease in
bone mass and a deterioration of bone architecture. However,
its operational definition is limited to the assessment of bone
mineral density (BMD) with a reference standard at the femoral neck [15]. The evaluation of BMD as a prognostic tool
lacks sensitivity to predict fracture over most reasonable assumptions [16]. However, there are other tools for assessing
individual fracture risk. The FRAX® tool [17] allows the
input of a set of clinical risk factors that affect fracture risk
and provides a 10-year osteoporosis-related fracture probability with or without the inclusion of BMD. Additionally, trabecular bone score (TBS) is a new and non-invasive medical
imaging technique that has been recently suggested to provide
a measure of bone quality [18]. It reflects an index of bone
texture derived from the analysis of two-dimensional lumbar
spine bone densitometry images, and it captures a component
of fracture risk that is independent of BMD [19].
The aim of the present study was to further characterize the
relationships between sarcopenia and markers of skeletal fragility (i.e., BMD, FRAX and TBS) in a cohort of older subjects with a range of muscular disabilities (i.e., sarcopenia,
decreased muscle mass, impaired muscle strength, and impaired physical performance).
Methods
Population
The present study is based on cross-sectional data obtained
from the Sarcopenia and Physical Impairment with advancing
Age (SarcoPhAge) study, which is an ongoing, prospective
study that enrolled a convenience sample of 534
community-dwelling older subjects with the main objective
of assessing the health and functional outcomes of sarcopenia.
Methodological details of the study and baseline characteristics of the SarcoPhAge population have been previously described [20]. During the second year of follow-up (October
2015 to October 2016), we conducted additional investigations into skeletal status including BMD, FRAX, and TBS.
Several subjects (n = 218) were not interviewed for the following reasons: physical or mental inability (n = 66), death (n =
22), refusal to participate again (n = 113), or inability to contact them (n = 17). A total of 316 consenting participants were
then identified as being available for this ancillary analysis.
Among them, individuals who had spinal surgery were excluded (n = 22), as along with those who had a body mass
index (BMI) > 35 kg/m2 (n = 6) because a BMI beyond this
threshold affects the accuracy of TBS [21]. The final sample
size available for analysis comprised 288 individuals.
Compared with the current sample, those excluded from the
analysis were significantly older (p < 0.001) and had lower
physical performance (p < 0.001) at the previous assessment.
All subjects were informed about the study objectives and
procedures. Informed written consent was given by all participants, and the research protocol and subsequent amendments
were approved by the Ethics Committee of the University
Teaching Hospital of Liège.
Health examination
Clinical measurements
During the examination, subjects wore light cotton clothes
without any jewelry, buttons, or metal objects and without
shoes. Body weight and body height were measured using
standardized scales to the nearest 0.1 kg and 0.1 cm, respectively. BMI was calculated as weight divided by height
squared (kg/m2
). Subjects were also asked to list all comorbidities and all current medications. Smoking status
(yes/no) and the daily consumption of 3 or more units of
alcohol (yes/no) were also noted. The nutritional status of
individuals was assessed by the Mini-Nutritional
Assessment (MNA) [22]. The evaluation was scored on a
30-point scale. Subjects were classified as Bwell-nourished^
when the score was equal to 24 points or more; those presenting with a score below 24 points were classified as Bat risk of
malnutrition or malnutrition.^
Muscle assessment
The skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) was determined by
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (Hologic
Discovery A, USA) and calibrated daily in accordance with
the manufacturer’s recommendations. The SMI was
1058 Osteoporos Int (2018) 29:1057–1067

calculated as appendicular skeletal muscle mass (i.e., sum of
the muscle mass in both arms and legs) divided by height
squared. Muscle strength was assessed as hand grip strength
using a hand dynamometer (Saehan Corporation, MSD
Europe Bvba, Belgium) calibrated each year. Participants
had to grip the device as hard as possible three times in each
hand; the highest of the six values was recorded [23]. Physical
performance was evaluated by the short physical performance
battery (SPPB) test (12 points) [24].
Sarcopenia was diagnosed according to the European
Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP)
definition, comprising low muscle mass plus either low muscle strength and/or low physical performance [13]. To determine muscle impairment, we used the cutoff limits proposed
by the EWGSOP [13], classifying women in the Blow SMI
group^ when the value was < 5.50 kg/m2
, the Blow muscle
strength group^ when the strength was < 20 kg, and the Blow
physical performance group^ when SPPB < 8 points. The
thresholds of < 7.26 kg/m2 (for SMI), < 30 kg (for muscle
strength), and < 8 points (for physical performance) were used
for men.
Skeletal assessment
DXA scans to measure areal BMD (aBMD) were performed
using the Hologic Discovery A device at three sites: lumbar
spine (L2–L4), total hip, and femoral neck. The results of bone
densitometry were expressed in grams per centimeter and as a
T-score (sex-specific and derived from the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey III normative data for hip
sites and from the manufacturer’s reference range for the lumbar spine). Osteoporosis was defined as an aBMD T-score ≤−
2.5 on at least one of the three regions, and osteopenia was
defined as an aBMD T-score between − 1 and − 2.5 [15]. Note
that the femoral neck aBMD T-score is currently recommended as a reference standard [15]. Thus, we also reported the
prevalence of osteoporosis using this criterion. The 10-year
probability of major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) and hip fracture (HF) was determined using the Belgian version of the
FRAX tool [25] (including aBMD measurement). We classified participants as having a high or a low 10-year probability
of MOF according to the National Osteoporosis Guideline
Group (NOGG) [26], calculated. Ten subjects with a hip prosthesis did not undergo DXA hip scans: we performed statistical analysis by including the maximum number of observations available in this case (n = 278) and, therefore, the FRAX
probabilities (which includes hip aBMD measurement) were
not established for 10 subjects. TBS values were calculated
from the lumbar spine BMD using TBS iNsight® software
(Medimaps Group, Geneva, Switzerland, version 3.0.1). The
TBS technique provides an index of bone texture by analyzing
gray-level variation in the DXA image. It reflects bone texture
and subsequently bone strength [27]. A low TBS value
reflects a poorer quality and fracture-prone bone
microarchitecture and, conversely, a high TBS value is correlated with better, more fracture-resistant bone microstructure
[19].
Statistical analyses
Statistical analysis was performed using Statistica® software
(Dell Statistica, USA, version 13). The results are expressed as
the means ± standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables
and as absolute (n) and relative (%) frequencies for categorical
variables. The distribution of the different variables was tested
using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Student’s t test was used to test
differences between groups in aBMD, FRAX® probabilities,
and TBS values. Because bone and muscle variables are markedly different between men and women, analyses were performed separately. Differences in the proportions were compared using χ2 tests. To assess the association between two
conditions, odds ratios (OR) were reported with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). To analyze the effect of several
covariates on muscle health, stepwise logistic regression analysis was applied with adjustments for age, BMI, number of
co-morbidities, smoking status, and nutritional status (model
1). These covariates were included in the multivariable model
because they significantly differed between groups in the univariate analysis for at least one of the muscle measurements.
To avoid over-adjustment, we only considered the number of
co-morbidities in the model, because of collinearity between
the number of co-morbidities and the number of drugs consumed. We also did not integrate alcohol consumption as a
covariate because consumption was similar between the
groups. To explore whether bone density is associated with
bone texture, three further models, in addition to model 1,
were developed for the TBS values. A second model (model
2) was additionally adjusted for lumbar spine aBMD.
Sensitivity analysis was also performed using two other
models: additional adjustment for total hip aBMD (model 3)
and additional adjustment for femoral neck aBMD (model 4).
To limit the loss of information that occurs when variables are
treated dichotomously, a multivariable linear regression was
also carried out with muscle measurements as continuous variables, including various potential explanatory variables: age,
number of co-morbidities, smoking status, nutritional status,
femoral neck aBMD, and TBS value. Two-tailed p values <
0.05 indicated a statistically significant association.
Results
Characteristics of the subjects studied
We studied 288 individuals aged 74.7 ± 5.7 years. The sample
comprised 170 women (59.0%). A summary of baseline
Osteoporos Int (2018) 29:1057–1067 1059

characteristics is given in Table 1. Of the 288 participants, 43
(14.9%) were diagnosed with sarcopenia, 81 (21.8%) had a
low SMI, 98 (34.0%) showed weakness in muscle strength,
and 57 (19.8%) had poor physical performance (Table 1).
Some differences in clinical characteristics were observed between individuals with and without sarcopenia (i.e.,
sarcopenic subjects had higher age, higher prevalence of
smoking habits, and poorer nutritional status), between individuals with a low SMI and those with a normal SMI (i.e.,
subjects with low SMI had a higher prevalence of smoking
and poorer nutritional status), between participants presenting
with poor and normal muscle strength (i.e., subjects with
weakness in muscle strength had higher age, more co-morbidities, more drugs consumed, and poorer nutritional status), and
between individuals with a decreased or normal physical performance (i.e., subjects with poor physical performance had
higher age, more co-morbidities, more drugs consumed, and
poorer nutritional status).
Relationship between sarcopenia and bone health
Among the 288 participants, 43 (14.9%) were diagnosed with
sarcopenia (34.9% men, 65.1% women), and 36 (12.5%) were
diagnosed with osteoporosis as judged by the minimum Tscore at the three sites of aBMD measurements (22.2% men,
77.8% women) (Fig. 1). The prevalence of both sarcopenia
and osteoporosis was 4.5% (Fig. 1). As shown in Table 2, a
significantly higher prevalence of sarcopenia was found in
subjects with deteriorated bone health. Indeed, there was a
significantly higher number of people with sarcopenia among
osteoporotic subjects or those with a high MOF probability
(the latter also had osteopenia or were osteoporotic more often). Conversely, there was a higher number of osteoporotic or
osteopenic individuals (including osteoporotic ones) with
muscle impairment. Sarcopenic subjects had a 4-fold higher
risk of having co-existing osteoporosis compared with nonsarcopenic individuals (OR = 4.18; 95% CI 1.92–9.12). When
osteoporosis was defined using the femoral neck aBMD Tscore alone, the prevalence of the condition rose to 9.0%
(3.4% of men, 12.9% of women). Sarcopenic individuals
had a 4.34 times higher chance of having osteoporosis
(defined by the femoral neck aBMD T-score) when compared
with non-sarcopenic subjects (OR = 4.34; 95% CI 1.82–
10.36). Finally, we also noted that the prevalence of previous
self-reported fracture occurring in adult life (no matter the site)
was significantly higher in subjects presenting sarcopenia.
Skeletal status in sarcopenic subjects versus
non-sarcopenic subjects
With regard to skeletal status in older men (Table 3), significantly higher MOF and HF fracture probabilities were
observed in sarcopenic men, also after adjustments. All
other bone variables were decreased in sarcopenic men,
but this did not reach statistical significance (all p > 0.05).
For older women, aBMD values at two of the three sites
(i.e., lumbar spine and total hip) were significantly lower
in sarcopenic subjects than in non-sarcopenic subjects
(when adjusting for age, number of co-morbidities,
smoking status, and nutritional status). Compared with
non-sarcopenic subjects, we also observed that sarcopenic
women had, after adjustments, a significantly higher fracture probability of major osteoporosis-related fracture and
hip fracture. Regarding bone texture, there were statistically significant differences in TBS values between
sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic subjects in the univariate
analysis but not in the multivariate analysis. Additionally,
when we performed further adjustments of TBS for lumbar spine aBMD (model 2), total hip aBMD (model 3),
and femoral neck aBMD (model 4), we found no significant difference between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic
subjects in terms of TBS value (p = 0.25, 0.16, 0.18, respectively). In the multivariate model, nutritional status
was significantly associated with sarcopenia (p = 0.001):
risk of malnutrition or malnutrition was more prevalent
among subjects with sarcopenia.
Skeletal status in subjects with low SMI versus
subjects with adequate SMI
In older men, lower total hip aBMD was observed in
subjects with low SMI as well as increased probabilities
of fracture (adjusted p = 0.01) (Table 3). Other bone parameters, although lower in men with low SMI, do not
differ significantly from those with adequate SMI (all
p > 0.05). In older women, lower aBMD values for two
of three sites (i.e., total hip and femoral neck) were noted
in the low SMI group than in individuals with an adequate
SMI (Table 4). Significantly higher major osteoporotic
and hip fracture probabilities were also noted in those
with low SMI. However, no significant difference was
observed in TBS values in subjects with low SMI versus
subjects with higher SMI when adjusting for covariates.
Further adjustments of TBS values following models 2, 3,
and 4 also demonstrated that there was no significant association between TBS value and SMI (p = 0.36, 0.78,
0.26, respectively). The logistic model showed that nutritional and smoking status as along with total hip aBMD
were associated with weaker SMI (p = 0.01, 0.03, and
0.02, respectively).
Skeletal status in subjects with or without weakness
in muscle strength
We observed, in older men with impaired muscle strength,
significantly lower femoral neck aBMD compared to those
1060 Osteoporos Int (2018) 29:1057–1067

with normal muscle strength (Table 3). Moreover, significantly increased MOF and HF fracture probabilities were found
(p < 0.05). Compared with older women with good muscle
strength, we found significantly lower total hip and femoral
neck aBMD, higher fracture risk, and lower TBS values in
women with weakness in muscle strength (Table 4).
Regarding the TBS value, the difference remained significant
when adjusted for age, number of co-morbidities, smoking
status, and nutritional status (model 1) (p = 0.04). However,
the difference was not evident when also adjusting for lumbar
spine aBMD (model 2) (p = 0.47). This observation was similar when adjusting for total hip and femoral neck aBMD
(models 3 and 4) (p = 0.13 and 0.36, respectively). These results showed that when aBMD was considered a covariate, the
association of the TBS values with muscle strength did not
reach the level of statistical significance. When muscle

no evident influence of the TBS value in women (coefficient
B = 4.52, p = 0.19).
Skeletal status in subjects with or without physical
performance impairment
No significant difference regarding aBMD values was found
in older men with impaired physical performance compared to
men with good physical ability (all p > 0.05). However, we
found, in this population with impaired physical performance,
a significantly higher risk of HF fracture (adjusted p = 0.04)
and a poorer bone texture (adjusted p value = 0.01). An extensive analysis showed that the significant relationship between
TBS value and an impaired physical performance remained
when adding lumbar spine aBMD as a covariate (models 2, 3,
and 4; p = 0.001, 0.006, and 0.001, respectively).
Multivariable linear regression confirmed this relationship
(coefficient B = 0.96, p = 0.03). Univariate analysis indicated
also that older women with low physical performance showed

lower hip aBMD as well as higher fracture probabilities
(Table 4). After adjusting for age, number of co-morbidities,
smoking status, and nutritional status, these differences were,
however, no longer significant. For TBS values, model 1
showed no significantly lower TBS value in subjects with
decreased physical performance. Further investigation of the
effect of the TBS value on physical performance tested as a
continuous variable however demonstrated a significant association between the two components (coefficient B = 1.73,
p = 0.01).
Discussion
Growing evidence shows that sarcopenia and osteoporosis
share many common pathways [4], and that these conditions
can be concomitantly found in a substantial number of
individuals [28, 29]. The present cross-sectional study reports
an increased proportion of sarcopenic individuals presenting
BMD values corresponding to either osteoporosis or
osteopenia. Conversely, in older participants with low BMD,
we found an increased prevalence of sarcopenia, low muscle
mass, decreased muscle strength, and impaired physical performance. We previously reported an increased risk of osteoporosis in subjects diagnosed with sarcopenia according to the
definition of the EWGSOP [9, 30], and this observation was
supported by other groups [31, 32]. However, the magnitude
of the association between osteoporosis and sarcopenia varied
between publications with reported risk increasing from 2- to
12-fold. These discrepancies are partly explained by the specificities of the investigated cohorts (e.g., age, sex, setting), but
most likely, the major determinant of such differences in the
association between the two diseases is the heterogeneity in
the selected operational definition of sarcopenia [33–35]. The

observation that low BMD is associated not only with
sarcopenia as a global entity now recognized as a disease
[36] but also with decreased values in muscle mass, strength,
and performance, independent of several clinical parameters
and lifestyle habits, is interesting. In older women, muscle
strength was correlated with BMD but, except at the trochanter site, the significances disappeared when corrected for body
weight [9]. Significant but marginal correlations between appendicular skeletal muscle mass and lumbar spine and total
hip BMD were also observed in Japanese women aged 40–
88 years [12]. In a cohort of healthy individuals, mean age
ranging from 20 to 72 years, relative appendicular skeletal
muscle mass, which includes upper and lower limb muscle
mass, was more significantly correlated with femoral neck
BMD than the relative upper limb muscle mass or the relative
leg muscle mass [37]. However, our study is the first one to
correlate BMD with all aspects of muscle mass, strength, and
performance.
The International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) FRAX
algorithm uses clinical risk factors, BMD values (optional),
and country-specific fracture and mortality data to quantify a
patient’s 10-year probability of a hip or major osteoporotic
fracture [25, 38]. Few studies assessed the relationships between muscle wasting and an increase in individual 10-year
facture probability. In a cross-sectional study of South
Chinese women, fat mass and lean mass were negatively correlated with the predicted 10-year facture probability when
FRAX included the BMD value [39]. However, the relative
weight of BMD in the prediction of fracture risk was not
assessed, and these data were not corrected for lifestyle habits
including physical exercise. Most recently, analysis of a 3-
year longitudinal study of community dwellers, with a mean

age of 65 years, showed that low lean mass predicts fractures
independently from FRAX [40], but there was no assessment
of muscle strength or performance included in the study. In
Chinese individuals, sarcopenia diagnosed according to the
Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia algorithm added incremental value to FRAX in predicting incident fracture [41, 42].
However, this feature was not confirmed in a Caucasian population, and our study is the first one to show a relationship
between fracture probability assessed by FRAX and muscle
strength or performance in both men and women.
Factors other than bone mass influence bone strength and
fracture risk. Trabecular bone score (TBS) is a novel imaging
technique [19] that appears to constitute an index of bone
architecture. TBS is not a direct measurement of bone architecture, but it is related to three-dimensional bone characteristics such as the trabecular number, the trabecular separation,
and the connectivity density [43]. Our study is the first to
investigate whether parameters reflecting muscle wasting is
associated with TBS values. Although the TBS value was
not significantly reduced in sarcopenic men and women after
adjustments, we were able to show a relationship between
muscle strength and physical performance, on the muscle side,
and TBS value. However, after adjustment for bone mass, this
relationship remained significant only in the case of physical
performance in men, and of grip strength for women. Other
investigations previously reported impaired bone texture in
older men with low muscle mass, low grip strength, or impaired physical performance [44, 45]. These papers reported
on results from the same cohort and used peripheral computed
tomography of the distal radius.
In light of these findings, the strengths and limitations of
our study should be addressed. The originality of this investigation relates to the comprehensive manner used to investigate
the relationships between sarcopenia and the skeletal status of
older subjects, with the systematic evaluation of the following
three bone components: bone quantity, bone quality, and fracture risk. Specifically, fracture risk and bone texture have
scarcely been studied in connection with muscle parameters.
To our knowledge, this is the first time that the TBS technique
was used to evaluate bone quality in sarcopenic individuals. It
allows for an in-depth analysis of the determinants of muscle
and bone health. Nevertheless, the transversal design of our
study leads to a reflective interpretation of the results. We
cannot determine whether the muscle impairment is a cause
or a consequence of the deterioration of bone health, despite
the observed relationship. Our study is prone to selection bias.
Indeed, it should be noted that the sample used for the current
study is likely composed of the healthier subjects from the
SarcoPhAge study. Our population may therefore not be fully
representative and is thus limited in its external validity.
However, the prevalence of muscle and bone impairment
found in our analysis is likely to be underestimated compared
to the true prevalence because individuals who participated in
our study still had acceptable musculoskeletal health. Our research may potentially also have uncontrolled confounding
factors inherent in any epidemiological study, and more specifically, factors related to both muscle and bone status such as
biochemical markers and physical activity.
In conclusion, we report the first study that exhaustively
investigated the relationship between muscle (mass, strength,
and performance) and bone (mass, architecture, fracture risk)
wasting. We confirmed the decrease in bone mass and muscle
mass in a subpopulation, previously called osteosarcopenic
patients [28]. We also showed, for the first time in
Caucasian individuals, that older men and women with major
muscle wasting are characterized by an increased 10-year fracture risk and that poor physical performance is linked to a
deficit in bone texture. Further longitudinal investigations
are now needed to better understand the interaction between
bone and muscle, and quantitative and qualitative loss, with
the final objective of developing therapeutic strategies that are
able to simultaneously prevent, reduce, or restore bone and
muscle age-related wasting.
