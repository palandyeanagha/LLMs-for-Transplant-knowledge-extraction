Introduction
Cardiomyopathy is a serious disease associated with high mortality and morbidity. The cause of cardiomyopathy in children is 
currently poorly understood. Only one third of children know the 
cause of their disease at the time of diagnosis, while the remaining 
two thirds are classified as idiopathic.1) Recent advances in biochemical and molecular genetic techniques have contributed to improving our understanding of the metabolic disorders causing cardiomyopathy. Inborn errors of metabolism account for only 5% of 
all pediatric cardiomyopathy, and 15% of those are due to known 
causes, but they are of particular interest to clinicians because many 
have disease-specific treatments.2)
Identification of underlying causes of cardiomyopathy with subsequent disease-specific treatments may lead to improved outcomes. Primary carnitine deficiency (PCD) is one of the treatable 
causes of cardiomyopathy since complete resolution of the heart 
disease is possible if treated early.3-5)

Carnitine is essential for the transfer of long-chain fatty acids from the cytosol into mitochondria for subsequent β-oxidation. A lack of 
carnitine results in impaired energy production from long-chain fatty acids, especially during periods of fasting or stress. Primary carnitine deficiency (PCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of mitochondrial β-oxidation resulting from defective carnitine transport and is 
one of the rare treatable etiologies of metabolic cardiomyopathies. Patients affected with the disease may present with acute metabolic 
decompensation during infancy or with severe cardiomyopathy in childhood. Early recognition of the disease and treatment with L-carnitine may be life-saving. In this review article, the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of PCD are 
discussed, with a focus on cardiac involvements. (Korean Circ J 2013;43:785-792)

In this review article, an overview of the clinical characteristics, diagnosis, treatment, and long-term outcome of PCD is provided with 
an emphasis on cardiac involvement.
Carnitine Metabolism and Fatty Acid Oxidation
Carnitine (beta-hydroxy-gamma-trimethylaminobutyric acid) is 
a naturally occurring hydrophilic amino acid derivative produced endogenously in the kidneys and liver or derived from meat and dairy 
products in the diet. In normal human omnivores (non-vegetarians), 
approximately 75% of carnitine sources come from the diet while 
the rest is provided by endogenous synthesis.6) Carnitine is eliminated via urine as free carnitine and acylcarnitines, but more than 
95% of carnitine filtered in the kidney is reabsorbed by the proximal 
tubules therefore maintaining the homeostatic balance of carnitine in the body.7)
Long-chain fatty acids are important energy substrates for the 
myocardium and other muscle tissues. However, they cannot freely 
diffuse through the mitochondrial inner membrane. Carnitine plays 
an essential role in the transfer of long-chain fatty acids into the 
mitochondria for subsequent β-oxidation (Fig. 1). Deficiency of 
carnitine blocks the mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids to carbon 
dioxide in all tissues and to ketones in the liver, and leads to lipid 
accumulation in the cytosol. Since skeletal and particularly cardiac 
muscles depend on fatty acid oxidation for most of their energy, 
these tissues can be expected to be the most severely affected by 
carnitine deficiency.4)

Clinical Carnitine Deficiency Syndrome
Two distinct carnitine deficiency states have been reported, which 
include “primary” and “secondary” carnitine deficiency.8)
Primary carnitine deficiency (OMIM 212140), also known as carnitine uptake defect, carnitine transporter deficiency or systemic carnitine deficiency, is an autosomal recessive disorder of the carnitine 
cycle that results in defective fatty acid oxidation. The incidence of 
PCD is about 1 : 40000 with an approximate carrier rate of 1%, although this frequency has been reported to be higher in the Faroe 
Islands, an isolated archipelago in the North Atlantic.9-11) The disease 
is caused by heterogeneous mutations of SLC22A5 which encodes 
the high-affinity carnitine transporter OCTN2 in the plasma membrane.12)13) OCTN2 is strongly expressed in the myocardium, skeletal 
muscle, renal tubules, fibroblasts, intestine and placental tissue.14)15)
The Na+-coupled active transport of carnitine via OCTN2 is essential 
for the maintenance of high carnitine concentrations inside cells. 
With the help of plasma membrane carnitine transporters, intracellular carnitine concentrations are maintained 20 to 50 times greater 
than those of the extracellular space. SLC22A5 mutations can affect 
carnitine transport by impairing the maturation of transporters to 
the plasma membrane. Defects of the OCNT2 transporter protein 
result in urinary carnitine wasting, low serum carnitine levels, and 
decreased intracellular carnitine accumulation.14-16) As a consequence, impaired oxidation of long chain fatty acids leads to deficient energy generation as well as reduced ketogenesis, particularly 
during fasting or stress, and accumulation of long-chain fatty acids 
in the cytoplasm of affected tissues. The presentation of affected 
patients can vary widely with respect to the age of onset and organ 
involvement, from asymptomatic to lethal cardiac manifestations. 
The clinical symptoms usually consist of episodes of hypoketotic 
hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure.
Secondary carnitine deficiencies may be hereditary or acquired. 
Secondary carnitine deficiency can be caused by a number of organic acidemias, defects of fatty acid oxidation and of the carnitine 
cycle. However, PCD is the only genetic defect in which carnitine 
deficiency is the cause, rather than the consequence.17) Carnitine 
deficiency can also be acquired as a result of liver disease, renal disease (Fanconi syndrome, renal tubular acidosis), premature birth, diPlasma

Fig. 1. The role of carnitine in the transport of mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid oxidation. Carnitine is actively transported via OCTN2 into the cytoplasm and forms ester bonds with long chain carboxylic acids by the action of carnitine palmitoyl transferase I (CPT I), located in the inner aspect of the 
outer mitochondrial membrane. Acylcarnitine is then translocated across the inner mitochondrial membrane by the carnitine acylcarnitine translocase 
(CACT) and cleaved by CPT II in the inner aspect of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Carnitine is released in the mitochondrial matrix and then return to 
the cytoplasm for another cycle, while the fatty acids are conjugated back to coenzyme A in the mitochondrial matrix and then enter the pathway of 
β-oxidation and ketone synthesis. FATP: fatty acid transport protein.

etary insufficiency (chronic TPN, malabsorption, soybean based infant formula), and drug therapy such as valproate acid and pivampicillin.18)
Cardiac Involvement of Carnitine Defficiency
In 1980, the first case of PCD was described by Chapoy et al.19) in a 
3-year-old boy. The initial presentations were hypoketotic hypoglycemic encephalopathy, hepatomegaly, and cardiomegaly when he 
was 3 months old. This boy responded dramatically to oral L-carnitine supplementation, as evidenced by increased muscle strength, 
relief of cardiomyopathy, and complete repletion in the liver. Since 
then, more and more evidence has demonstrated that PCD is a treatable cause of cardiomyopathy in children.
There is a considerably broad phenotypic range associated with 
PCD, ranging from early infantile decompensation to adults who 
are predominantly asymptomatic. Of the various phenotypes manifested by this condition, the most common presentation of the disease is progressive cardiomyopathy with or without skeletal muscle weakness beginning at 1-4 year of age. A comprehensive review 
of 61 literature-reported PCD cases revealed an exclusive cardiac 
manifestation frequency of 62.3% with a very low likelihood of simultaneous occurrence of cardiac and metabolic manifestations.20)
Cardiomyopathy is the most common clinical manifestation in 
children with PCD, which include dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. More specifically, Tripp et al.3) reported 
a severe form of familial dilated cardiomyopathy similar to endocardial fibroelastosis due to systemic camitine deficiency. Histologic 
evaluation at autopsy revealed massive lipid accumulation with 
endocardial fibrosis in both ventricles in their patient. The incidence 
of dilated cardiomyopathy was higher than hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in children with PCD.21) In our previous study, however, we 
observed a mild degree of ventricular hypertrophy in some patients 
presented with dilated cardiomyopathy.22) Stanley et al.23) reviewed 
the presenting features of 20 infants and children with defects in 
carnitine uptake. The most commonly noted clinical feature at initial 
presentation was progressive cardiomyopathy, which occurred in 
12 of the 20 patients in the cohort. The average age of cardiomyopathy presentation is 2-4 years of age, indicating that it takes a 
long period of time for the manifestations of severe carnitine deficiency in the heart and skeletal muscle to appear. Affected individuals are generally normal at birth and may be asymptomatic for 
several years until they develop overt signs of cardiomyopathy and 
congestive heart failure. Their cardiac function does not respond to 
inotropes or diuretics. If the condition is not correctly diagnosed and 
no carnitine is supplemented, progressive heart failure eventually 
leads to death.
Cardiomyopathy, which is frequent in infantile patients, is not 
commonly seen in adults. The prevalence of PCD in the Faroe Islands 
is the highest reported in the world (1 : 300).10)11) From a nationwide 
screening program in the Islands, 76 adult patients identified with 
PCD were predominantly asymptomatic with normal cardiac structure and function.24) However, the reported number of untreated 
adults with PCD is quite low elsewhere. Among previously reported 
cases, dilated cardiomyopathy was present only in one adult patient 
and excluded in most of the others.25)26) Moreover, SLC22A5 mutations are no more frequent in adult patients with cardiomyopathy 
than in the general population.27)
Cardiac arrhythmia, although rare, is another clinical manifestation in patients with PCD. In a literature review of 42 adult patients, 
cardiac arrhythmias were present in 5 of them (12%). Prolonged QT 
interval with syncope was described previously in two young women with PCD, but short QT intervals and ventricular fibrillation has 
also been reported in PCD patients.26)28) Ventricular fibrillation without overt cardiomyopathy may be a presenting symptom of PCD. A 
case report described a 15-year-old girl without overt cardiomyopathy presented with cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation, suggesting that carnitine uptake deficiency should be considered as a 
potential cause of unexplained cardiac arrhythmias.29) Bradycardia 
and atrial arrhythmias are also possible in PCD patients. The underlying mechanisms of arrhythmia in PCD have not yet been established.
A significant cohort of patients with PCD do not present symptoms in infancy or early childhood and remain asymptomatic into 
their adulthood. These observations are derived from the experience 
of expanded newborn screening programs that identified maternal 
PCD in mothers who were for the most part minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic.30) Unfortunately, the first clinical manifestation 
in asymptomatic individuals may be sudden death. Several sudden 
and unexpected deaths have been reported in PCD patients.31) Severe ventricular arrhythmias are suspected as the cause of unexpected death in patients harboring the defect.
Carnitine deficiency can be exacerbated by other causes, such as 
pivalic acid exposure. Treatment with antibiotics containing pivalic 
acid results in increased excretion of carnitine in urine and reduced 
carnitine concentration in serum. A previous report showed a strong 
association between pivalic acid exposure and severe complications including encephalopathy and lethal cardiac arrhythmia in patients with PCD.32)
Although there are few special echocardiographic features in patients of PCD with cardiomyopathy, it has been reported that some 
of them present with characteristic changes on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Tripp et al.3) first described these changes in 1981 in a 
school aged girl of PCD with cardiomyopathy and cardiac syncope.

He noted a bizarre T-wave enlargement (60 to 80 mm) similar to 
that seen in extensive posterior-wall ischemia as well as hyperkalemia in the mid-precordial leads. Since then, Waber et al.4) and 
Matsuishi et al.33) respectively reported similar electrocardiographic 
findings in children with PCD and cardiomyopathy. It is even more 
interesting that Waber et al. observed peaked T waves reverting to 
normal after L-carnitine treatment. Thus, he pointed out that tall, 
peaked T waves in the mid-precordial leads should raise the question of systemic carnitine deficiency. More recently, Tein et al.34) reported four children with PCD and cardiomyopathy, three of whom 
had strikingly peaked T waves on the ECG which also disappeared 
with L-carnitine therapy. In our previously reported six cases of PCD 
and cardiomyopathy, similar T wave alterations were found in five 
of them and disappeared after L-carnitine therapy. Moreover, we 
found that all our six patients presented with short QT interval owned 
to the significantly shortened or even disappeared ST-segment, and 
the intervals normalized after L-carnitine therapy (Fig. 2).22) Retrospective data analysis of the publications mentioned above also 
demonstrated tall peaked T waves and short QT intervals simultaneously. Labarthe et al.28) pointed out that these ECG changes are associated to ventricular tachycardia and sudden death of PCD patients, but the underling mechanisms are still unknown. A recent 
study showed that long-chain acylcarnitines could lead to action 
potential repolarization abnormalities by regulating the rapidly activated delayed rectifier potassium channel (Ikr/HERG) in vitro.
35) This 
might be a possible explanation why PCD patients present with 
highly elevated T waves and shortened QT intervals similar to those 
seen in patients with hyperkalemia. It is still not clear whether the 
presence of short QT intervals is specific in patients with PCD compared to the other cardiomyopathies. Further studies need to prove 
the correlation between short QT intervals and sudden cardiac death 
in this population. 
Cardiac Manifestation in Heterozygotes
Heterozygous carriers usually have about 50% carnitine transport activity in fibroblasts and can have borderline low plasma carnitine levels due to increased urinary loss.16) This raises a question of 
whether they may be susceptible to cardiac dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy and arrhythmias in the context of aging and additive cardiac risk factors. Although, in general, patients who are heterozygous for SLC22A5 mutations have been thought to be asymptomatic, Garavaglia et al.36) described a 4-month-old male heterozygous infant with poor growth, vomiting, and left ventricular hypertrophy as shown by ECG and ECHO at 8 months of age. Studies of 
animal models have shown that such heterozygotes have a higher 
incidence of cardiomyopathy with aging and may be at risk for cardiac abnormalities when additional cardiac burdens are imposed.37)38)

A genetic epidemiological study in Japan showed that the prevalence of heterozygotes for SLC22A5 mutations was 1.01%, and the 
echocardiography analysis revealed that they were predisposed to 
late onset benign cardiac hypertrophy (odds ratio 15.1, 95% CI 1.39-
164) compared with wild-types.9) However, a recent study examined 
the prevalence of heterozygotes for SLC22A5 mutations in 324 patients with cardiomyopathy and demonstrated that heterozygosity 
for PCD is not more frequent in patients with unselected types of 
cardiomyopathy and is unlikely to be an important cause of cardiomyopathy.27) Finally, heterozygosity for PCD mutations has been associated with cardiac arrhythmias that resolve after carnitine treatment.39) In any case, considering that about 1% of the population is 
heterozygous for this potentially treatable condition, more studies 
with careful follow-ups are deserved in the future.
Genotype-Phenotype Relationship
No association between genotype and phenotype in PCD was 
found in previous studies.40) Patients with identical mutations can 
have different ages of onset and different types of clinical presentations.41) Even siblings with the same mutation have different ages of 
onset and different progressions of disease pointing to the presence 
of clinical heterogeneity.21) However, a recent study suggested that 
nonsense and frameshift mutations are typically associated with 
lower carnitine transport and are more prevalent in symptomatic individuals whereas missense mutations and inframe deletions, which 
are more prevalent in asymptomatic individuals, may result in proteins with retained residual carnitine transport activity.42) Another 
study suggests that the R245X and V295X mutations of SLC22A5
may be associated with cardiomyopathy as the only clinical phenotype.43)
Diagnosis
The clinical criteria for PCD include severe reduction of plasma or 
tissue carnitine levels (free carnitine <5 mM, controls 25-50 mM); 
evidence that low carnitine levels impair fatty acid oxidation; correction of the disorder when carnitine levels are restored; and the absence of other primary defects in fatty acid oxidation. Diagnosis can 
be further confirmed by demonstrating reduced carnitine transport 
in skin fibroblasts in the patient or by mutation analyses of the SLC22A5 gene. The introduction of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/
MS) for the analysis of plasma acylcarnitine profile has greatly facilitated the identification of patients with defects in fatty acid 
β-oxidation and has unquestionably been the most striking advance in newborn screening. With the advent of expanded newborn 
screening, more patients with milder or asymptomatic presentations 
are getting diagnosed with PCD. Therefore, the actual prevalence of 
this condition in the general population may be much higher than 
originally anticipated.44)
Primary carnitine deficiency should be differentiated from other 
causes of carnitine deficiency. Severe secondary carnitine depletion 
is also a characteristic feature of many inborn errors of metabolism, 
some of which may present as cardiomyopathy. These include a 
number of organic acidemias, defects of fatty acid oxidation and of 
the carnitine cycle. In all these disorders, analysis of urine organic 
acids, plasma amino acids and acylcarnitine profile, in conjunction 
with the clinical presentation, allows a definitive diagnosis.45)
The identification of abnormal cardiac muscle function should 
help clinicians to consider all possible causes, including genetic and 
acquired disorders of energy metabolism. It has been proposed that 
all children with idiopathic cardiomyopathy should be evaluated for 
carnitine deficiency, as treatment with high-dose carnitine supplementation can reverse the pathology. In our previous study, carnitine deficiency was detected using tandem mass spectrometry in 
six of seventy-five children with dilated cardiomyopathy; PCD was 
further confirmed by mutation analyses of the SLC22A5 gene.22)
Some adults dying from ventricular fibrillation may have suffered 
from undiagnosed PCD. Although rare, PCD should be routinely investigated as a cause of cardiac arrhythmias since arrhythmia episodes can be prevented by oral carnitine supplementation. PCD 
should be suspected in patients with cardiomyopathy and electrocardiographic tall peaked T waves in the mid-precordial leads, with or 
without short QT intervals.
Therapy and Prognosis
Treatment of this disorder with L-carnitine is highly effective in 
correcting cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness as well as any 
impairment in fasting ketogenesis. The Food and Drug Administration first approved L-carnitine in 1985 for the treatment of PCD. 
Primary treatment involves supplementation of oral L-carnitine. 
Typically a high dose, 100-400 mg/kg/day, that is divided in three 
doses is required. The dose of carnitine should be adapted to each 
individual patient by serial measurements of plasma carnitine levels. Treatment should include, in addition to L-carnitine, supportive 
and other therapies as indicated by the condition of the patient. No 
side-effects are noted for L-carnitine supplementation except occasional diarrhea or fishy body odour. This is usually self-limiting 
and resolved by reducing carnitine dosage.45)
Treatment with oral L-carnitine at pharmacologic levels is quite 
effective in treating cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness in these 
children. Within a few weeks of therapy, there was a dramatic resolution of severe congestive heart failure and myopathy in all pa-

790 Primary Carnitine Deficiency and Cardiomyopathy

tients; within a few months of therapy, there was a reduction of 
heart size toward normal. On the other hand, suspension of treatment leads to the recurrence of signs and symptoms. In our previous study, PCD was identified in 6 patients presented with progressive cardiomyopathy, characterized by enlargement of the left 
ventricle and greatly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). 
After 6-month treatment of L-carnitine, LVEF returned to normal in 
all 6 patients. Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter decreased in 
all of the 6 patients and returned to normal levels in 3 patients (Fig. 
3). No clinical signs or symptoms were present in all 6 patients. The 
only complications of L-carnitine therapy was intermittent diarrhea 
in 1 patient.22)
The low number of reported adult PCD patients in the literature 
has made it difficult to assess the risks and susceptibility to complications in patients suffering from PCD. It is not clear whether the 
apparently asymptomatic cases of the defect require the same degree of therapy as this is a recent observation and inavailability of 
sufficient follow-up data. 
Currently, there is no consensus on the treatment of SLC22A5
heterozygotes with L-carnitine supplementation. Careful prospective 
follow-up of SLC22A5 heterozygotes for carnitine deficiency with 
more sensitive modalities of cardiac testing is needed to assess 
whether long-term carnitine deficiency increases the risk of cardiac dysfunction.39)
Carnitine levels may be nonspecifically depressed in patients 
with cardiomyopathy, regardless of the underlying cause. This constitutes the basis for administration of L-carnitine to all children 
with dilated cardiomyopathy. Such a strategy has been shown to 
be useful in a multicenter retrospective study involving North American Centers and in a small prospective uncontrolled study from India.46)47) Moreover, several studies have examined the efficacy and 
safety of L-carnitine treatment for cardiomyopathy in adult patients 
without PCD, which suggested that L-carnitine therapy may improve the functional status of patients with moderate to severe heart 
failure attributable to dilated cardiomyopathy.48) However, the role 
of carnitine depletion in cardiomyopathy and heart failure in patients without PCD, as well as the potential of L-carnitine supplementation as an element in the treatment of these disorders, is still 
under investigation and debate.
The prognosis for individuals with PCD depends on the age, presentation, and severity of symptoms at the time of diagnosis.44) Early 
detection of these disorders before the occurrence of irreversible 
organ damage may lead to more effective treatment and more favorable outcomes.
Until now, very few cases of cardiomyopathy due to PCD with longterm follow-up have been reported in the literature. Several children have survived into their third decade and appear to be doing 
well, even though L-carnitine treatment raises muscle carnitine 
concentrations to only 5-10% of normal.49)50) Two patients have 
died suddenly of cardiac arrest in their second and third decades 
when L-carnitine supplementation was discontinued, suggesting 
that continued treatment is essential.50)51)
Up to now, there have been no formal surveillance guidelines for 
patients with PCD. Lifelong treatment with L-carnitine and avoidance of fasting or prolonged exercise are required. Regular echocardiogram, ECG and plasma carnitine level evaluation is mandatory 
during follow-up visits.
