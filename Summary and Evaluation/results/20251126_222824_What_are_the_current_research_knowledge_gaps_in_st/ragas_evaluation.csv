What are the current research/knowledge gaps in standardizing perfusion protocols?,"['feasibility of a porcine model by perfusing swine limbs\nfor up to 12 h with autologous blood [18]. The same\ngroup later allotransplanted a small series after 12 h of\nex vivo perfusion and showed promising results regard\ufffeing reperfusion injury and muscle contractility. More\ufffeover, it could be shown that muscle contractility\nreturned to nearly normal [19]. A Boston group analyzed\nseven forelimbs of pigs and divided these into two co\ufffehorts of cold perfusion compared to cold storage for 12\nh [20]. In 2016, Ozer and colleagues subsequently in\ufffecreased the perfusion period to 24 h in a porcine model\nof eight limbs and applied normothermic perfusion with\nautologous blood [21]. However, a recent review of the\ncurrent literature on this topic concluded that there is\nno standard protocol for EVLP, and it cannot be clearly\nstated whether the used perfusion solutions are optimal\nfor experimental or clinical vascularized composite tis\ufffesue allotransplantation (VCA) [22]. Additionally, in\n2017, Werner and colleagues from the University of\nMichigan reported the ex situ perfusion of five human\nlimb allografts from deceased heart-beating donors,\nwhich was feasible for up to 24 h with only small signs\nof tissue deterioration [23]. In summary, the limitations of\nthe current literature are that there is no standardized per\ufffefusion protocol, and there are no data available indicating\nthe effects of different perfusion solutions and tempera\ufffetures, the various involved cell types (e.g., endothelial cells,\nnerve cells), or graft viability and functionality. Further\ufffemore, a common problem in the aforementioned studies\nwas weight gain during perfusion due to edema, but there\nare currently no data available about the impact of weight\ngain on subsequent replantation or transplantation,\nespecially in humans. A selection of studies on ex vivo tis\ufffesue perfusion is summarized in Table 1. Of note, all stud\ufffeies had perfusion times of no more than 24 h. In the\nmilitary setting, the necessity for longer perfusion periods\nis highly likely due to strategic evacuations to Role 4 facil\ufffeities. In our experience from the Afghanistan missions, the\naverage time between damage control surgery in the Role\n3 facility and strategic evacuation to the Role 4 facility in\nGermany was 48–72 h.\nPresentation of the hypothesis\nThe current lack of replantation possibilities in military\noperations with high rates of amputation could be ad\ufffedressed with the development of a portable, clinically ap\ufffeplicable EVLP device. There are several opportunities\npresent with the introduction of EVLP on the horizon.\nCritical ischemic time\nFirst, EVLP is able to notably prolong the ischemic\nperiods. After recovering the amputated limb, it can\nbe conserved in the perfusion device under physio\ufffelogical conditions until the damage control surgery\nhas been performed and the patient stabilized. Cur\uffferently, the “life before limb” approach is unquestion\ufffeably feasible and even recommended. Therefore,\nEVLP is associated with higher tactical and strategic\nflexibility. Strategic aeromedical evacuation can be\nplanned and executed cautiously without the pressure\nof time, and definitive care in a Role 4 facility can be\ncarefully planned.\nTable 1 Selection of previous studies on ex vivo perfusion in solid organs and extremities\nWorking group Year of publication Characteristics\nWarnecke et al.

Whereas, static cold storage (SCS) has been successfully applied over decades with\ngood outcomes in standard criteria donor (SCD) organs, at present, marginal or expanded criteria donor (ECD) organs in particular are increasingly preserved by\nhypothermic (HMP) or normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) technologies. After initial cold perfusion [*and optimally following normothermic regional perfusion\n(NRP) in Donation after cardiac death (DCD) organs], machine perfusion is commenced either at the retrieval center or at the transplant center in a “back to hub”\napproach. The next step is to effectively use the prolonged preservation times of ECD grafts achieved by optimized machine perfusion protocols to characterize ECD\norgan quality and transplantability via the assessment of biomarkers. To improve graft quality, NMP provides an ideal platform for future immunomodulatory\nmodifications and organ repair.\nso far), hypothermic preservation with/without oxygen, and\nnormothermic perfusion. Normothermic regional perfusion\n(NRP) is mentioned in Figure 1, as it has become an important\ntool for use before the procurement process of DCD starts. The\nfollowing sections will not present NRP data in particular, as the\nreview is about machine preservation in marginal donor organs.\nHowever, good and satisfying results after kidney, pancreas,\nheart, and liver transplantation were reported by several groups\nin the United Kingdom, Spain, and France and have been\nsummarized by previous reviews (37–42).\nRecently, Ruiz et al. presented a series of 46 livers transplanted\nafter NRP and concluded that their results, including 23%\nearly allograft dysfunction, are superior to standard DCD organ\nprocurements and comparable to donation after brain death\n(DBD) results (43). The Cambridge group (United Kingdom),\nclear NRP proponents, commented on this publication in a way\nsimilar to our suggestions illustrated in Figure 1. The publication\nby Ruiz et al. (43), like many others before it, did not compare the\nresults to an adequate prospectively organized control group.\nIt is noteworthy that, only recently, a protocol for NRP\nwas established even for DCD heart transplantation. Due to a\nrestoration of function of the arrested heart, organ assessment via\nechocardiography, pressure-volume loops, and cardiac-output\nmeasurements could be implemented (44).\nAccepted criteria for subsequent heart transplantation after\nweaning from mechanical support are defined as: cardiac\nindex >2.5 L/min/m2\n; central venous pressure < 12 mm Hg;\npulmonary capillary wedge pressure < 12 mm Hg; left ventricular\nejection fraction > 50% in transoesophageal echocardiography.\nNRP leads to a meaningful increment of survival benefits and\nhelps to enlarge the available donor pool by utilizing marginal\ndonor organs in a safe way (45, 46). Future trials are needed to\ncompare DCD organ transplantation +/– NRP followed by +/–\na combination of preservation techniques (42, 45).\nSince 2009, dynamic cold storage—hypothermic machine\nperfusion (HMP)—has progressed to become clinical routine in\nseveral fields of SOT—above all, in kidney preservation. Moers\net al. published their landmark paper in the New England Journal\nof Medicine and demonstrated a significantly lowered DGF\nrate in recipients receiving a hypothermically perfused kidney\ncompared to a renal graft stored on ice in the common way\n(47). Applying the same technology (HMP without supplemental\noxygenation), numerous publications on DCD and ECD kidneys\nhave followed over the past 10 years, showing similar results:\nECD and DCD kidneys and their recipients clearly benefit from\nMP as long as the duration of cold ischemia time (CIT) is\nreasonable (48–52). During the second half of the recent decade,\noxygen as a supplement has been focused on for kidney HMP.\nIn 2016, Jochmans et al. published an overview of ongoing', '(Continued from previous page)\nConclusions: The type and volume of fluid used for perioperative management need to be individualized\naccording to the patient’s hemodynamic status and clinical condition. The amount of fluid given should be guided\nby well-defined physiologic targets. Compliance with a predefined hemodynamic protocol may be optimized by\nusing a computerized system. The type of fluid should also be individualized, as should any drug therapy, with\ncareful consideration of timing and dose. It is our perspective that HES solutions remain a valid option for fluid\ntherapy in the perioperative context because of their effects on blood volume and their reasonable benefit/risk\nprofile.\nKeywords: Colloid, Balanced crystalloids, Fluid responsiveness, Hemodynamic monitoring, Acute renal failure, Outcome\nBackground\nPerioperative fluid therapy is a routine aspect of daily\nclinical practice for most anesthesiologists but remains a\ntherapeutic challenge. One of the most complex aspects\nof perioperative fluid therapy is determining how much\nfluid to give each patient. Numerous observational studies\nhave reported a strong association between both excessive\nand insufficient perioperative fluid administration and an\nincreased risk of postoperative complications [1–6]. As it is\ndifficult to predict or anticipate the volume of fluids a pa\ufffetient will need during surgery, several national and inter\ufffenational societies recommend using goal-directed fluid\ntherapy (GDFT) based on advanced hemodynamic moni\ufffetoring in patients undergoing high-risk surgery [7–10].\nGDFT has been promoted as helping to standardize fluid\nadministration using recommended and validated proto\ufffecols, thereby improving patient outcomes and decreasing\ncosts [11–13]. Despite an abundance of literature on this\ntopic, the volume of fluid that should be administered to\nachieve and maintain normovolemia is still the subject\nintense controversy.\nThe choice of intravenous fluid type has also been a\nsubject of passionate debate, recently refueled by the\npublication of several large, prospective, randomized\nstudies in different patient populations. These studies\nhave demonstrated the impact of intravenous fluid solu\ufffetions on patient outcomes, particularly in critically ill pa\ufffetients in the intensive care setting [14]. Although their\nresults have created intense controversy, these studies\nhave clearly demonstrated that the need for intravenous\ninfusions may vary considerably in a given patient during\nthe course of his/her clinical course [15]. They have also\nindicated that results observed in critically ill patients can\ufffenot be extrapolated to surgical patients. The R.O.S.E. con\ufffeceptual model (Resuscitation, Optimization, Stabilization,\nEvacuation) condenses precisely a dynamic approach of\nfluid therapy allowing to maximize its benefits while redu\ufffecing its harms [16]. Importantly, surgical patients receiv\ufffeing i.v fluids in the perioperative setting are typically in\nthe “Optimization phase” and this specific category of pa\ufffetients will be discussed in the present review. Therefore,\nthe goal of this narrative review article is to discuss the\nfundamentals of perioperative fluid therapy through four\nfrequently asked questions regarding perioperative fluid\ntherapy.\nMain text\nQuestion 1: should we administer fluids in a goal-directed\nfashion?\nYES.\nThere is quite strong evidence to support the benefits\nof GDFT in high-risk patients undergoing major surgical\nprocedures [9, 11]. Indeed, over the past 15 years, several\nmeta-analyses of the impact of GDFT in patients under\ufffegoing moderate and high-risk surgeries have observed\nthat GDFT improves outcome compared with routine\ncare [8, 11, 17–20]. However, the studies included in\nthese meta-analyses are highly heterogeneous, with dif\ufffeferent protocols, different physiologic endpoints, and\ndifferent technologies to measure stroke volume and\ncardiac output. Interestingly, these studies demonstrate', 'Hypothermic ex-vivo perfusion of the kidney produced\nimpressive results and resulted in increases in the number\nof organs available for transplantation. Similar advances\nhave not translated to liver transplantation, however, where\nSCS remains the prominent preservation modality outside of\nclinical trials. Unlike kidneys, livers have a much higher met\ufffeabolic activity and tolerate prolonged ischemia poorly. With\ntheir high metabolic demand, donor livers have been more\nchallenging to perfuse and sustain under normothermic con\ufffeditions. Research into normothermic ex-vivo perfusion has\ncontinued over the last five decades. With advancements in\nthe perfusion technology and the understanding of organ\nphysiology, it has seen renewed interest as a platform to pre\ufffeserve, assess and potentially repair marginal donor organs.10\nThere are a number of devices currently in clinical use for\nthis procedure, including the Organ Assist’s Liver Assist (with\nan adjustable temperature range from 108\n–388 C; for per\ufffeformance of hypothermic and normothermic perfusion),11 the\nOrganOx Metra (normothermic perfusion)12 and the Trans\ufffemedics OCSTM Liver Portable Perfusion System (normother\ufffemic perfusion).13 Overall, these systems consist of a hepatic\nartery +/− portal vein pump, a perfusate reservoir and an\noxygenating chamber of oxygenated perfusion (Fig. 1).\nAlthough there is ongoing debate over the best preserva\ufffetion/perfusion temperature, normothermic (liver) machine\nperfusion (NMP or normothermic machine liver perfusion)\nappears to be gaining more traction and acceptance, compared\nto subnormothermic perfusion and hypothermic machine\nperfusion (HMP). It is, thus, likely to become the standard of\nex-vivo machine perfusion.

While the current practice might be\nreasonable in the sense that it is building on the combination of\nparameters currently best established, alternatives are needed but\nneed to be more formally established prior to considering them\nnew clinical standards.\nA Brief History\nThe original vision of organ preservation as formulated in 1813\nwas built on the continuation of circulation and blood supply\n(72). The substitution of blood with perfusion solutions led to\nprolonged successful preservation of tissues, as described by\nCarrell (73). While prolonged successful preservation of tissues\nseems plausible according to these early findings, the actual\nsuitability for transplantation remained to be established (72).\nSuccessful kidney preservation for 3 to 5 days was achieved by\nthe use of continuous perfusion with cooled, oxygenated blood\nor plasma (74). Since continuous warm perfusion, oxygenation,\nand nutrition of an organ during transportation was technically\nvery demanding, the alternative concept eventually surpassed MP\nin the 1960s. The chemical composition of advanced solutions\nfor hypothermic organ storage resulted in excellent short-term\npreservation with good outcomes after transplantation. As with\nany achievement, the good results are a blessing and a curse.\nWith patient and graft survival as the only hard endpoints for\nclinical trials, the room for improvement became very small—\nat least with standard criteria organs. The search for superior\ntechnologies found a platform for clinical realization only when\nthe results after transplantation became less convincing, with a\ngreater effect on bile ducts as a target for early damage in liver\ntransplantation (72, 75–77). The organ shortage, together with\nthe push to use lower-quality organs and organs with additional\ndamage as a result of DCD, triggered the clinical realization of\nMP in liver transplantation.\nCurrent Situation\nThe current status of organ preservation remains largely defined\nby SCS. The well-established and standardized procedures of\norgan storage in three sterile plastic bags filled with preservation\nsolution (bag 1) or saline/ringer lactate/other (bags 2/3) is well\ufffeestablished, with a relatively good understanding of the risk\naccumulating with the duration of preservation. The major\nadvantage of SCS is the safety of the procedure. Pretty much\nnothing can happen to an organ in plastic bags, on ice, in\na plastic container. The major limitations of this technique\nrelate to the fact that metabolism continues—even though\nat a very low rate—eventually resulting in the accumulation\nof succinate and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (78–81). The\nimmediate exposure to normothermia and oxygen results in an\ninflammatory response and organ-specific damage early after\ntransplantation. The mechanisms responsible for the eventual\norgan damage not only in organ transplantation but also in\nother diseases such as cardiac infarction and stroke are well\ufffeestablished but not are the focus of this review. The key question\nin the consideration of NMP as an alternative to SCS is how\neffectively the mechanisms leading to an IRI are interrupted\nthrough either immediate NMP or NMP following SCS. While\npreclinical evidence (81) and the phase II/III trial by Nasralla et al.\n(62) have delivered evidence suggesting that NMP is superior to\nSCS when applied immediately, the actual net benefit of NMP\nfollowing SCS remains to be more clearly established. While\na key elements in such assessments are the proper definition\nof and agreement in the community on suitable endpoints\nregarding the preservation quality, the accompanying benefits\nand alternative endpoints should not be overlooked. The major\nbenefit of NMP vs. SCS is the time gained with (as it appears)\na relatively safe prolongation of preservation times under close\nto physiological conditions. The ability to monitor the viability', 'Scientific Reports | (2020) 10:6063 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-62979-9 5\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/ www.nature.com/scientificreports\nDiscussion\nThe present prospective pilot non-randomized clinical study suggests how hypothermic oxygenated machine \nperfusion results effective and safe in both liver and kidney transplantation. While administration of oxygen \nthrough machine perfusion for liver preservation was largely investigated in a previous clinical study20, few \nreports described HOPE in KT21. Since 1964, several in vivo and preclinical studies report the oxygen use in \nhyperbaric and normobaric conditions to perfuse renal grafts22,23. Here, we report the first clinical trial of HOPE \nin kidney transplant, reporting safety and efficacy in reducing ischemic preservation injuries.\nThe use of the same perfusion device for liver and kidney grafts results as one of the most innovative find\ufffeing of the present study compared to other previous studies11,13,14,24: organ perfusion with this machine is easily \nperformed and it may be initiated at the time of surgical graft preparation during the “back-table” procedures, \navoiding unnecessary CIT extension.\nAn increasing number of researches suggest how the beginning of hypothermic oxygenated perfusion soon \nafter graft retrieval promotes the reduction of waste products, such as succinates, that usually accumulate in the \ngraft during static storage, and increasing the restoring of mitochondrial function25,26.\nOur protocol begins with a 30–40 minutes graft washing during organ preparation, with the aim to remove \nwaste products commonly released and accumulated during ischemia time. Furthermore, we equipped our organ \nperfusion system with an adsorbing hemofilter able to remove cytokines and to avoid fat embolism. After the \nwashing phase, oxygenation of the preservation solution begins, with recirculation of the same fluid. We believe \nthis strategy may replace the necessity to immediately start graft perfusion at the end of the retrieval, if CIT is \nmaintained low, as in our study. Metabolites quantification in the perfusates during the flushing phase, compared \nto the usual perfusion time, may demonstrate the benefit of the washing strategy prior to recirculation of HOPE. \nThe limit of our study is due to the lack of these data.\nThe missing of additional perfusates at regular times during perfusion, may represent a further limitation: a \nregular analysis of perfusates could be helpful to better understand organ metabolism during perfusion.\nIn the present study no adverse events were reported as a consequence of perfusion treatment and the out\ufffecome was excellent, with no occurrence of graft dysfunction in HOPE-L despite advanced donor age. No graft \nfailure was registered in HOPE-K, and only two cases had DGF. Moreover, recipients in HOPE-K with DGF \nhad undergone perfusion treatment for less than two hours, as compared to non-DGF patients which actually \nunderwent perfusion treatment for more than 2hours. Therefore, based on our experience, we suggest that kidney \nperfusion should last at least two hours; this treatment time could be possibly longer, as suggested by a pre-clinical \nstudy27.\nThis clinical series – to the best of our knowledge – is the first report of HOPE in ECD kidney transplantation; \ntherefore, there are no data about renal preservation issues to compare our results with. Similarly to HOPE-L \nwhich is performed for at least one-hour, HOPE for renal grafts should last at least two hours, but future rand\ufffeomized trials are needed to clarify this hypothesis11.\nMany studies, even from our center, showed that hypothermic oxygenation during organ perfusion is able to \nrestore ATP levels in liver and kidney grafts, improving the functional recovery after transplantation19,28,29. Our \nclinical results showed a better liver function with HOPE compared to SCS in the setting of marginal donation,', 'Scientific Reports | (2020) 10:6063 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-62979-9 7\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/ www.nature.com/scientificreports\nthe analyses of the long-term results of this clinical series could be of interest, as well as other similar research \nstudies with higher sample size.\nSimplicity, outcome benefits for liver and kidney transplantation and low-costs equipment are the winning \npoints of our HOPE system. The safety of our new machine perfusion system was confirmed by the absence of \nadverse events and by the observation that liver hypothermic oxygenation could be effective to improve graft \nfunction, similarly to other reported series in the setting of normothermic blood perfusion30,33.\nWe also measured different markers in perfusates at the beginning and the end of perfusion procedure. \nRegarding KT, NGAL resulted a positive predictive biomarker of renal outcomes at 1st, 3rd and 6th month of fol\ufffelow up: despite NGAL is largely known as a marker for acute and chronic renal injuries34–36, this result partially \ncorrelates with our previous findings, suggesting the role of NGAL as an immunomodulatory molecule, able to \npromote immune tolerance through regulatory T cells (Treg)37,38 therefore favoring better clinical outcomes.\nIn LT, significative differences of all perfusate markers were reported when measured at the end of perfusion if \ncompared with the beginning. Recently Dutkosky et al.\n39 demonstrated that mitochondrial flavin levels in perfu\ufffesates during hypothermic oxygenated perfusion might be a marker of better liver graft function. Our preliminary \nresults confirm the relevance of markers in the perfusate and the fact that perfusate analysis is a further tool to \npredict clinical grafts outcomes. We are currently exploring a new field where further studies involving a larger \nsample size and a more comprehensive panel of biomarkers are needed, with the aim to detect optimal targetable \nmarkers to correlate with graft function or to confirm the results of Zurich center.\nSummarizing, we consider our innovative system as a functional tool to allow marginal grafts transplanta\ufffebility, with the aim to reduce utilization avoidance of grafts which are actually discarded19,40,41. Moreover, the \nanalysis of the perfusate may help to evaluate organ viability even in hypothermic conditions, and the infusion of \ntherapeutic agents – e.g. nutrition, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and extracellular vesicles releasing by MSC, \nanti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic additives – might be a simple implement of the perfusion system in use42–45.\nFuture trials exploring this field must confirm not only safety and benefits, but also cost effectiveness, as some \nperfusion strategies are still associated with exorbitant costs.\nIn conclusion, HOPE for ECD-DBD grafts is safe and effective in reducing preservation injury and in improv\ufffeing graft function and outcomes for kidney and liver transplantation. Future randomized clinical studies with a \nrepresentative sample size are needed to confirm our results and hypothesis.\nMethods\nStudy design. This national, single-center, prospective interventional arm with a retrospective case-con\ufffetrolled arm, pilot non-randomized clinical study was performed at the General Surgery and Transplant Unit of \nUniversity of Bologna Sant’Orsola - Malpighi Hospital in accordance to the Helsinki Declaration. Ethical approval \nwas obtained by local committee of University of Bologna Sant’Orsola - Malpighi Hospital in June 2016. The \nenrolment process of the interventional study arm was planned considering one procedure per month (liver or \nkidney perfusion before transplantation) following the inclusion criteria in the period from October 2016 to \nDecember 2017.

Livers/kidneys were harvested in a standard fashion and according to our \npolicy for ECD5,50–52. At the end of the retrieval procedures, the organs were stored in cooling sterile bag with \nnew SCS solution and transported to the transplant hospital, where we started the perfusion protocol in the study \ngroup.\nLiver graft histopathological analysis. In order to verify the homogeneity between HOPE-L and SCS-L \ngroups, as well as between HOPE-K and SCS-K groups, the graft histopathology was revised by two different \npathologists in all cases.\nHypothermic oxygenated perfusion. After notification to the Health National System for the clinical use \nin organ perfusion, an innovative machine perfusion developed and described in a previous experimental study19\nwas used to perform ex-vivo hypothermic oxygenated perfusion.\nThis machine perfusion is composed by two pump units that produce a continuous and pulsatile flow to the \nvein or artery respectively, which is set at high values for liver perfusion (median value over 100mL/min) and at \nlower values for kidney perfusion (median value minor to 60mL/min).\nBefore HOPE set-up, the inner and outer sterile flow tubes were connected to the medical devices and the \npriming phase was started. Belzer University of Wisconsin machine perfusion solution was used for priming \nand organ perfusion steps. At the begin of surgical back-table, portal vein or renal artery were cannulated with \nspecial cannulas for organ perfusion of different sizes (8–12 F for kidney and 18–24F for liver). Each organ was \nconnected to the perfusion device through the attachment of the vascular cannula to the inner perfusion tubes, \nalready assembled to the machine. HOPE was performed at 4 °C, with a portal vein pressure of 5mmHg or renal \nartery pressure of 25mmHg and an oxygen partial pressure (paO2) of 600–750mmHg. Oxygen is provided to the \nfluid perfusion through the addition of a membrane oxygenator to the perfusion circuit. Flow, pressure and tem\ufffeperature values were monitored frequently by the organ perfusion team involved and registered on USB memory \nsupport. Perfusate gas analysis were accomplished every 15 minutes on effluent perfusate samples to measure \npaO2, pH, and lactate production.\nSterility of perfusion treatment under study was tested performing microbial cultures on perfusion fluid \nbefore (T0) and after HOPE (T1).\nHypothermic oxygenated perfusion was performed in two steps: the first one was the flushing of the organ \nwith hypothermic oxygenated solution for a duration of 30–40 minutes, and during the second step the organs \nwere moved in a different box to permit recirculation of the perfusate until implantation.\nGraft flushing started at the beginning of the back-table phase, thus without increasing the duration of the \nstandard surgical steps. Flushing was performed with hypothermic oxygenated solution and after 30–40minutes \nof graft flushing, the organs were moved in the another organ container to permit recirculation of the oxygenated \nperfusate. The algorithm treatment is reported in Fig.\xa03.\nTransplantation. According to the conventional procedures, surgical team performed kidney and liver \ntransplants. Renal transplants were accomplished into iliac fossa anastomosing the artery to the external/com\ufffemon/internal iliac arteries, the vein to the external/common iliac veins and the ureter to the bladder over a single \nstent. Orthotopic liver transplantation was performed with “piggyback” technique preserving the inferior vena \ncava; epato-choledocal anastomoses were performed over T-tube.', 'LOS and significantly less perioperative complications\ncompared with a standard management protocol with\npressure-based target parameters.\nThe first evidence that flow-based cardiovascular para\ufffemeters such as CO or oxygen delivery index (DO2I) cor\uffferelate with the outcome in high-risk patients or high\uffferisk surgery was shown by Shoemaker and colleagues\n[23,24]. Although these studies remained controversial,\nsubsequent work confirmed that goal-directed protocols\nfor perioperative management using flow-related para\ufffemeters improve patient outcome [1-3,5-8,25,26]. The\nunderlying mechanisms of the success of GDT are not\nyet entirely clear. Most authors assume that an oxygen\ndebt from decreased blood flow, hypoxia or hypovolemia\nmay cause mitochondrial damage and subsequent organ\ndysfunction [27]. Thus, adequate tissue oxygen supply\nseems to play a key role to prevent adverse patient out\ufffecome. Although blood flow to peripheral tissues is diffi\ufffecult to measure, tissue oxygen supply may be\napproximated using the DO2I. However, the DO2I needs\nto be calculated from information provided by repeated\nblood gas analyses. We therefore decided to use the CI\nas the target variable of the GDT protocol in this study,\nbecause this variable can be easily obtained and continu\ufffeously measured with the arterial waveform analysis\nmethod in a busy intraoperative setting. Together with\nadequate hemoglobin levels and arterial oxygen satura\ufffetion, we considered the CI as an adequate target for\nflow-based GDT.\nThe results of this study are in good agreement with\nprevious trials dealing with goal-directed hemodynamic\noptimization based on flow-related parameters, although\ntarget variables and methods to achieve the goals vary\nwidely in the literature. Lithium indicator dilution was\nused by Pearse and colleagues [1] to determine CO and\nDO2I in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.\nIn this study, patients in the intervention group were\noptimized postoperatively with colloids and dopexamine\nto achieve a DO2I of 600 ml min-1 m-2. A significant\nreduction in LOS from 29.5 days to 17.5 days and in the\nnumber of patients with complications (69% vs. 44%)\nwere found in comparison to a CVP-based protocol in a\nstandard care group.

Hence, in a system with longer-distance organ\nexchange, additional steps and a new routine would need to be\nestablished. The technology and the shifting of the work of the\nbacktable procedure to the retrieving team need to be considered.\nThe alternative approach where the organ is transferred to\nthe recipient center and is then machine perfused is currently\nbeing pursued, but data indicating the actual advantage of this\napproach are lacking (195). For now, NMP serves as a technology\nthat allows one important asset in surgery to be gained: time.\nThe value of time and flexibility is dependent on the regional\ncircumstances but may hold great potential for easing the surgery\nlogistics, working hours, and surgical training but also gives rise\nto higher risks of nighttime procedures. The actual value of time\nin this context, however, requires further attention and needs to\nbe better defined.\nThe consideration of longer-term organ preservation under\nnormothermic conditions further carries the challenge of\ndefining the responsibilities for managing and monitoring the\norgans. Eventually, the working place description of health\ncare workers involved in this will require adoption and formal\ntraining. Standard operating procedures (SOP) and safety\nparameters need to be established for a wider spread use of\nthe technology. It is likely that the advanced technological\nrequirements and the need for 24-h availability of knowhow and\npersonnel would favor the establishment of regional hubs for MP.\nDespite the hype in the field, the clinical adoption of MP is\nslow. In addition to the above-mentioned factors, the lack of\nreimbursement is a stringent limitation in many regions. For the\ntechnology to be reimbursed, the authorities will require hard\nfacts. Hence, the path to more widespread clinical use might\nbe long, and the focus should remain on the demonstration of\nsuperiority regarding the most relevant clinical endpoints.\nOne major important step toward collective advancement in\nthis field would be the definition of data points during and\nafter MP and the establishment of registries for coordinated\ndata collection. Such data points should include the definition\nand terminology of the various time points and actions such as\ncold flush and storage prior to MP, temperature and flow during\nMP, parameters indicating metabolic function and bile/urine\nproduction during MP, second flush, second cold ischemia time,\nand others. One of the hurdles in improving NMP is the\nlarge number of variables added to preservation. Identifying\nthe relevance of individual parameters will require attention\nto the details of the procedure and adequate data collection\nand handling. To the knowledge of the authors, no routine\ndata collection and no consensus toward data points have been\nestablished at present.\nThe decision-making process in MP is relatively arbitrary\nsince the data collected during MP are suggestive but not formally\nestablished as quality-defining parameters. Since the decision to\ntransplant an organ or not is extremely meaningful, great care\nneeds to be applied in the process, and detailed documentation\nof the reasoning for decision making should be carried out. A\ngreater effort toward orchestrated data collection could help to\nstreamline and eventually enhance the robustness of the decision\ufffemaking process.\nThe preference for MP to be used for the preservation\nof marginal organs results from the greater need for\norgan assessment and the greater potential benefit of better\npreservation. This might be particularly true and relevant for\norgans from uncontrolled DCDs, where the circumstances and\nthe accumulated damage to the organs might be less clear. The\nvalue of an additional assessment under these conditions is not\nonly meaningful with respect to the number of additional organs\nfor transplantation but also for preventing the transplantation']","The article discusses the role of fluid therapy in perioperative settings, focusing on high-risk surgical patients who may benefit from goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) based on advanced hemodynamic monitoring. The author highlights the importance of individualizing fluid administration based on well-defined physiological targets and considering the timing and dosage of drugs. The author also emphasizes the need for compliance with predefined hemodynamic protocols, which may be optimized using computerized systems. The author notes that the choice of intravenous fluid type should also be individualized, taking into account the patient's hemodynamic status and clinical condition. The author recommends that colloid solutions remain a valid option for fluid therapy in perioperative settings due to their effects on blood volume and reasonable benefit-risk profile. The author concludes that the need for intravenous infusions varies considerably in a given patient during the course of their clinical course, and results obtained in critically ill patients cannot be extrapolated to surgical patients.

In another section, the author discusses the role of goal-directed fluid therapy in perioperative settings, highlighting the benefits of GDFT in high-risk patients undergoing major surgical procedures. The author cites several meta-analyses that indicate that GDFT improves outcomes compared to routine care. However, the author notes that the studies included in these meta-analyses are highly heterogeneous, with differences in protocols, physiological endpoints, and technologies used to measure stroke volume and cardiac output.

Finally, the author discusses the role of machine perfusion in organ preservation, noting that hypothermic ex-vivo perfusion of kidneys has led to impressive results and improved outcomes compared to static cold storage. The author suggests that normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) is gaining more traction and acceptance compared to subnormothermic perfusion and hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP). The author notes that despite the hype surrounding MP, clinical adoption is slow, and the lack of reimbursement is a significant limitation in many regions. The author suggests that the path to more widespread clinical use may be long, and the focus should remain on demonstrating superiority regarding the most relevant clinical endpoints. The author also highlights the need for standard operating procedures (SOP) and safety parameters to be established for a wider spread use of MP, as well as the need for registries for coordinated data collection to define data points during and after MP. The author concludes that identifying the relevance of individual parameters will require attention to the details of the procedure and adequate data collection and handling.",1.0,0.8533633389477938,CHUNKS_ONLY
What are the current research/knowledge gaps in standardizing perfusion protocols?,"[""HYPO TH E SI S Open Access\nEx vivo limb perfusion for traumatic\namputation in military medicine\nAlexander Kaltenborn1,2*, Nicco Krezdorn2\n, Sebastian Hoffmann1\n, André Gutcke1\n, Kirsten Haastert-Talini3\n,\nPeter M. Vogt2\n, Axel Haverich4 and Bettina Wiegmann4\nAbstract\nBackground: Limb loss has a drastic impact on a patient’s life. Severe trauma to the extremities is common in\ncurrent military conflicts. Among other aspects, “life before limb” damage control surgery hinders immediate\nreplantation within the short post-traumatic timeframe, which is limited in part by the ischemic time for successful\nreplantation. Ex vivo limb perfusion is currently being researched in animal models and shows promising results for\nits application in human limb replantation and allotransplantation.\nPresentation of the hypothesis: The current lack of replantation possibilities in military operations with high rates of\namputation can be addressed with the development of a portable ex vivo limb perfusion device, as there are several\nopportunities present with the introduction of this technique on the horizon. We hypothesize that ex vivo limb perfusion\nwill enable overcoming the critical ischemic time, provide surgical opportunities such as preparation of the stump and\nlimb, allow for spare-part surgery, enable rigorous antibiotic treatment of the limb, reduce ischemia-reperfusion injuries,\nenable a tissue function assessment before replantation, and enable the development of large limb transplant programs.\nTesting the hypothesis: Data from in vivo studies in porcine models are limited by the relatively short perfusion time of\n24 h. In the military setting, notably longer perfusion times need to be realized. Therefore, future animal studies must\nfocus especially on long-term perfusion, since this represents the military setting, considering the time for stabilization of\nthe patient until evacuation to a tertiary treatment center.\nImplications of the hypothesis: The development and clinical introduction of ex vivo limb perfusion in the military\nsetting could lead to a drastic reduction in the number of limb amputations among service members. Ex vivo limb\nperfusion enables replantation surgery in Role 4 facilities and changes the clinical setting from a highly urgent, life\ufffethreatening situation to a highly methodical, well-prepared starting point for optimal treatment of the wounded service\nmember. With its introduction, the principle of “life before limb” will change to “life before limb before elective\nreplantation/allotransplantation after ex vivo limb perfusion”.\nBackground\nAs early as 2008, a study from the United States pre\ufffedicted that by 2050, the number of amputations will in\ufffecrease by 72% [1]. The impact on the patents’ life and\nthe socio-economic consequences of limb loss are re\ufffemarkable. Patients eventually lose their jobs, and finan\ufffecial problems and social descent have been shown to be\nassociated with limb loss, which often lead to psycho\ufffelogical disorders (e.g., depression) [2].\nThe results of replantation surgery vary depending on\nthe cause of the amputation, the patient’s condition and\nthe quality of the specialized service provided. Further\ufffemore, recent evidence underlines the role of allotransplan\ufffetation of limbs in opposition to prosthetic limb\n© The Author(s). 2020 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License,\nwhich permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give\nappropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if\nchanges were made.

Replantation surgery is a highly elaborate\nmicrosurgical procedure that requires optimal interdiscip\ufffelinary cooperation within an experienced team (for the\naftercare as well). Therefore, the first line of treatment is\nlimb salvage, though this is not feasible in every case. The\ntechnically demanding surgical realization of replantation\nis often not the only limiting factor, narrow time frames\ndue to ischemia also need to be kept in mind [5]. The inci\ufffedence of polytraumatized patients with life-threatening ex\ufffetremity injuries is increasing [5]. Especially in these cases,\nthe strategy of “life before limb” damage control surgery\nwithin the short post-traumatic timeframe hinders replan\ufffetation, which is partly defined by the limited ischemic time\nfor successful replantation [4, 5]. This approach is basically\nequivalent between civilian and military trauma care.\nThere have been two major studies investigating the\noutcomes of reconstruction and amputation. The first\nwas the Lower Extremity Assessment Project (LEAP) [6],\nwhich focused on civilian healthcare. The results suggest\nthat the functional outcomes of reconstruction and am\ufffeputation are at least similar among civilians being treated\nfor major lower-extremity trauma [3, 4, 7]. Regardless of\nthe type of treatment, LEAP outcomes were not optimal,\nwith one-half of injured civilians reporting high levels of\ndisability. Military-specific data were analyzed by the\nMajor Extremity Trauma Research Consortium in their\nMilitary Extremity Trauma Amputation/Limb Salvage\n(METALS) study [8]. The METALS study focuses on\nmajor limb trauma in recent U.S. armed conflicts. In\nsummary, most of the analyzed parameters mirror the\nLEAP results. Nevertheless, there are major differences\nbetween the clinical setting for civilian and military\ntrauma amputation. The necessities of tactical evacuation\nin combat lead to longer ischemic times. Furthermore,\nthe amputated limb is often highly contaminated with\ndebris and dirt. Blast injuries especially are concomitant\nwith a high degree of soft tissue trauma and a significant\nloss of tissue. Data from registries and recent studies in\ufffedicate that approximately half of combat wounds\ninflicted in modern warfare are extremity injuries [9–11].\nFor severe injuries, either amputation or limb salvage\nprocedures are the only options in the combat surgical\nsetting, since replantation surgery is far too sophisticated\nand time-consuming under these conditions [12].\nOur hypothetical treatment approach for this obvious\nmilitary medical challenge is outlined in this paper. Re\ufffecently, there has been growing evidence for the successful\napplication of ex vivo perfusion in solid organ transplant\ufffeation [13–17]. Figure 1 shows the basic scheme of a ma\ufffechine perfusion system. For example, ex vivo heart and\nlung perfusion can be applied for up to 8 and 12 h, re\ufffespectively, in the clinical setting, and result in significantly\nbetter outcomes after transplantation compared to the\ngold standard of static cold organ preservation [14, 15].\nFurthermore, the first large randomized clinical trial in\nliver transplantation was recently published and supports\nthe aforementioned benefits of ex vivo organ perfusion\n[16]. In addition to the reduction of the cold ischemic\ntime, ex vivo organ perfusion systems can be used for ex\ufffetended criteria donor organs due to an improvement of\ngraft function during machine perfusion. Individualized\norgan therapy is possible following the reevaluation of the\norgan [17]. It can be assumed that ex vivo organ perfu\ufffesion is able to relieve the donor organ shortage.\nEx vivo limb perfusion (EVLP) has also gained interest\nin recent years, although the evidence on EVLP is still\nscarce. In 2011, Constantinescu et al. showed the\nFig. 1 Basic schematic of a machine perfusion system*. *Figure by Krezdorn N, Tasigiorgos S, Wo L, Turk M, Lopdruo R, Kiwanuka H, et al.

The same\ngroup later allotransplanted a small series after 12 h of\nex vivo perfusion and showed promising results regard\ufffeing reperfusion injury and muscle contractility. More\ufffeover, it could be shown that muscle contractility\nreturned to nearly normal [19]. A Boston group analyzed\nseven forelimbs of pigs and divided these into two co\ufffehorts of cold perfusion compared to cold storage for 12\nh [20]. In 2016, Ozer and colleagues subsequently in\ufffecreased the perfusion period to 24 h in a porcine model\nof eight limbs and applied normothermic perfusion with\nautologous blood [21]. However, a recent review of the\ncurrent literature on this topic concluded that there is\nno standard protocol for EVLP, and it cannot be clearly\nstated whether the used perfusion solutions are optimal\nfor experimental or clinical vascularized composite tis\ufffesue allotransplantation (VCA) [22]. Additionally, in\n2017, Werner and colleagues from the University of\nMichigan reported the ex situ perfusion of five human\nlimb allografts from deceased heart-beating donors,\nwhich was feasible for up to 24 h with only small signs\nof tissue deterioration [23]. In summary, the limitations of\nthe current literature are that there is no standardized per\ufffefusion protocol, and there are no data available indicating\nthe effects of different perfusion solutions and tempera\ufffetures, the various involved cell types (e.g., endothelial cells,\nnerve cells), or graft viability and functionality. Further\ufffemore, a common problem in the aforementioned studies\nwas weight gain during perfusion due to edema, but there\nare currently no data available about the impact of weight\ngain on subsequent replantation or transplantation,\nespecially in humans. A selection of studies on ex vivo tis\ufffesue perfusion is summarized in Table 1. Of note, all stud\ufffeies had perfusion times of no more than 24 h. In the\nmilitary setting, the necessity for longer perfusion periods\nis highly likely due to strategic evacuations to Role 4 facil\ufffeities. In our experience from the Afghanistan missions, the\naverage time between damage control surgery in the Role\n3 facility and strategic evacuation to the Role 4 facility in\nGermany was 48–72 h.\nPresentation of the hypothesis\nThe current lack of replantation possibilities in military\noperations with high rates of amputation could be ad\ufffedressed with the development of a portable, clinically ap\ufffeplicable EVLP device. There are several opportunities\npresent with the introduction of EVLP on the horizon.\nCritical ischemic time\nFirst, EVLP is able to notably prolong the ischemic\nperiods. After recovering the amputated limb, it can\nbe conserved in the perfusion device under physio\ufffelogical conditions until the damage control surgery\nhas been performed and the patient stabilized. Cur\uffferently, the “life before limb” approach is unquestion\ufffeably feasible and even recommended. Therefore,\nEVLP is associated with higher tactical and strategic\nflexibility. Strategic aeromedical evacuation can be\nplanned and executed cautiously without the pressure\nof time, and definitive care in a Role 4 facility can be\ncarefully planned.\nTable 1 Selection of previous studies on ex vivo perfusion in solid organs and extremities\nWorking group Year of publication Characteristics\nWarnecke et al.

Military Medical Research (2020) 7:21 Page 3 of 8\n\nSurgical opportunities\nBefore replantation, there is enough time for rigorous\ndebridement of both the stump and the amputated limb\nto facilitate the successful re-adaptation of all the im\ufffeportant anatomical structures. Further EVLP would\nallow for spare-part surgery of the perfused limb, even\nin cases of severe limb damage. As an example, in select\ncases, functional ankle joints could be used for knee\njoint replacement (van Nees procedure), or atypical\nosteomyocutaneous free flaps could be harvested from\nmangled perfused extremities.\nMicrobiological considerations\nCombat-related injuries have been shown to be at great\nrisk for contamination, especially with multi-resistant\npathogens [25]. The reasons for the high incidence of in\ufffefections with multi-resistant bacteria in combat wounds\nhave yet to be satisfyingly identified [25]. Moreover, soil\norganisms and the amount of exposure to dirt during in\ufffejury and tactical evacuation characterize the combat\uffferelated wound. EVLP enables the administration of high\ndoses of antibiotic and antifungal medications without\nthe constraints of systemic application [17]. Thus, these\ndoses can be much higher than the regularly adminis\ufffetered doses and can significantly decrease the risk of\npost-operative infections.\nIschemia and reperfusion-related injuries\nIschemia and reperfusion-related injuries (IRI) threaten\nnot only the replanted limb, but due to a sterile systemic\ninflammation, also the patient’s life [26]. Ischemia leads\nto metabolic changes in the affected tissue, depending\non the ischemic period, basically due to the shift from\naerobic to anaerobic energy production. With reperfu\ufffesion of the ischemic tissue, an immunological reaction\nconcomitant with cell apoptosis and necrosis is ob\ufffeserved. It has already been shown that the expression of\nhypoxia-related genes is less activated during ex vivo\nperfusion compared to static cold storage [24]. Thus, the\nreduction of IRI is a logical consequence of EVLP. Fur\ufffethermore, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory\nmeasures can be applied during ex vivo perfusion. A\ngood example for this pharmacological approach is the\naddition of prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) inhibitors,\nwhich have recently been shown to attenuate IRI in ex\ufffeperimental models [27].\nAssessment of tissue function.\nAnother great opportunity is the possibility to assess tis\ufffesue function and vitality during EVLP. From experiences\nwith normothermic machine perfusion for subsequent\ntransplantation of the liver, it is already known that re\ufffepeated evaluation of graft function and metabolism leads\nto higher rate of successful transplantation procedures\n[17]. It is possible that the tissue of amputated limbs\ncould be reconditioned during EVLP, for example by the\napplication of optimal oxygen levels and supplementa\ufffetion of nutrition.\nTransplantation and Immunoconditioning\nVCA is a further treatment option for cases in which re\ufffeplantation is not feasible (e.g., due to severe loss of tissue\nor a mangled extremity). However, the widespread appli\ufffecation of VCA has not yet been realized. It requires life\ufffelong immunosuppression, which is associated with re\ufffepercussions such as an increased risk of malignancy oc\ufffecurrence or renal failure [28, 29]. Recent data show\npromising results regarding the knockdown of major\nhistocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules [30, 31].\nThis approach might be able to reduce the amount of\npost-transplant immunosuppression, as well as the early\nallograft rejection risk. Furthermore, a study that applied\nex vivo perfusion in a VCA rat model showed a signifi\ufffecant reduction of MHC I expression by at least 50% in\nall tissue compartments [30]. It was also found that\nknockdown prolonged rejection-free survival by 60%\n[30]. Comparable results have recently been reported in\nsolid organ transplantation research [31].\nHypothetical application\nFigure 2 shows the hypothetical application of EVLP in a\nfictive patient with combat-related limb loss and subse\ufffequent evacuation and treatment. After infliction of the\ninjury, the patient is tactically evacuated to a Role 2 or\nRole 3 facility for damage control surgery. The ampu\ufffetated limb is preserved in static cold storage for tactical\nevacuation. The initial surgical treatment can completely\nfocus on stabilizing the patient while the limb is con\ufffenected to the ex vivo perfusion device and perfusion is\nstarted. Planning and execution of a strategic aero\ufffemedical evacuation to a Role 4 facility can be done with\ufffeout time pressure regarding limb ischemia time\nrequirements. After admission to the Role 4 facility, a\nspecialist microsurgical team can prepare the patient, as\nwell as the limb, and then perform replantation surgery\nunder highly elective conditions.\nProposed methodology\nIn terms of the actual in-field application of such a de\ufffevice, an algorithm would be as follows: After tourniquet\ntreatment of the proximal stump of the severed limb,\nthe amputated limb would be cleaned with disinfectants,\nrinsed with sodium chloride and sterilely placed on the\nperfusion device’s tray. Blunt dissection of the distal\nstump allows demonstration of the main vessels, which\nmost military surgeons are familiar with for shunting\nprocedures. A single use cannulation kit will be used to\ncannulate the arterial vessel and will be tied with either\nKaltenborn et al. Military Medical Research (2020) 7:21 Page 4 of 8\n\na suture or a snug clamp. The cannula will then be ster\ufffeilely connected to the perfusion device, with free venous\noutflow. Hypothermic perfusion with off-the-shelf acel\ufffelular perfusion solutions such as Perfadex or Steen will\nbe initiated. For the trained person, the entire procedure\nwill take approximately 15 min.\nTesting the hypothesis\nFirst, the optimal conditions for long-term EVLP need\nto be found. Studies on the metabolic condition under\nperfusion in regard to cell damage and reactions of dif\ufffeferent additives to the perfusion solution should en\ufffelighten this aspect. The influence of different perfusion\nsolutions on all affected tissues needs to be investigated,\nas well as the addition of medications (e.g., antibiotics or\ncorticosteroids), nutrition, and electrolytes. Furthermore,\nthe optimal oxygen saturation and temperature must be\ndefined.\nAs mentioned above, there are data available from\nin vivo studies in porcine models, although the results\nare limited by the short perfusion time of 24 h. In the\nmilitary setting, notably longer perfusion times need to\nbe addressed. Therefore, future animal studies must\nfocus especially on long-term perfusion, since this repre\ufffesents the military setting, considering the time for\nstabilization of the patient until evacuation to a tertiary\ntreatment center. It is of utmost importance to allow the\nshift from a katabolic to an anabolic state of metabolism\nin the amputated limb.\nRestoring the functionality of the replanted limb\nshould be a major aim for future research. In our opin\ufffeion, the identification and improvement of all relevant\nfactors for nerve regeneration are the key for successful\naftercare. Nerves are especially prone to ischemia\ufffeinduced damage which would occur within a timeframe\nof 2 h. Modern day VCA results impressively show that\nfunctionality can be excellent when the procedure is well\nprepared and performed under optimal conditions [13].\nSystematic translational and multidisciplinary research\nprojects should focus on axonal growth, nerve guidance\nstructures and microsurgical nerve reconstruction.\nPromising data are available from two interesting devel\ufffeopments in the field of nerve regeneration. The applica\ufffetion of spider silk as a guiding structure for nerve\nregeneration is an upcoming innovation. Making use of\nspider silk is an idea dating back thousands of years [32].\nFor example, it is known that cobwebs were used to stop\nbleeding in ancient Rome, and natives of the Salomon\nIslands have been using spider silk-woven fishing lines\nfor the last 300 years to catch small fish from their boats\n[33, 34]. There is strong evidence from a long-distance\nperipheral nerve gap model that spider silk enhances\nSchwann cell migration, axonal regrowth and remyelina\ufffetion, including electrophysiological recovery resulting in\nfunctional recovery (see Fig. 3) [35]. The growth of hu\ufffeman neurons on spider silk has been established and\nthere has actually been active neural cell migration and\nadhesion of neuronal cells to spider silk fibers [36].\nTherefore, it needs to be investigated whether the early\nFig. 2 Hypothetical application in a fictive patient with combat-related limb loss and subsequent evacuation and treatment (EVLP: ex vivo\nlimb perfusion)\nKaltenborn et al. Military Medical Research (2020) 7:21 Page 5 of 8\n\ncoupling of nerve ends to spider silk guiding structures\nduring EVLP can lead to an increased rate of axonal\ngrowth after replantation and allotransplantation.\nAdditionally, EVLP provides the opportunity to\napply another innovative approach. Current research\nis focused on the application of the biological poly\ufffesaccharide chitosan and chitosan-coated nerve con\ufffeduits. For short defects, chitosan-coated nerve\nconduits have already been approved for clinical ap\ufffeplications, and preoperative nerve protection with\nsuch a conduit might lead to better results in the\nlong run. Schwann cells grow exceptionally well on\nchitosan-coated surfaces, and co-cultivated neurons\nshow increased neurite development [37]. There is\nfurther evidence that monocytes from peripheral\nblood have an increased expression of M2 phenotypes\nwhen in contact with chitosan [38]. Taken together,\nthese factors might improve nerve regeneration and\ncould lead to better functional outcomes.\nThe already available data should be complemented\nwith analyses of longer periods of time. The profiles in\ufffecluding the expression of hypoxia-induced genes, the cyto\ufffekines and the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory\nfactors at molecular level would help elucidate the effects\nfurther. One focus might be the evaluation of pharma\ufffecological approaches, such as the addition of PHD in\ufffehibitors [27]. The already available and promising\nresults regarding MHC silencing should be researched\nin depth, especially regarding the major implications\nfor its application in VCA.\nA clinically applicable prototype needs to be developed\nin close cooperation with medical engineers and perfu\ufffesion specialists. There has already been experience with\nsolid organ machine perfusion and extracorporeal mem\ufffebrane oxygenation, which could be very useful during\nthe prototype development phase. The EVLP device\nneeds to address several specifications to allow its appli\ufffecation in the military setting. It needs to be easy to use\nin stressful situations, unaffected by severe climate con\ufffeditions and easy to transport, especially via air transport.\nThus, the prototype must be intensively tested in the\nfield to allow reliable clinical use. Such a device could\nalso be a breakthrough for the field of VCA.\nImplications of the hypothesis\nThe development and clinical introduction of EVLP can\naddress two challenges of modern medicine. First, there\nis a huge demand for VCA in civilian medicine. Such a\ndevice could be a breakthrough, by allowing a reasonable\ntimeframe to organize a transplant procedure, including\npatient selection, graft allocation and technical and sur\ufffegical preparation. Moreover, due to different trauma\nmechanisms in the civilian setting with less soft tissue\ndamage than in combat injuries, the chance of successful\nreplantation surgery is, per se, more likely. The Injury\nSeverity Score, which is a practical tool for depicting the\noverall trauma burden, is significantly lower in civilian\ntraumatic amputations [39]. First and foremost, we be\ufffelieve that this is the most relevant improvement for civil\ufffeian medicine associated with EVLP. Second, EVLP might\nhave a relevant impact on military medicine due to the\noutlined hypothetical implication in extremity salvage\nafter traumatic amputation, although the rate of salvage\ufffeable extremities is surely lower than that in civilian\ntrauma due the different trauma mechanisms. Neverthe\ufffeless, there is a notable number of wounded soldiers who\ncould benefit from the application of EVLP, either in the\nacute setting of traumatic amputation or during delayed\nreconstruction with VCA. Injury patterns in the combat\nsetting are associated with a high degree of soft tissue\ntrauma and a significant loss of tissue. In these cases,\nVCA is a valuable treatment option, and the widespread\navailability of VCA programs could be possible on the\nFig. 3 Demonstration of lesion side and nerve defect induction of\nperipheral nerve and construct implantation in adult sheep*.

Furthermore, recent evidence has shown\nthat chronic pain and the failure of motor neuron regen\ufffeeration lead to delayed amputations in patients with\ncombat injuries [40]. Therefore, it can be hypothesized\nthat the introduction of EVLP in the military setting\ncould lead to a drastic reduction in the number of ser\ufffevice members disabled by amputation. There is strong\nevidence that both civilians and military personnel will\nhave improved outcomes regarding psychosocial factors\nand functionality after replantation surgery when com\ufffepared to limb salvage or prosthetic treatment.\nThe availability of a trained microsurgical team that\ncan carry out a sophisticated replantation procedure is\nunlikely in most kinds of military operations. EVLP en\ufffeables replantation surgery in a Role 4 facility in the\nhome country and changes the clinical setting from a\nhighly urgent, life-threatening situation to a highly meth\ufffeodical, well-prepared starting point for optimal treat\ufffement of the wounded service member.\nIn conclusion, with the introduction of EVLP, the\nprinciple of “life before limb” will change to “life before\nlimb before elective replantation or transplantation after\nEVLP”, from which both military and civilian societies\nwill benefit.\nAbbreviations\nEVLP: Ex vivo limb perfusion; PHD: Prolyl hydroxylase domain; IRI: Ischemia\nand reperfusion-related injuries; LEAP: Lower Extremity Assessment Project;\nMETALS: Military Extremity Trauma Amputation/Limb Salvage; MHC: Major\nhistocompatibility complex; VCA: Vascularized composite tissue\nallotransplantation\nAcknowledgements\nNot applicable.\nAuthors’ contributions\nAK designed the study, wrote the manuscript, performed the literature\nreview, and is the corresponding author.

Current limitations of EVLP include a lack of standardized perfusion protocols, unknown effects of weight gain during perfusion, and uncertainty about the impacts of different perfusion solutions and temperatures on graft viability and functionality. The authors propose developing a portable, clinically applicable EVLP device to address these issues. They highlight several advantages of EVLP, including extending ischemic periods, providing surgical opportunities before replantation, and potentially reducing the risk of ischemia-reperfusion injury through the use of acellular hypothermic extracorporeal perfusion. The authors also suggest exploring the use of spider silk as a guiding biomaterial for nerve regeneration during EVLP. Overall, the authors argue that EVLP has the potential to improve outcomes for military personnel who suffer amputations due to trauma.",1.0,0.8395544602383603,FULL_PAPER

Contraindications for donation\nhave been revised in order to better meet the organ demand. The use of lower-quality\norgans and organs with greater preoperative damage, including those from donation after\ncardiac death (DCD), has become an established routine but increases the risk of graft\nmalfunction. This risk is further aggravated by ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI) in the\nprocess of transplantation. These circumstances demand a preservation technology that\nameliorates IRI and allows for assessment of viability and function prior to transplantation.\nOxygenated hypothermic and normothermic machine perfusion (MP) have emerged\nas valid novel modalities for advanced organ preservation and conditioning. Ex vivo\nprolonged lung preservation has resulted in successful transplantation of high-risk\ndonor lungs. Normothermic MP of hearts and livers has displayed safe (heart) and\nsuperior (liver) preservation in randomized controlled trials (RCT). Normothermic kidney\npreservation for 24 h was recently established. Early clinical outcomes beyond the market\nentry trials indicate bioenergetics reconditioning, improved preservation of structures\nsubject to IRI, and significant prolongation of the preservation time. The monitoring\nof perfusion parameters, the biochemical investigation of preservation fluids, and the\nassessment of tissue viability and bioenergetics function now offer a comprehensive\nassessment of organ quality and function ex situ. Gene and protein expression profiling,\ninvestigation of passenger leukocytes, and advanced imaging may further enhance the\nunderstanding of the condition of an organ during MP. In addition, MP offers a platform\nfor organ reconditioning and regeneration and hence catalyzes the clinical realization\nof tissue engineering. Organ modification may include immunological modification and\nthe generation of chimeric organs. While these ideas are not conceptually new, MP\nnow offers a platform for clinical realization. Defatting of steatotic livers, modulation\nof inflammation during preservation in lungs, vasodilatation of livers, and hepatitis C\nelimination have been successfully demonstrated in experimental and clinical trials.\nTargeted treatment of lesions and surgical treatment or graft modification have been\nattempted. In this review, we address the current state of MP and advanced organ\nmonitoring and speculate about logical future steps and how this evolution of a novel\ntechnology can result in a medial revolution.\nKeywords: transplantation, machine perfusion, marginal, graft, immunogenecity, immunomodulation,\nreconditioning, expanded criteria donor\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nINTRODUCTION\nThe velocity and significance of progress in transplantation\nstarted to decrease around the turn of the century. Up until\nthat point, the number of transplantations performed was\never-increasing, and the outcomes continued to improve. The\nclinical benefit to the patient from the immediate and effective\ntreatment of organ failure was defined by improved patient\nsurvival. Patient survival as an endpoint followed by graft survival\nas a surrogate and indicator of judicious organ attribution\nwere the framework of significant momentum that succeeded\nin making transplantation a standard of care. This success\nwas fueled, however, not only by the healthcare quality gain\nbut also by a flourishing industry producing high-quality and\nexpensive immunosuppressive medication—to be taken for life\nafter transplantation (1–3).\nThe honeymoon period came to an end when both donor\nrates and short-term results stagnated. The established endpoints\nfor clinical trials are difficult to improve in the short run\nafter transplantation, and the field was slow in anticipating\nand responding to the changing circumstances—specifically\nthe shortage of standard criteria donors (SCD). The field of\ntransplantation now finds itself in very difficult circumstances:\n90%+ patient and graft survival rates leave little room for\nimprovement but also little room for error. At the same\ntime, the conditions and circumstances in organ donation are\nradically changing, with increasing donor age and comorbidities\nand donation from non-heart-beating donors. In countries\nspearheading the evolution, donation after cardiac death (DCD)\nand extended criteria donor (ECD) organs make up more than\n50% of the organ pool. With the pressure to maintain and further\nimprove the excellent short- and long-term results, but working\nwith very different resources, the most prominent immediate\nchallenge is to better define and preserve, if not improve, organ\nquality in transplantation.\nAbbreviations: A2AR, Adenosine A2A receptor; AST, Aspartate\naminotransferase; ATP, Adenosine triphosphate; CIT, Cold ischemia time;\nCMV, Cytomegalovirus; CVA, Cerebrovascular accident; DAMP, Danger\ufffeassociated molecular pattern; DBD, Donation after brain death; DC, Dendritic\ncell; DCD, Donation after cardiac death; DGF, Delayed graft function;\nD-HOPE, Dual hypothermic oxygenated perfusion; DRI, Donor Risk Index;\nEAD, Early allograft dysfunction; ECD, Expanded criteria donor; ECMO,\nExtracorporal membrane oxygenation; EMS, Exsanguinous metabolic support;\nESP, Eurotransplant senior program; ET-1, Endothelin-1; EVLP, Ex vivo lung\nperfusion; FABP, Fatty Acid- Binding Protein 1; GFP, Green fluorescent protein;\nGST, Glutathione S-Tranferases; H-FABP, Heart-type fatty acid-binding protein;\nHOPE, Hypothermic oxygenated perfusion; HMP, Hypothermic machine\nperfusion; HMPO, Oxygenated hypothermic machine perfusion; IFNγ, Interferon\ngamma; IL-10, Interleukin-10; IRI, Ischemia-reperfusion injury; KDRI, Kidney\nDonor Risk Index; LDH, Lactate dehydrogenase; MP, Machine perfusion; MSC,\nMesenchymal stromal cells; NAG, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase; NMP,\nNormothermic machine perfusion; NK, Natural killer cell; NKT, Natural killer\nT cell; NRP, Normothermic regional perfusion; OCS, Transmedic Organ Care\nSystem; PDR, Pancreas Donor Risk Index; PGD3, Prostaglandin D3; PNF, Primary\nnon-function; PV, Pressure volume; RCT, Randomized controlled trial; ROS,\nReactive oxygen species; SCD, Standard criteria donor; SCS, Static cold storage;\nSOFT, Survival Outcomes Following Liver Transplantation score; SOP, Standard\noperating procedure; SOT, Solid organ transplantation; TNF-α, Tumor necrosis\nfactor α; UNOS, United Network for Organ Sharing; VEGF, Vascular endothelial\ngrowth factor; WIT, Warm ischemia time.\nWith this as a driving force, modalities to prolong and\nimprove preservation together with the tools to assess organ\nquality and function are emerging as the new frontier. Beyond\nserving an immediate medical need, the technologies evolving\nherald a more fundamental potential for change in healthcare:\nwith the extracorporeal long-term preservation and assessment\nof organs, the capability for human organ treatment and repair\narises. Hence, 20 years after transplantation advanced to become\na standard of care, the field has the potential to play a key role and\nadd a chapter to healthcare once again (4–10).\nIn this review, we aim to address the current state of the\nfield. A clarification of the terminology and the definitions\nof marginal organs, including an overview and comparison\nbetween the definitions for each organ, shall help to provide\na better picture of the actual status. Considering the changing\ncircumstances, the actual impacts of a condition on organ quality\nand function need to be addressed not only from the viewpoint\nof an empirical correlation. The individual parameters need to be\nfurther addressed for their reversibility and treatability. Building\non this concept, the various modalities of MP in their different\nstages of development and actual benefit require a critical\nreflection. While the assessment of organ quality and function\nduring extracorporeal perfusion is in its infancy, the growing\nbody of data may help to eventually develop a comprehensive\npicture of the quality of the components of organs as relevant to\ntransplantation and beyond. An important focus in this context\nis the assessment, definition, and relevance of the immune system\nof organs if isolated from the human body. Immunomodulation\nand immunomasking seem more realistic if attempted under\nthe conditions of an isolated and perfused organ. The vision\nof a realization and refinement of the repair, treatment, and\nmodification of organs is starting to trigger a boost in interest\nboth in academia and in industry.\nDEFINING “MARGINAL” ORGANS\nIn the light of organ shortage, critical reflection on the expansion\nof the donor pool is essential. The definition of organs that are\nmarginal for transplantation is often considered a well-defined\nentity. In reality, however, the definition is very different for each\norgan, and there is incongruence between the various definitions.\nIt is clear and well-justifiable that different organs are considered\nto be extended criteria organs going by different criteria, since the\nrelevance of one single factor may be very diverse. The assessment\nof the outcome after transplantation of extended criteria organs,\nhowever, needs to be seen and interpreted with reference to the\ndiverse definitions used throughout the years.\nECD Kidneys\nThe determination of ECD evolved from the term “marginal\ndonors,” and much of the literature focuses on criteria for living\ndonors. Since this is not the focus of this article, we will restrict\nthe research to deceased donors and deceased donor organs.\nIt is well-known that a number of factors may impact\nthe eventual outcome after transplantation. The definition of\ncadaveric kidney organs marginal for transplantation emerged\nfrom prioritization of and preference for factors that may outrank\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 2 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al.

In the deceased donor situation, the prior medical history\nis not completely known, and the exact determination of\nhypertension, for example, often remains incomplete regarding\ndetails such as manifestation, duration, or response to treatment.\nSome of the understanding of donor risk factors also stems from\nliving donors (12), where early definitions of marginal donors\nrelate to the risks for the recipient rather than the risk for the\ndonor, which was only assessed and understood much later.\nHence, the definition of marginal or ECD kidneys needs to be\nused with caution since the definitions used are building on a set\nof parameters that have not been formally established, validated,\nand re-validated.\nStill, compared to other organ systems in SOT, a comparatively\ngood definition of marginal or ECD has been established.\nNoteworthily, the term “marginal” should be avoided in favor of\nECD, as “marginal” may be considered pejorative by the patients\nwho receive them and also by the programs that transplant\nthem (13).\nThe ECD criteria most widely used in kidney transplantation\nare the OPTN-approved criteria, as described by Metzger et al.\n(13). They are shown in Table 1.\nA helpful tool that combines such parameters is the Kidney\nDonor Risk Index (KDRI), which was generated by weighting the\nfollowing factors into a single number in order to predict the risk\nof post-transplant graft failure: age, weight, height, race, history\nof hypertension, history of diabetes, cause of death, hepatitis C\nstatus, serum creatinine, and DCD. The association of KDRI\nwith the outcome in the Eurotransplant senior program (ESP)\nwas evaluated by Schamberger et al. (14). Kidney transplantation\nfrom Maastricht category-III donors after circulatory death\n(DCD), which introduces a higher risk of primary non-function\nand delayed graft function (DGF), has been added to ECD\ncriteria (15). Furthermore, kidneys from a donor with an acute\nkidney injury before organ procurement correspond to marginal\nquality (16). Importantly, kidneys from donors with a history\nof extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have not been\naddressed specifically but can be classified as marginal organs\nsince deteriorated microperfusion can be assumed (17–19).\nTABLE 2 | Common criteria defining “marginal” or “expanded criteria donor\n(ECD)” livers, as well as “ECD DCD” livers.\nDBD\nCardiac arrest (min) >15\nProlonged hypotensive periods <60 mmHg for >1 hr\nAge (yrs) >55\nBMI (kg/m2\n) >30\nHBV Positive\nHBC Positive\nBMI (kg/m2\n) 79 (100.0)\nMacrosteatosis (%) >30\nHypernatriemia (mEq/L) >155\nICU stay (days) ≥ 5 (mechanical ventilation)\nNosocomial infection Positive blood cultures or pneumonia\nSplit liver yes\nAST (U/L) >170\nALT (U/L) >140\nCIT (hrs) >12\nVasopressor drug requirement Dopamine dose >10 µg/kg/min or\nany doses of other amines)\nNon-heart-beating Yes\nDCD\nAge (yrs) >50\nBMI (kg/m2\n) >35\nFunctional WIT (min) >30\nMacrosteatosis (%) >30\nDCD, donation after cardiac death; DBD, donation after brain death; min, minutes; yrs,\nyears; hrs, hours; CIT, cold ischemia time; HBV, hepatitis B virus; HCV, hepatitis C\nvirus; BMI, body mass index; ICU, intensive care unit; AST, aspartate aminotransferase;\nALT, Alanin-aminotransferase.\nECD Livers\nIn liver transplantation, the term “marginal” does not refer to\na number of distinct internationally accepted criteria that could\ncharacterize a graft, and nor does “ECD.” Instead, both terms\nencompass a variety of factors that have been observed to limit\ngraft quality, but the impact of each of these factors remains\nto be defined. Therefore, several models for the assessment of\nthe sum of such risk factors have been introduced (20). In this\nregard, valuable predictive quality of patient and graft survival at\n3 months was achieved using the Survival Outcomes Following\nLiver Transplantation (SOFT) score (21). Death censored graft\nsurvival at 60 months follow-up was well-predicted by the Donor\nRisk Index (DRI; c-index 0.59) and Eurotransplant-DRI (c-index\n0.58) (20).\nTable 2 lists those criteria that overlap in the mentioned\nscoring systems and that are widely applied when defining\n“marginal” or “ECD” liver grafts (22, 23). Apart from clinical and\nmetric parameters, these include histological criteria, since liver\nbiopsies are considered helpful in order to evaluate the organ\nquality. Whereas, liver fibrosis has been reported to predict a\nhigh incidence of early graft failure (24), Liu et al. (25) suggested\na macrovesicular steatosis of 30 percent as a cutoff value for\nmarginal grafts.\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 3 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al.

Table 3 summarizes\nthe criteria that have been commonly used by various authors\n(27–30). In an attempt to bring such criteria into a clinically\nuseful context, Axelrod et al. (31) presented a Pancreas Donor\nRisk Index (PDR). The score builds a prediction model of graft\nsurvival on donor factors together with ischemia time and type\nof transplantation (31).\nECD Hearts\nDue to the imminent gap between the supply of donor hearts\nand the demand for transplantable organs, strategies have\nemerged to overcome this clinical dilemma. The numbers of left\nventricular assist devices as bridge-to-transplant therapy have\nsignificantly increased over the last decade. Simultaneously with\nthis trend, marginal or “extended criteria” hearts are routinely\nevaluated in order to increase the donor pool. While standardized\ncriteria have not been published by societies so far, there is a\ngeneral consensus when it comes to the definition of marginal\ndonor hearts. The literature on this topic is primarily driven\nby US data. A Meeting Report by the American Society on\nTransplantation on adult cardiac transplantation is still lacking\na unified formal definition.\nTABLE 5 | Common criteria defining standard criteria (SCD), therefore not ECD\nlung.\nAge (yrs) <55\nBMI mismatch donor/recipient (%) >20\nClear chest X-ray Yes\nPaO2 (mm Hg) >300 (FIO2 1.0,\nPEEP 5 mm Hg)\nHistory of smoking (pack yrs) <20\nAbsence of chest trauma Yes\nAbsence of microbiologic organisms endobronchial Yes\nAbsence of malignancy Yes\nAbsence of purulent secretions or signs of aspiration\nendobronchial\nYes\nNegative virology Yes\nyrs, years; BMI, body mass index; FIO2, fraction of inspired oxygen; PaO2, partial pressure\nof oxygen; PEEP, positive end-expiratory pressure.\nBased on the current literature, the factors that should be\nconsidered as extended criteria in heart donation are given in\nTable 4.\nIn order to facilitate a better risk-assessment of allografts,\ndonor profiles have been implemented in Risk Scores. Smits et al.\nhave identified 12 variables associated with donor non-use in\nthe Eurotransplant region and have generated the Eurotransplant\nHeart Donor Score (32). Based on the UNOS database, a risk\nscore model (UNOS Donor Risk Score) has been developed by\nWeiss et al. (33).\nECD Lungs\nBased on the standard criteria donor lung definitions published\nin 2003 by Orens et al. (34), one can define an ECD lung if\nthe donor does not fulfill at least one criterion of the SCD\ncriteria suggested by the International Society for Heart and Lung\nTransplantation (Table 5).\nMACHINE PERFUSION\nThe concept of MP was part of organ preservation long before\nsolid organ transplantation (SOT) started to become a clinical\nreality and routine. With the publication by Collins et al., in\nwhich the authors described a method for the transportation of\nkidneys on ice using a preservation solution with the result that\nthe organs could be shipped in a small box and showed almost\nno damage after 30 h, the era of static cold storage (SCS) had\nbegun (35). The implementation of SCS led to satisfactory results\nwithin the entire field of SOT. However, with the increasing\nuse of organs procured from ECD and DCD, SCS alone is not\nable to deliver the post-transplant results we aim to achieve for\nour patients. The lack of oxygen, the continuation of anaerobic\nmetabolism leading to organ-damage and recipient-harming\nIRI after reperfusion, is significantly pronounced and more\ndetrimental in these marginal donor organs (36).\nFigure 1 illustrates the different possibilities for combining\nall preservation techniques available today clinically for almost\nall organs: static cold storage (as the golden standard,\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 4 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nFIGURE 1 | The past, present, and potential (near) future of organ preservation. Whereas, static cold storage (SCS) has been successfully applied over decades with\ngood outcomes in standard criteria donor (SCD) organs, at present, marginal or expanded criteria donor (ECD) organs in particular are increasingly preserved by\nhypothermic (HMP) or normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) technologies. After initial cold perfusion [*and optimally following normothermic regional perfusion\n(NRP) in Donation after cardiac death (DCD) organs], machine perfusion is commenced either at the retrieval center or at the transplant center in a “back to hub”\napproach. The next step is to effectively use the prolonged preservation times of ECD grafts achieved by optimized machine perfusion protocols to characterize ECD\norgan quality and transplantability via the assessment of biomarkers. To improve graft quality, NMP provides an ideal platform for future immunomodulatory\nmodifications and organ repair.\nso far), hypothermic preservation with/without oxygen, and\nnormothermic perfusion. Normothermic regional perfusion\n(NRP) is mentioned in Figure 1, as it has become an important\ntool for use before the procurement process of DCD starts. The\nfollowing sections will not present NRP data in particular, as the\nreview is about machine preservation in marginal donor organs.\nHowever, good and satisfying results after kidney, pancreas,\nheart, and liver transplantation were reported by several groups\nin the United Kingdom, Spain, and France and have been\nsummarized by previous reviews (37–42).\nRecently, Ruiz et al. presented a series of 46 livers transplanted\nafter NRP and concluded that their results, including 23%\nearly allograft dysfunction, are superior to standard DCD organ\nprocurements and comparable to donation after brain death\n(DBD) results (43). The Cambridge group (United Kingdom),\nclear NRP proponents, commented on this publication in a way\nsimilar to our suggestions illustrated in Figure 1. The publication\nby Ruiz et al. (43), like many others before it, did not compare the\nresults to an adequate prospectively organized control group.\nIt is noteworthy that, only recently, a protocol for NRP\nwas established even for DCD heart transplantation. Due to a\nrestoration of function of the arrested heart, organ assessment via\nechocardiography, pressure-volume loops, and cardiac-output\nmeasurements could be implemented (44).\nAccepted criteria for subsequent heart transplantation after\nweaning from mechanical support are defined as: cardiac\nindex >2.5 L/min/m2\n; central venous pressure < 12 mm Hg;\npulmonary capillary wedge pressure < 12 mm Hg; left ventricular\nejection fraction > 50% in transoesophageal echocardiography.\nNRP leads to a meaningful increment of survival benefits and\nhelps to enlarge the available donor pool by utilizing marginal\ndonor organs in a safe way (45, 46). Future trials are needed to\ncompare DCD organ transplantation +/– NRP followed by +/–\na combination of preservation techniques (42, 45).\nSince 2009, dynamic cold storage—hypothermic machine\nperfusion (HMP)—has progressed to become clinical routine in\nseveral fields of SOT—above all, in kidney preservation. Moers\net al. published their landmark paper in the New England Journal\nof Medicine and demonstrated a significantly lowered DGF\nrate in recipients receiving a hypothermically perfused kidney\ncompared to a renal graft stored on ice in the common way\n(47). Applying the same technology (HMP without supplemental\noxygenation), numerous publications on DCD and ECD kidneys\nhave followed over the past 10 years, showing similar results:\nECD and DCD kidneys and their recipients clearly benefit from\nMP as long as the duration of cold ischemia time (CIT) is\nreasonable (48–52). During the second half of the recent decade,\noxygen as a supplement has been focused on for kidney HMP.\nIn 2016, Jochmans et al. published an overview of ongoing\nMP trials in kidney and liver transplantation, including those\nassessing oxygenated HMP (53). One of these trials run by the\nCOPE\nR\nconsortium (http://cope-eu.com/work%20programme/\ntrials.html) has finished recruiting, and 1-year-follow-up results\nwere presented during the American Transplant Congress 2019.\nThis international RCT on oxygenated HMP of DCD kidneys\nincluded 197 kidney pairs, of which 106 were successfully\nhypothermically perfused and transplanted. Approximately 80%\nof the transplanted kidney pairs were eligible for the primary\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 5 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nanalysis and resulted in a similar eGFR at 1 year after transplant\nfor oxygenated (HMPO) and standard HMP. Analysis of all\ufffecause graft failure, however, showed a higher eGFR in HMPO\nthan in HMP. Overall graft loss was significantly lower in HMPO,\nleading the authors to suggest that HMPO improves 1-year\nkidney graft function when accounting for the beneficial effect\non allograft survival.\nIn contrast, in the field of pancreas transplantation,\ndynamic preservation technologies have not yet experienced\na breakthrough. Neither hypothermic nor NMP technologies\nare well-established, and SCS remains the standard procedure.\nA recent review outlined nine studies on HMP and 10 studies\non NMP. All of them were experimental; none of the human\npancreatic grafts were transplanted. However, the common\nconclusion of all of the published articles considered was that\nIRI, thrombosis, and morbidity after whole organ pancreas\ntransplantation might be reduced by both technologies (54–56).\nLiver transplantation can be regarded as the field in SOT that\nprimarily focuses on the development of preservation techniques,\ncurrently. The most commonly used perfusion types in the\ndaily routine are HOPE (hypothermic oxygenated perfusion),\nD-HOPE (d for dual oxygenation via hepatic artery and portal\nvein), and normothermic liver preservation. HOPE and D\ufffeHOPE studies have produced promising results, showing higher\nadenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels during preservation, less\nIRI, excellent graft survival after DCD liver transplantation,\nand a significantly reduced rate of bile duct injuries (57–60).\nThe Birmingham group was the first to publish its experiences\non livers undergoing HOPE and NMP consecutively (61).\nAlthough such livers were not transplanted, HOPE/NMP livers\ndeveloped less oxidative injury and inflammation and achieved\nenhanced metabolic recovery compared to livers undergoing\nNMP only (61). Liver NMP had its great appearance when the\nfirst prospective international multicenter RCT was published in\nApril 2018 (62). The trial on DBD and DCD livers with NMP\ndurations up to 24 h could show a significantly lower level of graft\ninjury, measured by reduced peak aspartate aminotransferase\n(AST), longer preservation times, and a 50% lower discard rate of\norgans compared to SCS. Bile duct complications and graft and\npatient survival were comparable in both groups (62).\nNMP has been shown to be beneficial in terms of immediate\ngraft function in all organ types in which it has been explored\nclinically: this includes the kidney (63–65), liver (62, 66), and\nthe lung (67, 68). The mechanism by which this occurs has not\nyet been conclusively proven, but the concept is that reperfusion\n(rewarming and oxygen delivery) in the artificial context of the\nperfusion circuit is beneficial by allowing recovery of cellular\nenergetics in the absence of the effector mechanisms needed for\nan acute inflammatory response (as in ischemia-reperfusion).\nORGAN PRESERVATION VS. ORGAN\nCONDITIONING VS. ORGAN REPAIR\nWith a new technology, the accompanying terminology is often\nsomewhat unspecific and unprecise in the beginning. This also\napplies to MP. It is paramount, however, to eventually clarify the\nterminology and define a uniformity for its correct use. Simply\nput, no other terminology than organ preservation would be\njustified at this point in the clinical application, since no targeted\nmeans for organ reconditioning (let alone repair) have been\nestablished. While this remains a glorious goal for the future,\nit also represents a significant legal and ethical challenge, since\nthe framework for the treatment of human organs remains to\nbe established. It remains entirely unclear whether extracorporal\norgan reconditioning and/or repair can be achieved. The hope\nand the hype are building on a growing body of experimental\ndata that indicates the feasibility of success or organ-specific\ntreatment. While this remains a most significant opportunity for\nthe field, we herein aim to adequately define organ preservation,\norgan (re-)conditioning, and organ treatment.\nOrgan Preservation—A Definition\nIt is interesting to note that no entry exists on organ preservation\nin Wikipedia (search, 21.08.2019), while a PubMed search\nyields 17189 entries (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?\nterm=organ+preservation). It seems to be a term where the\ndefinition appears so clear and easy that it does not need to\nbe written down. Yet again, a uniform description of organ\npreservation is not straightforward since it is not necessarily\ndefined by organ retrieval, temperature, metabolic state, or any\nother sole condition. The one possible common ground for a\ndefinition is the purpose. Putting an organ into a state that\nallows later reactivation and restitution of its original function\nwith the aim of minimizing damage during the period of mal\ufffeand non-perfusion.\nOne essential limiting factor in the determination of the\nquality of the preservation method is the poor definition of\nendpoint for a clinical readout. Primary non-function (PNF)\nseems relatively well-defined at first glance, but the actual\ndefinitions leave room for interpretation. PNF does not indicate\nno organ function at all but rather a function insufficient to\nprevent/avoid longer-term organ replacement therapy.\nFor example, in liver transplantation, according to Ploeg\net al., PNF is defined by poor initial function, requiring re\ufffetransplantation or leading to death within 7 days after the\nprimary procedure without any identifiable cause of graft failure\n(69). Such parameters inevitably introduce non-specificity into\nthe definition. The call for the need for re-transplantation and\nthe risk for death are clinician’s calls built on medical facts, the\ninterpretation of the physician, and a projection based on the\nparameters and the experience of the doctor. Since alternatives\nare insufficiently well-established, studies relating preservation\nquality to PNF need to be read in the light of this limitation.\nWhile PNF is seen as a suitable measure for organ preservation,\nother factors impacting on the PNF rate need to be considered.\nThe fact that re-transplantation is a risk factor for PNF indicates\nthat the role of recipient factors may be underestimated (70).\nFurther to this, no clinical preservation trial can seriously build\non PNF as an endpoint, since the PNF rates reported more\nrecently are in the range of 2–5%. Primary poor function is even\nmore vague in its sufficiency as a definition and clinical endpoint.\nVery recently, Dutkowski et al. (71) critically reflected on the\ncurrent parameters used to determine the success of preservation\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 6 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nin liver transplantation trials. While the current practice might be\nreasonable in the sense that it is building on the combination of\nparameters currently best established, alternatives are needed but\nneed to be more formally established prior to considering them\nnew clinical standards.\nA Brief History\nThe original vision of organ preservation as formulated in 1813\nwas built on the continuation of circulation and blood supply\n(72). The substitution of blood with perfusion solutions led to\nprolonged successful preservation of tissues, as described by\nCarrell (73). While prolonged successful preservation of tissues\nseems plausible according to these early findings, the actual\nsuitability for transplantation remained to be established (72).\nSuccessful kidney preservation for 3 to 5 days was achieved by\nthe use of continuous perfusion with cooled, oxygenated blood\nor plasma (74). Since continuous warm perfusion, oxygenation,\nand nutrition of an organ during transportation was technically\nvery demanding, the alternative concept eventually surpassed MP\nin the 1960s. The chemical composition of advanced solutions\nfor hypothermic organ storage resulted in excellent short-term\npreservation with good outcomes after transplantation. As with\nany achievement, the good results are a blessing and a curse.\nWith patient and graft survival as the only hard endpoints for\nclinical trials, the room for improvement became very small—\nat least with standard criteria organs. The search for superior\ntechnologies found a platform for clinical realization only when\nthe results after transplantation became less convincing, with a\ngreater effect on bile ducts as a target for early damage in liver\ntransplantation (72, 75–77). The organ shortage, together with\nthe push to use lower-quality organs and organs with additional\ndamage as a result of DCD, triggered the clinical realization of\nMP in liver transplantation.\nCurrent Situation\nThe current status of organ preservation remains largely defined\nby SCS. The well-established and standardized procedures of\norgan storage in three sterile plastic bags filled with preservation\nsolution (bag 1) or saline/ringer lactate/other (bags 2/3) is well\ufffeestablished, with a relatively good understanding of the risk\naccumulating with the duration of preservation. The major\nadvantage of SCS is the safety of the procedure. Pretty much\nnothing can happen to an organ in plastic bags, on ice, in\na plastic container. The major limitations of this technique\nrelate to the fact that metabolism continues—even though\nat a very low rate—eventually resulting in the accumulation\nof succinate and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (78–81). The\nimmediate exposure to normothermia and oxygen results in an\ninflammatory response and organ-specific damage early after\ntransplantation. The mechanisms responsible for the eventual\norgan damage not only in organ transplantation but also in\nother diseases such as cardiac infarction and stroke are well\ufffeestablished but not are the focus of this review. The key question\nin the consideration of NMP as an alternative to SCS is how\neffectively the mechanisms leading to an IRI are interrupted\nthrough either immediate NMP or NMP following SCS. While\npreclinical evidence (81) and the phase II/III trial by Nasralla et al.\n(62) have delivered evidence suggesting that NMP is superior to\nSCS when applied immediately, the actual net benefit of NMP\nfollowing SCS remains to be more clearly established. While\na key elements in such assessments are the proper definition\nof and agreement in the community on suitable endpoints\nregarding the preservation quality, the accompanying benefits\nand alternative endpoints should not be overlooked. The major\nbenefit of NMP vs. SCS is the time gained with (as it appears)\na relatively safe prolongation of preservation times under close\nto physiological conditions. The ability to monitor the viability\nand function of the organ adds important parameters for decision\nmaking and significantly ameliorates the logistical challenges\nin transplantation. The benefit of transforming transplantations\ninto scheduled procedures has the potential to significantly\nenhance safety but also training and teaching in transplantation.\nOrgan Reconditioning\nThe term organ reconditioning is used in a rather unspecific\nmanner in our field. According to Wikipedia, reconditioning\nmeans “to restore to a functional state, or to a condition\nresembling the original” (search “reconditioning,” September\n2019). The way this can be read in reference to human organs\nis that no intervention aiming beyond the restoration of the\ncondition of an organ prior to retrieval (a) or beyond the optimal\n(naïve) condition of a healthy human organ (b)—depending\non how the term “original” is interpreted in this context—shall\nbe included. These two possible views already point toward\nvery different states of an organ. The way the term was used\nin the recent scientific transplant literature is in agreement\nwith repair of the immediate injury prior to and during organ\nretrieval and storage. The key element of reconditioning/repair\nas clinically applied at this point relates to the prevention of an\neventual ROS burst by mitochondria and subsequent disruption\nof ATP production, mitochondrial permeability transition pores,\nand danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) release upon\nreperfusion. An electron shift toward succinate and subsequent\nreverse electron transfer upon reperfusion is discussed as a\nmechanism of damage and target of therapy in liver HMP (82).\nNMP is suggested to mitigate post-reperfusion hyperfibrinolysis\n(83) and inflammation (84). While these may be indirect effects\nof NMP, the actual immediate therapeutic mechanisms (if any)\nmay be glycogen repletion and ATP regeneration (85). Whether\nthese mechanisms are a simple effect of the restoration of close\nto physiological conditions or specific for NMP remains to be\nestablished. It is likely, however, that the benefit of NMP is\nmostly defined by the replacement or shortening of SCS and the\nindirect effects on logistics and preparation, organ monitoring,\nand decision making. Further to this, NMP may emerge as a\nplatform enabling organ treatment, while it may not have a\ntherapeutic/reconditioning effect per se.\nOrgan Repair\nHuman organ repair, apparently, is treated as an equivalent\nto organ regeneration (Google search “human organ repair,”\nSeptember 2019). While the common understanding of organ\nrepair might be more mechanistic and that of organ regeneration\nmore biological, the distinction between the terms seems vague.\nAlbeit experimental, therapeutic interventions in lungs seem\nmost closely approaching possible clinical implementation (86).\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 7 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nBronchoalveolar lavage, surfactant replacement, and alveolar\nrecruitment maneuvers seem to positively affect organ tissue\nmorphology and organ function. A hurdle to clinical application\nmay be the legislation. Directive 2004/23/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council “on setting standards of\nquality and safety for the donation, procurement, testing,\nprocessing, preservation, storage, and distribution of human\ntissues and cells” largely focusses on tissues and not organs\nbut represents an important reference. Since preservation times\ncan be prolonged with the technologies being developed and\nurgency may no longer serve as justification for immediate\nprocessing (transplantation) without quality assurance, the legal\nframework for tissues and cells could be applied to organs.\nThe second element of the legal consideration relates to the\nelement of organ therapy. Inevitably, the issues of responsibilities\nand possession require clarification for attempts to introduce\nex vivo human organ treatment into clinical application. As\nlong as an organ is labeled as discarded because it seems\nunsuitable for immediate transplantation, the organ will not\nbe allocated to an individual, and hence considerations of\npossession and responsibilities become less demanding. Once\norgans possibly suitable for immediate transplantation have been\ntreated for reasons such as quality improvement or possibly organ\nreconditioning, the allocation process may be completed and the\nfuture recipient indicated. If and how an individual can consent\nto interventions and/or a trial involving organs will eventually\nrequire clarification.\nDirective 2010/45/EU of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council of 7 July 2010 on standards of quality and safety\nof human organs intended for transplantation (https://eur-lex.\neuropa.eu/eli/dir/2010/53/oj) does not provide much guidance\nregarding this issue.\nMACHINE PERFUSION IN CLINICAL\nPRACTICE\nSCS is a simple, safe, and cheap method to preserve and transport\norgans, and it has been successfully applied over decades with\ngood outcomes in SCD organs. However, to date, the large\ndiscrepancy between patients on the waiting lists and available\ndonor organs has forced the transplant community to cope with\nthe demand by pushing the limits and expanding the donor\npool by accepting increasing numbers of marginal organs from\nECD and reestablish DCD programs (87). Importantly, ECD and\nDCD organs have been identified to be particularly prone to IRI.\nAlthough SCS can decelerate degradation of a preserved organ,\nespecially in high risk or marginal organs, limited applicability\nis the consequence (36, 78). Attempting to overcome this issue,\nseveral MP technologies have been developed and now find their\nway into clinical practice in SOT.\nHMP of the Liver\nLiver HMP has been translated from the experimental state to\nclinical reality over the last decade. In 2010, the first phase I\nprospective cohort study was published, reporting on 20 patients\nwho underwent liver transplantation of grafts preserved by non\ufffeoxygenated HMP. Outcomes were compared to a matched SCS\ncontrol group. HMP time ranged from 2 to 7 h, with a total\nCIT below 12 h. Except for a significantly lower peak serum\nAST in the HMP group, no further significant differences were\nobserved in regard to PNF, early allograft dysfunction, or graft\nand patient survival. However, clinical feasibility, as well as non\ufffeinferiority to SCS, was proven, making way for further studies\n(88). Five years thereafter, the same group showed promising\nresults by transplanting 31 ECD livers declined by the United\nNetwork for Organ Sharing (UNOS) region and preserved under\nhypothermic dynamic conditions at 4–8◦C. Compared to well\ufffematched SCS controls, significantly fewer biliary complications\nand shorter hospital stays were observed. This study represents a\nlandmark, since the effectiveness of MP was shown within the\nmost susceptible livers in the donor pool (89). The impact of\nHMP on marginal organs was further investigated by Dutkowski\net al. In an international matched-case analysis, 25 DCD livers\nwere subjected to HOPE and compared to matched SCS DCD\nlivers. HOPE resulted in a significant reduction of ischemic\ncholangiopathy (HOPE: 20% vs. SCS: 46%) as well as a significant\nimprovement of 1-year graft survival rates (90 vs. 69%) (58).\nThe beneficial effect of HMP on DCD grafts was confirmed by a\nprospective case-control liver transplantation study, comparing\n10 grafts with at least 2 h of DHOPE to 20 grafts without.\nAn 11-fold increase in cellular ATP during oxygenation was\ndocumented. In addition to good early graft function, both 6-\nmonth and 1-year graft survival were 100%, while 6-month graft\nsurvival and 1-year graft and patient survival in the control group\nwere 80, 67, and 85%, respectively (57). Moreover, the same\ngroup could demonstrate an attenuation of IRI-associated bile\nduct damage after transplantation of DCD end-ischemic DHOPE\nliver grafts (90).\nHOPE in particular has evolved to become a widely used\ntechnology, showing excellent longer-term results. Schlegel et al.\nprovided data on 5-year outcomes of patients receiving DCD\nlivers preserved with 1–2 h of end-ischemic HOPE (n = 50)\nand compared them to the equal numbers of DCD liver\ntransplants without HOPE or DBD liver transplantations. Five\ufffeyear outcomes of HOPE-treated DCD liver transplants were\nsimilar to those of DBD primary transplants and superior to those\nof untreated DCD liver transplants (HOPE DCD 94% vs. SCS\nDCD 78%) (91).\nNMP of the Liver\nPreserving an organ under physiological conditions is the ideal\ncondition to prevent deleterious effects of ischemia as well as\nIRI following SOT. Similar to HMP, NMP has recently been\nimplemented in clinical routine at a variety of centers. The\ntransfer from the experimental stage to clinical application\nwas first described by Ravikumar et al. in 2016. In this phase\n1 (first-in-man), non-randomized prospective trial, short-term\noutcomes of 20 recipients of NMP-perfused donor livers were\nmatched in a ratio of 1:2 to cold-stored livers. In the study group,\nlivers were preserved under normothermic conditions over the\nentire preservation period (ranging from 3.5 to 18.5 h).

Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nno differences regarding short-term recipient survival, PNF rate,\nor early allograft dysfunction were observed. Therefore, the safety\nand feasibility of this dynamic preservation method could be\nconfirmed, opening the field for further clinical investigations\nwith major implications on logistics (66).\nFeasibility and reproducibility following transplantation were\nfurther underlined in a U.S. phase I non-randomized pilot study\n(92). However, this trial also pointed out that NMP of an organ\nis not a trivial procedure and runs the risk of graft loss if\nhuman/technical errors occur. Out of 10 procured livers, one\norgan had to be promptly discarded due to an unrecognized\nportal vein twist. The remaining nine organs (four DCD\nMaastricht class III, 5 DBD) were successfully transplanted, and\noutcomes were comparable to matched control liver transplant\nrecipients of SCS grafts. The proof of concept and feasibility gave\nway for larger-scale trials.\nNasralla et al. were first to perform RCT to test the efficacy\nof NMP vs. SCS. After informed consent had been obtained\nfrom the recipient, the allocated liver was either randomized to\nSCS or NMP. NMP was performed over the entire preservation\nperiod. Outcomes of 121 NMP-graft recipients were compared to\noutcomes from 101 well-matched SCS-graft recipients. The key\nfindings of this study were a significantly reduced peak serum\nAST, a significant reduction of post-reperfusion syndrome, and\na 72% lower adjusted odds rate of developing early allograft\ndysfunction (EAD) in the NMP liver recipients compared to\ncontrols. Furthermore, NMP of the liver graft resulted in\nincreased organ utilization with a 50% lower discard rate in this\ngroup (62).\nThe additional positive effect of NMP is the “almost”\nphysiological aspect of this method, which opens up new\npossibilities by means of organ assessment and organ selection.\nThis fact was a matter of investigation in an observational\nstudy, where livers considered unsuitable for transplantation\nas well as highest risk liver were included. In total, 47 livers\nwere biochemically assessed during the preservation, resulting\nin 39 liver transplants. Remarkably, two out of 19 livers deemed\nunsuitable were transplanted (93).\nIn summary, both HMP/HOPE and NMP are accepted\nand clinically established preservation methods, particularly\ninteresting in the preservation and preconditioning of high-risk\norgans. Especially in this organ category, including ECD and\nDCD livers, they have both been shown to be superior to SCS.\nWhether HMP/HOPE or HMP is superior to the other is still a\nmatter of debate since the two methods have not been correlated\nwith each other in clinical settings, and further RCTs are needed.\nHMP of the Kidney\nThe amount of clinical evidence for dynamic preservation of\nkidney grafts is rapidly increasing. Moers et al. were first to\nperform an international RCT on hypothermically perfused\nkidneys for transplantation. One kidney from 336 deceased\ndonors was randomly assigned to HMP, and the other to SCS. A\nreduced risk of DGF and improved graft survival in favor of MP\ufffepreserved organs was shown (47). These promising results were\nconfirmed in a subsequent RCT from the Eurotransplant region.\nJochmans et al. investigated the efficacy of HMP in preserving\nDCD kidneys. Similar to Moers et al., DCD kidneys were assigned\nin a 1:1 match to HMP or SCS, resulting in a total of 164 kidney\ntransplants (82 HMP vs. 82 SCS). HMP resulted in a significantly\nreduced DGF rate as well as better early graft function after\n1 month compared to SCS. However, 1-year graft survival was\ncomparable in both groups (49).\nFurthermore, in another RCT, kidneys were either preserved\nby HMP or SCS. In accordance with Moers as well as\nJochmans, the primary end-point was the occurrence of DGF.\nSecondary endpoints were primary non-function as well as graft\nsurvival. Both the risk of DGF and the incidence of non\ufffefunction were significantly reduced by HMP in their cohort.\nOne-year graft survival and function could be improved by\ndynamic cold graft preservation (52). Despite these findings,\nthe importance of different factors such as the impact of CIT\nand the combination of CIT with HMP have to be mentioned.\nCIT is a known independent risk factor for DGF. In order\nto investigate which kidney graft may further benefit from\nHMP prior to transplantation, Kox et al. analyzed prospectively\ncollected data from the “Machine Perfusion Trial.” A total of 752\nrenal transplants were included with 376 dynamically preserved\nkidneys and 376 statically preserved grafts. They identified CIT\nas an independent risk factor for DGF. Furthermore, HMP did\nnot prevent DGF if CIT exceeded 10 h (51).\nThe optimal timepoint for, as well as the optimal duration of,\nHMP is still a matter of debate. HMP can be used either as a\nprimary preservation method or in the end-ischemic phase as\na reconditioning tool. Matos et al. were able to show a faster\nrecovery of renal function if grafts were subjected to HMP prior\nto transplantation after a mean SCS period of 22 h. MP time was\nat least 6 h. However, this beneficial effect was limited to donors\nunder the age of 50, who represent a rather selective group (94).\nFurther studies followed, indicating a beneficial effect of MP in\nthe end-ischemic phase by displaying a reduction of DGF, as\nwell as an improved organ acceptance. This last positive trend is\nattributed mainly to the possibility of organ monitoring (95, 96).\nNMP of the Kidney\nNMP of the kidney may eventually resolve many issues\nrelated to damage induced by ischemic phases. The idea of\npreserving kidney grafts under almost physiological conditions\nwith the possibility of real-life assessment of the graft prior to\ntransplantation sounds intriguing. However, while the number\nof preclinical studies using animal models as well as discarded\nhuman kidneys is steadily increasing, evidence for NMP of\nthe kidney in a clinical setting is rather poor. Hosgood et al.\nwere first to transform preclinical experience into clinical reality\nby transplanting a 62-year-old ECD kidney into a 55-year old\nrecipient. After 11 h of SCS, the graft was perfused with a\nplasma-free red cell-based solution at 33.9◦C for 35 min prior\nto transplantation. Although a slow graft function was observed,\nthe patient remained dialysis free with a serum creatinine level\nof 132 µmol/L at 3 months post-transplantation. In contrast, the\nrecipient of the opposite kidney developed DGF (64). Based on\nthis first success, the Leicester group translated NMP into clinical\nreality on a larger scale. Eighteen ECD kidneys were subjected to\nNMP reconditioning prior to transplantation. The average NMP\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 9 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\ntime was prolonged to 63 min. Outcomes were compared to 47\nmatched ECD kidneys preserved by SCS. In this study, NMP\nresulted in a significantly reduced DGF rate compared to controls\n(NMP: 5.6% vs. SCS: 36.2%). However, no differences could be\nobserved in regard to 1-year graft or patient survival (97).\nTaken together, HMP of the kidney has been shown to have its\nplace, especially in the preservation of marginal grafts, including\ngrafts from DCD and ECD, with superior outcomes in the early\nphase compared to SCS. However, CIT is still the limiting factor\ninfluencing short- as well as long-term outcomes. In contrast,\nalthough the amount of preclinical data is rapidly increasing,\nNMP is still in its early phase. However, feasibility and non\ufffeinferiority to SCS have been described at this early stage, and\nmulticenter RCTs are planned.\nMachine Preservation of the Pancreas\nIn contrast to the dynamic preservation of liver and kidney,\npancreatic MP is challenging. This is attributed to the physiologic\nas well as the anatomical characteristics of the pancreatic graft\n(98). MP of pancreatic grafts poses major challenges due to the\nsusceptibility of the organ to IRI-associated alterations, including\nacinar necrosis, edema formation, and endothelial disruption.\nThese factors in particular are recognized risk factors for early\ngraft pancreatitis and thrombosis, eventually resulting in graft\nloss (98, 99).\nIn contrast to the liver as well as the kidney, the\npancreas is characterized by a low-flow and low-pressure\nenvironment, which impedes the direct translation of the existing\nperfusion machines for use in dynamic pancreas preservation\n(100). However, the feasibility of pancreatic HMP has been\ndemonstrated in several experimental settings involving the\npreservation of porcine, dog, and discarded human pancreas\ngrafts (55, 101, 102). Although results are promising in this\nexperimental setting, clinical translation is still pending.\nTherefore, assessment and evaluation of a pancreatic graft\nprior to transplantation would be of the utmost importance,\nsince changes in donor demographics result in an increased\nneed for the acceptance of higher-risk grafts at high-volume\ncenters. However, MP of pancreatic grafts must still be considered\nexperimental at this stage.\nMachine Preservation of the Lung\nDue to pre- and peri-retrieval management and direct\nexamination of the donor organ by the explant surgeon, some\nextended criteria organs can be directly used with acceptable risk\nfor the recipient, but a notable number are rejected during the\nretrieval process. There is still a lack of clear decision criteria\nfor lung suitability for transplantation or attempts at lung\nreconditioning using an ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) (103).\nNeedless to say, MP could improve organ availability, which is\ncritically needed in the face of a waitlist mortality that is reported\nto be up to 30% depending on the allocation system (104).\nImportantly, ex vivo prolonged lung preservation resulted in\nsuccessful transplantation of high-risk donor lungs (105), and\nMP is now indispensable for evaluating lung graft quality from\nan uncontrolled DCD (106). Very promising data have come\nfrom experimental EVLP studies, which are outlined later in\nthis article.\nMachine Preservation of the Heart\nAt present, SCS of donor hearts remains the standard practice\nin most transplant units, whereas MP is limited to a few centers\nin the US and Europe. To date, only one device is available for\nclinical use—the Transmedic Organ Care System (OCS) Heart.\nAt mild hypothermia (34◦C), the system uses a combination of\ndonor blood and a proprietary solution as perfusate for the heart.\nIn 2014, heart NMP has led to the first distant procurement DCD\nheart transplantation. To date, over 100 DCD heart transplants\nhave been performed using a cardiac perfusion system (107), and\nMP of hearts exhibited safe preservation in RCTs (108).\nEX VIVO MONITORING OF ORGAN\nFUNCTION AND QUALITY\nCurrently, the decision as to whether organs are suitable for\ntransplantation is determined on the basis of more or less\nsubjective empirically established clinical parameters that have\nbeen shown to be associated with an increased rate of early\nallograft dysfunction or graft failure. Parameters such as donor\npast medical history, last known laboratory values, findings\nduring procurement, and other procurement variables such as\nexpected ischemia times primarily determine the acceptability\nof a graft. These parameters include prolonged warm ischemia\ntime (WIT) >30 min during DCD, prolonged CIT, and\nparenchymal alterations within the graft (e.g., steatosis, fibrosis,\narteriosclerosis). Viability testing and functional assessment\nprior to transplantation are likely to extend the utilization of\nsuboptimal or marginal organs (109–111).\nHMP is an alternative method to standard SCS for the\npreservation of organs. For different types of kidney grafts, HMP\noffers superior preservation compared with SCS. In terms of graft\nquality assessment during HMP, some biochemical parameters of\nthe released perfusate and hydrodynamic parameters are found\nto independently correlate with the outcome—a finding that may\nhelp clinicians in their decision making.\nIncreased Glutathione S-Tranferase (GST), N-acetyl-beta-D\ufffeglucosaminidase (NAG), heart-type fatty acid-binding protein\n(H-FABP), or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations\nduring MP may serve as indicators for suboptimal graft quality.\nFurthermore, levels of redox-active iron measured in the\nperfusate have been correlated with DGF rates (112–114).\nMoreover, the measurement of vascular resistance during MP\nrepresents an additional and objective source of information\nthat can assist clinicians in their decision-making process.\nHigh vascular resistance as a hydrodynamic parameter has\nbeen shown to be associated with an increased risk of DGF\ndevelopment and predictive for 1-year graft failure (115–117).\nTaken together, to date, increased vascular resistance and high\ninjury marker concentrations in the perfusate are risk factors for\nDGF and helpful parameters, but they are not accurate enough\nto justify a decision for discard based on their interpretation\nalone (112–114, 117).\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 10 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nConcerning kidney NMP, a scoring system has been\ndeveloped by Hosgood and Nicholson. The decision on whether\nto transplant an NMP-kidney was based on macroscopic\nappearance, renal blood flow, and total urine output during\nNMP. The authors conclude that, currently, a high percentage of\nretrieved kidneys are being unnecessarily discarded (80, 118).\nCompared to the kidney, data on liver monitoring during\nHMP remain scarce, although recent publications suggest\npromising parameters. A correlation between the AST levels\nin the perfusate during HMP and the peak of AST after liver\ntransplantation has been described. Furthermore, during HMP\nof porcine livers, a cumulative release of Fatty Acid- Binding\nProtein 1 (FABP) or AST may be represented by a linear or\nlogarithmic equation, respectively. Each equation is characterized\nby a b-coefficient that is able to discriminate between livers likely\nto fail. Similarly, during HMP of human livers discarded for\ntransplantation, AST release in the perfusate could discriminate\nbetween livers suitable for transplantation and unsuitable ones.\nMore sophisticated methods to determine graft viability include\nevaluation of ATP content assessed by magnetic resonance\nimaging and spectroscopy (89, 91, 119–121). In this regard, van\nRijn et al. used cellular ATP content during oxygenated dual\n(arterial and portal perfusion) HMP as a viability marker for liver\ngrafts. Cellular ATP content correlated with biochemical function\nearly after transplantation (57).\nFurthermore, there is evidence that a decline in arterial flow\nin a pressure-controlled system of MP can be used as a marker\nfor decreasing graft viability. However, in general, it cannot be\nadvised to use flow values as an indicator of liver damage and\nviability during human liver MP (61, 91, 122).\nConcerning NMP of liver grafts, this technology has been\napplied with promising results for utilization and outcomes\n(62, 66, 92, 123–126), and the option for the assessment of\nliver viability during NMP has been highlighted. Imber et al.\n(127) suggested that bile production is directly associated with\nliver viability. Matton et al. (128) were able to show that a\nbiliary bicarbonate concentration greater than 18 mmol/L has a\nhigh negative predictive value in terms of histological bile duct\ninjury. Moreover, biliary pH greater than 7.48, biliary glucose\nconcentration less than 16 mmol/L, bile/perfusate glucose\nconcentration ratio less than 0.67, and biliary LDH concentration\nless than 3,689 U/L may serve as indicators for high biliary\nviability. Watson et al. (93) published their experience of\ntransplanting declined livers following NMP and graft viability\nassessment. They observed that NMP resulted in a reduced\nincidence of post-reperfusion syndrome and described biliary\npH as a predictive marker for post-transplant cholangiopathy.\nPerfusate lactate and transaminases and bile production during\nNMP were suggested by Op den Dries et al. (129) to serve\nas viability markers. Recently, Mergental et al. (130) published\nviability criteria (applicable within 3 h of perfusion) for livers\nconsidered suitable for transplantation. These include lactate\nclearance, bile production, PH- homeostasis, and stable pressure\nand flow dynamics of the graft.\nThere is growing evidence that hepatic ATP content may serve\nas a viability marker. In clinical studies, hepatic ATP levels prior\nto organ retrieval or during preservation correlated with primary\nliver function after transplantation. Bruisma et al. showed\nthat differences in mitochondrial respiration and restoration of\ncellular ATP contents are possible viability markers in the setting\nof NMP. Moreover, NMP offers the option to perform dynamic\nmetabolomic analyses in both bile samples and sequential liver\nbiopsies (111, 131).\nHowever, although these results seem impressive, none of the\nabove-mentioned viability markers have been validated in larger\nstudies, and the small numbers of patients included in the studies\nmake it difficult to draw robust conclusions.\nRegarding a potential viability assessment of human pancreas\ngrafts during HMP, flow indices and histological assessment\nof duodenal and pancreas-parenchyma biopsies throughout the\nperfusion duration have been proposed. Branchereau et al.\ndescribed an absence of edema, a decrease in resistance indices,\nand normal staining for insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin as\nmarkers for good graft quality (56, 101). Barlow et al. suggested\nthe assessment of amylase levels in the perfusate, fat infiltration\n(detected using standard histology), and exocrine pancreas\nfunction as criteria to assess graft viability during NMP (55).\nConcerning heart transplantation, organ assessment during\nNMP mainly relies on metabolic parameters and measurements\nof lactate levels in the aortic root and pulmonary artery. In the\nPROCEED II trial, three hearts were discarded due to rising total\nperfusate lactate concentrations. Histopathological examination\nshowed myocardial injury (necrosis, hemorrhage, scarring) or\nleft ventricular hypertrophy in those organs (108). Calculations\nof pressure volume loops in the left and right ventricle\nhave been described by switching the heart into a “working\nmode” during NMP. Based on pressure-volume (PV) loop data,\nend-systolic elastance could be calculated as a parameter for\nventricular contractility (44, 132). Due to complicated clinical\ninterpretation and difficulties in reproducibility, “working mode”\nhas been removed from the OCS perfusion module. Contrast\nechocardiography or intravascular ultrasound of coronary\narteries might emerge as tools for anatomical and mechanical\nassessment during NMP but have not been implemented in\nclinical routine so far.\nIn EVLP, assessment of the organ relies primarily on\nfunctional and macroscopic parameters, as has been reviewed\nrecently (103). Adequate gas exchange, stable hemodynamic\nand ventilatory parameters, macroscopic evaluation (absence\nof oedema), bronchoscopy (absence of purulent secretion and\nerythema of the bronchus), and deflation after endotracheal\ntube disconnection (collapse test) during the evaluation period\nare the commonly used decision criteria for acceptance of the\nlung. Yet these criteria are not standardized and differ between\ntransplant centers (103). As physiological parameters are in\nthe lead for decision making in EVLP, clinical single-center\nstudies assessed different biomarkers and metabolic parameters\nof the perfusate or the bronchioalveolar lavage to predict organ\nacceptance and occurrence of early prostaglandin D3 (PGD3).\nMachuca et al. (133) showed that high levels of endothelin-1 (ET\ufffe1) and Big ET-1 measured in perfusate samples have prognostic\nvalue for decline in the lung because of subsequent development\nof poor physiological performance. Subsequently, the same group\nsuggested IL-8 as a powerful predictor for early graft dysfunction\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 11 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\n(134). Furthermore, IL-1β and IL-8 levels measured in the\nperfusate during EVLP were reported to inversely correlate with\nthe recipient oxygenation 24 h post-transplantation (135).\nInterestingly, given the observation that perfusate IL-1β and\nTNF-α at 30 min during EVLP were effective markers for\ndifferentiating between in-hospital survival and non-survival\npost-transplant, blocking the IL-1β pathway during EVLP\nmight reduce endothelial activation and subsequent neutrophil\nadhesion on reperfusion (136).\nIMMUNOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF\n(MARGINAL) ORGANS DURING MACHINE\nPERFUSION\nThe definition of marginal organs per se is a rather arbitrary one.\nThe most commonly used is the dichotomy between standard\ncriteria (SCD) and extended criteria donors (ECD), which is\nsimply discriminated by age and three donor criteria for the DBD\n(and, increasingly, DCD) kidney cohort (13, 137, 138). However,\nin clinical routine, it is not always straightforward to decide if an\norgan is within “standard criteria,” as there are plethora of factors\ninterfering with organ quality, i.e., estimated duration of CIT,\n(functional) WIT, or the grade of steatosis in liver and pancreas,\njust to mention a few.\nWhen we focus on the donor age only, a vast amount of\nliterature exists. There is evidence that the immunogenicity\nof elderly organs is increased, as it is believed that aging in\ncombination with injuries (i.e., brain death) induces a pro\ufffeinflammatory environment, which could lead to an activation\nof innate and adaptive immune responses (139–141). Aging\ninfluences cellular repair mechanisms, and it is known that\nthe number of MHC molecules present on the cellular\nsurface is increased by aged parenchymal cells (139). In\nexperimental studies, transplantation of elderly organs was\nassociated with a more powerful early immune response\ncompared to transplantation of younger ones. Recipients of\nsuch old grafts presented with a higher concentration of\neffector/memory T-cells with an increased alloreactivity, leading\nto acute rejection, which results in a particular high burden\nof damage for the older donor organ (140). Elderly organs do\nnot have the same repair mechanism capabilities, so the clinical\ndamage of acute rejection leaves a more severe defect, explaining\nthe increased rates of DGF and/or graft loss in this donor\ncohort (140, 142).\nAn alteration of immunogenicity in aging organs could be\none reason to focus on preservation techniques (143) such\nas HMP and NMP to learn more about the process or even\nto (re-)condition an organ for reperfusion in the recipient.\nDue to the fact that the reconstitution of a near-physiological\nenvironment might work best to study immune cells, the\nfollowing paragraphs will bring NMP into focus.\nHuman organs are equipped with a sophisticated resident\nimmune system. The kidney, for example, not only hosts tissue\uffferesident macrophages (144); the organ also harbors lymphocytes,\ninnate lymphoid cells, natural killer (NK) cells, natural killer T\n(NKT) cells, and γδ T cells (145). The residential immune cells\nof human organs remain in a balanced homeostatic state unless\nthey are stimulated—by the insult of brain death in an organ\ndonor, for example—when an immunological activation might be\ninduced. Such a response to a significant injury like brain death in\nan organ donor includes both local and systemic inflammation,\ncomprising cellular infiltrates and a cytokine storm (146).\nWith the current gold-standard preservation technologies such\nas SCS, the organs will be transplanted unchanged, in an\nimmunologically activated status, into recipients in whom\nalloantigens will trigger another immune response immediately\nafter reperfusion, presented by donor-derived antigen presenting\ncells to recipient T cells (147, 148). How important donor\ufffederived leukocytes are in the allorecognition and rejection\nprocesses was demonstrated by Lechler and Batchelor years\nago. They impressively showed that placing a rat kidney into\nan intermediate recipient before implanting it into the final\nrecipient could significantly prolong allograft survival. These\nexperiments demonstrated that “clearing” the organ of dendritic\ncells (DC), the “passenger leukocytes” responsible for activating\nrecipient T cells, by using the intermediate rat led to the desired\nsuccess (149, 150). “Parking” the organ in an interim host\nis not a feasible strategy for implementation in the clinical\nroutine. However, NMP offers the possibility to represent the\nintermediate recipient as a conditioning tool to achieve the same\nend result, as previously published by Lechler et al. (150). An\nex vivo setting might provide not only a more physiological\npreservation method but also the ability to assess the organ\nprior to transplantation and to investigate its immunological\ncharacteristics in isolation (42).\nOne of the leading groups analyzing marginal and SCD\norgans after ex vivo perfusion is the Manchester group around\nFildes and Stone. Already in 2015, they compared the clinical\noutcome of patients transplanted with marginal donor lungs\nafter undergoing EVLP compared to standard transplantation\nof acceptable lungs (151). Despite having transplanted marginal\nlungs, there was no significant difference in the clinical outcome\nup to 12 months after transplantation concerning the overall\nincidence of acute rejection and the number of treated infection\nepisodes (151). This work was followed by a study on passenger\nleukocyte migration from donor lungs into the recipients and\nthe effects of donor leukocyte depletion prior to transplantation\nusing EVLP (152). In this experimental work using a porcine\nmodel, Stone et al. illustrated that donor leukocyte transfer\ninto the recipient was reduced by EVLP and therefore reduces\ndirect allorecognition and T-cell priming (152). The same group\ntransferred their experience to an ex vivo NMP model to analyze\ndonor-derived leukocytes in a porcine renal transplantation\nmodel. Stone et al. were able to demonstrate that an inflammatory\ncytokine storm and the release of mitochondrial and genomic\nDNA were initiated in the NMP circuit prior to transplantation.\nHowever, the renal function was not impacted at all after\ntransplanting those organs. They suggest that NMP could be used\nto immunodeplete and to saturate the capacity of inflammation\nof donor kidneys before transplanting them (152). Amin et al.\n(153) evaluated the impact of a post-SCS-preservation flush on\nthe inflammatory burden of a limb allograft (a porcine model for\nvascularized composite allotransplantation). The venous effluent\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 12 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nafter flushing the limbs following either 2 or 6 h of SCS comprised\na large population of viable leukocytes, significant concentrations\nof pro-inflammatory cytokines and mitochondrial DNA. These\nresults support the hypothesis that flushing or dynamically\npreserving the organs prior to transplantation impacts the\ninflammatory burden otherwise transferred to the recipient upon\nreperfusion unchanged (153).\nLiver NMP has recently been implemented as a standard\nprocedure in the United Kingdom and been shown to improve\norgan utilization and post-transplant outcomes following phase I\nand phase III prospective randomized trials (62, 66). Jassem et al.\n(84) transplanted, compared, and analyzed 12 NMP-preserved\nlivers against 27 SCS-preserved livers to assess the impact of NMP\non IRI, necrosis, platelet deposition, neutrophil infiltration, and\nthe degree of steatosis after NMP or SCS pre- and post-perfusion.\nTheir results showed that, with NMP, there were altered gene\ufffeexpression profiles of liver tissue from pro-inflammation to\nregeneration, reduced numbers of interferon gamma (IFNγ)-\nand interleukin-17-producing T cells, and an enlarged pool\nof regulatory T cells. In addition, NMP liver tissue was less\nnecrotic and apoptotic compared to SCS-preserved livers, with\nless neutrophils infiltrating the periportal area (84).\nOverall, with the clinical and experimental evidence gained\nso far for the field of SOT, dynamic preservation methods -\nand NMP in particular - provide the means to introduce\norgan conditioning so as to lower immunogenicity as well as\npro-inflammatory markers while ensuring the promotion of\ngraft regeneration.\nIMMUNOMODULATION DURING MP\nMachine perfusion (MP) offers a previously non-existent link\nbetween basic and clinical science. The opportunity to treat an\norgan during preservation creates a new field of translational\nresearch. In this context, one of the main targets that can now\nbe addressed is the modulation of the immunogenicity of a\nspecific graft. In theory, such immunomodulation could allow the\nobviation of lifelong immunosuppression or even forge a path to\nthe holy grail in transplantation—the achievement of tolerance.\nImportantly, MP offers a platform to apply immunomodulatory\nstrategies that have been elucidated in in vitro or preclinical\nmodels in the past.\nIn the existing literature, three major such strategies have\nbeen investigated, which are discussed herein. One of the\nmost promising is the application of stem or progenitor\ncells, with the potential to suppress immunogenicity and help\nrepair injured tissue. Another strategy is the administration of\nanti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory drugs and agents, and,\nfinally, gene transduction by adenoviral vector gene delivery.\nThe majority of studies have been carried out under\nnormothermic conditions. However, oxygenated perfusion of\na graft per se seems not only to protect against preservation\ninjury but also to downregulate the immune system and\nblunt the alloimmune response, as was shown in a rodent\nmodel of hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) (154). In\nparticular, the constant flow of fluids in the vessels during MP is\nregarded to promote the expression of vasoprotective endothelial\ngenes, alleviating the microcirculatory failure associated with\nischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) (155–157). On the other\nhand, when it comes to additional modification, it is perfusion\nunder normothermic conditions that seems to represent the\nideal platform, since NMP grants a physiological metabolic\nstate (81, 158–160).\nMany of the ongoing studies addressing the field of\nimmunomodulation during MP are carried out in a porcine\nsetting, as pigs have appropriate size and anatomy as well\nas immunologic characteristics (161). Whereas, much of our\nknowledge on organ preservation is derived from various animal\nstudies (162), the porcine model above all has now evolved\nas an ideal model, making ex vivo porcine organ perfusion\nmodels a suitable platform for translational transplant research.\nAccording to a recent review, in 2017, 22 articles discussed ex\nvivo porcine organ perfusion within the context of transplant\npreservation surgery (162), but the number of articles has steadily\nincreased since then. However, also in this setting, it is important\nto highlight potential limitations when translating experiences\nbetween species (158).\nStem and Progenitor Cells\nSeveral candidate cells have been investigated, including stromal\nmesenchymal cells (MSCs), induced adult pluripotent stem cells,\nfetal stem cells from placenta, membranes, amniotic fluid, and\numbilical cord, and hematopoietic cells (163). Among these,\nMSCs have been reported to represent the most promising cell\nsubset. MSCs are multipotent cells that are found in adult tissues,\nincluding adipose tissue and bone marrow, where they support\nfunction and repair. Importantly, they have been shown to abate\nimmune and inflammatory responses via the release of paracrine\neffectors (164, 165).\nThis circumstance has led to a broad application of MSCs in\na variety of pathologies. Therefore, a prerequisite for research\non MSCs is the agreement on criteria that define these cells and\nallow comparability between studies. The International Society\nfor Cellular Therapy has established the minimum criteria that\na cell must meet to be considered an MSC: first, an MSC\nmust be plastic-adherent when maintained in standard culture\nconditions; second, an MSC must express CD105, CD73, and\nCD90 and lack expression of CD45, CD34, CD14 or CD11b,\nCD79alpha or CD19, and HLA-DR surface molecules; third, an\nMSC must differentiate into cell types of mesodermal origin in\nvitro (166, 167).\nThe fact that MSCs are known for their potent anti\ufffeinflammatory and regenerative capacities, combined with the\nfinding that a therapeutic effect can be achieved with either\nautologous or allogeneic MSCs (168), has led to the conduction of\nseveral studies investigating whether their application is feasible\nin the context of MP. However, the detailed mechanisms by\nwhich MSCs exert their anti-inflammatory and regenerative\npotential have not yet been depicted. The main mechanism of\naction is supposed to rely on secreted mediators. Therefore, an\nappropriate timeframe is likely to be required for these cells\nin order to mediate beneficial effects (169). This hypothesis is\nunderlined by the findings of a recent study in a porcine ex\nvivo lung perfusion (EVLP) model. Twelve-hour NMP of DCD\nlungs with intravascular delivery of MSCs (150 × 106\n) resulted\nin reduced levels of interleukin-8 (IL-8), a pro-inflammatory\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 13 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\ncytokine associated with reperfusion injury, along with increased\nlevels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (170). The\nfact that IL-8 was suppressed is of particular note, since MSCs are\nknown to produce the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which\nin turn has been reported to significantly suppress the production\nof IL-8 in a dose-dependent manner (169).\nIn human kidneys, Brasile et al. demonstrated actual\nrenal regeneration mediated by MSCs under 24 h of ex vivo\nnormothermic perfusion. The authors used an exsanguinous\nmetabolic support (EMS) tissue-engineering platform to study\nfive pairs of kidney allografts from DCD donors. Whereas, one\nkidney of each pair solely underwent perfusion, the partner\nkidney was EMS perfused with MSC (1 × 10). Indeed, a reduced\ninflammatory response was observed along with increased\nsynthesis of adenosine triphosphate and growth factors and a\nnormalization of the cytoskeleton and mitosis (171).\nEven though these findings are promising, more insight\nneeds to be gained regarding the effects of the NMP milieu\non MSC themselves and the comparability between human\nand porcine data. These aspects were highlighted in a kidney\nNMP model, showing that while the suspension conditions\nreduced the viability of porcine MSC by 40% in both perfusion\nfluid and culture medium, the viability of human MSC was\nreduced by suspension conditions by 15% in perfusion fluid,\nand no differences were found in survival in culture medium.\nFurthermore, it was shown that a freeze-thawing process\nimpaired survival, metabolism, and the ability to adhere to\nendothelial cells. The authors concluded that NMP conditions\naffect MSC but show sufficient support of their function and\nsurvival that MSC administration through NMP should be\nconsidered, and secondly that slight differences in the behavior\nof porcine and human MSC need to be taken into account (158).\nAnother recent analysis focused on the characteristics of\nculture-expanded MSC, investigating heir viability and homin\nduring NMP. Kidneys were perfused for 7 h in the presence\nof 105\n, 106\n, or 107 human adipose tissue-derived MSC. Intact\nMSCs were detected in the lumen of glomerular capillaries,\nbut only in the 107 MSC group. After a rapid decline of cell\nnumbers during NMP, only a small portion of the MSCs were\nintact, and these were clustered in a minority of glomeruli. Apart\nfrom outlining the complexity of MSC therapy during MP, the\nauthors concluded that “an exciting new window of opportunity\nmight emerge to actively pre-condition isolated organs in a fully\ncontrolled setting and in the absence of an immune response, before\nthey are transplanted” (172).\nIt is noteworthy that such promising findings have recently\nled to the creation of the international “MePEP consortium”\n(173) in order to study this novel modality of treatment in\npreparation for human trials. Therefore, more findings on MSC\nand immunomodulation can be expected in the near future.\nAnti-inflammatory Agents\nAlternatively, pharmacologic interventions to decrease\nimmunogenicity or prevent recurrent disease can be applied\nduring MP. The seemingly most obvious strategy to influence the\ninflammatory profile is the delivery of anti-inflammatory agents\ndirectly into the machine perfusion circuit, treating the liver\nex vivo during the preservation period to obviate the need for\nlifelong immunosuppression or to improve long-term outcomes\nseparate from the physiological quality of the organ at the time\nof transplantation (174).\nSeveral targets for potential agents have been identified.\nAmongst these is TNF-alpha, one of the most potent\nproinflammatory cytokines, which is released in response\nto and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of IRI (175, 176).\nTherefore, in a recent clinical HMP study, it was hypothesized\nthat the administration of the TNF-α inhibitor etanercept\ncould improve outcomes following kidney transplantation.\nHowever, no significant differences were found concerning\nkidney machine perfusion parameters, including average flow\nand vascular resistance, nor did the authors observe significant\nchanges regarding DGF, rejection episodes, or allograft survival\n(177). However, it has to be taken in mind that this study was\ncarried out under hypothermic conditions. Although possible in\nother machine-perfusion techniques, NMP seems to be ideal, as\nactive metabolism permits graft intervention and modification\nduring preservation, circumstances that are not present in\nHMP (178).\nMore promising data come from a porcine study in\nwhich a variety of agents were added to act at different\nlevels. Prostaglandin E1, a prostacyclin analog with vasodilator,\nantiplatelet, fibrinolytic, and several other anti-inflammatory\nproperties, was continuously administered. In addition, n\ufffeacetylcysteine was added due to its free radical scavenging\nproperties. Sevoflurane was administered due to its protective\nproperties on endothelial cells, and carbon monoxide was\nadded with the objective of improving vasodilatation and\nreducing inflammation. Indeed, during a 3-day follow-up after\ntransplantation, this treatment resulted in lower AST levels as\nwell as lower levels of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF- α),\nand galactosidase and increased IL-10 levels (179).\nOther candidate markers for modulation during MP are anti\ufffeinflammatory receptors. In this context, the adenosine A2A\nreceptor downregulates inflammation, including the suppression\nof CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and increases endothelial cell\nnitric oxide (174). Since experiences in rabbit experiments\nshowed that adenosine A2A receptor activation can diminish\nIRI (180), a subsequent study evaluated whether treatment with\nan adenosine A2A receptor agonist could be beneficial during\nnormothermic ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP). Indeed, EVLP\nwith targeted A2AR agonist treatment could attenuate IRI after\ntransplantation of DCD donor lungs subjected to prolonged 12-h\ncold preservation in a preclinical porcine model (181).\nAdenoviral Vector Gene Delivery\nAs cellular metabolism is preserved during normothermic\nperfusion, it represents a potential platform for effective gene\ntransduction in a specific graft (182). To test this hypothesis\nin donor lungs, Yeung et al. used a porcine model of\nEVLP and treated them with an E1-, E3-deleted adenoviral\nvector encoding either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or the\nimmunosuppressive interleukin-10 (IL-10). They observed a\ndecreased expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1,\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 14 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nTNF-α, and IL-6, as well as attenuation of the alloimmune\nresponse following transplantation (174, 182).\nThis finding is also of particular interest, since the delivery\nof adenoviral vectors could result in a prompt innate immune\nresponse by macrophages, recruiting circulating neutrophils,\nwhich in turn propagate the inflammatory response. Moreover,\nin the transplant setting, this preexisting inflammation could\npotentiate subsequent IRI (182, 183). Therefore, the authors\ncompared in vivo and ex vivo administration and showed that\ndonor lung is superior to in vivo delivery since it leads to less\nvector-associated inflammation (182).\nConcerning the kidney, already in 2002, proof of principle of\na similar technique had been reported by Brasile et al., using a\nrecombinant adenovirus, Ad5, CMV5 GFP encoded with green\nfluorescence protein. They achieved effective transfection and\nsynthesis during 24 h of ex vivo normothermic perfusion (184).\nOnly recently has a normothermic ex vivo organ perfusion\ndelivery method for cardiac transplantation gene therapy been\nreported. Adenoviral vector transduction was utilized to deliver\nparticles of an Adenoviral firefly luciferase vector with a\ncytomegalovirus (CMV) promotor to porcine donor hearts\nduring NMP and prior to heterotopic implantation. Along with\na high copy number of vector genomic DNA in transplanted\nhearts, there was no evidence of vector DNA in either the\nrecipient’s native heart or liver, substantiating the applicability\nand safety of the protocol.\nThese findings make it likely that this technology could be\nfeasible for other organ systems as well. A wide variety of\ninteresting genes could be targeted. As has been reviewed lately\n(159), promising possibilities arise when translating the findings\nof rodent models using adenoviruses expressing CTLA4Ig (185)\nto the setting of NMP; also, NMP could be used to deliver\ngene therapies that induce cytoprotection against IRI, such as\nmyr-Akt (159, 186).\nOutstandingly, Figueiredo et al. recently showed that antigen\nsilencing is feasible during NMP. In a porcine model of\nlung NMP, short hairpin RNAs were delivered by lentiviral\nvectors, successfully reducing the immunogenicity of the\nlung by silencing MHC expression on the endothelium.\nThe authors concluded that the decrease in immunogenicity\ncarries the potential to generate immunologically invisible\norgans to counteract the burden of rejection and\nimmunosuppression (187).\nOrgan Reconditioning and Repair\nRecent experimental data primarily focusing on marginal livers\nfurthermore suggested that NMP offers a platform for organ\nreconditioning and repair.\nImpressive data from Birmingham, UK, showed that livers\ndiscarded due to pronounced steatosis could be effectively treated\nwith defatting agents during 6 h of NMP. Tissue triglycerides\nwere lowered by 38% and macrovesicular steatosis by 40%, which\nwas associated with a down-regulation of inflammatory marker\nexpression relevant for oxidative injury and activation of immune\ncells (CD14; CD11b), combined with reduced inflammatory\ncytokines in the perfusate (TNFα, IL-1β) (188). In addition,\narterial vasospasm can be modulated by the application of ET-1\nantagonists, prostacyclin analog, or calcium channel antagonists\nduring NMP (189). Furthermore, NMP can be used for the\ndirect and efficient application of antiviral agents, as shown in\na porcine NMP model, in which Miravirsen, an inhibitor of\nhepatitis C virus (HCV) replication, produced improved uptake\ncompared to SCS control livers. The authors concluded that\nthis approach might offer a future strategy to prevent HCV\nreinfection after liver transplantation (190). Likewise, HCV\ufffeinfected human donor lungs could effectively be treated during\nshort-time EVLP via physical viral clearance combined with\ngermicidal light-based therapies (191).\nIn summary, immunomodulation in the context of MP seems\nto offer a plethora of novel strategies. A series of porcine\nand human studies distinctively underline its effectiveness and\nfeasibility. However, as formulated in a recent review (191, 192),\nthe studies conducted so far just scratch the surface of conceivable\ninterventions. In particular, NMP provides an ideal platform\nfor immunomodulatory modifications. The next step will be the\ntranslation of findings from preclinical and rodent models as well\nas HMP trials into the setting of NMP.\nTHE IMMEDIATE FUTURE IN THE\nTRANSPLANTATION OF MARGINAL\nORGANS\nMuch speculation about the changes in transplantation is\ncurrently energizing the field. The conceptual approach of\nextracorporal organ preservation and monitoring begs for\nspeculation about organ reconditioning, repair, and treatment.\nWhile these are all valid considerations and perfectly reasonable\nhopes, the implementation of machine perfusion is the first\nstep. Immediate and widespread adoption of HMP and NMP is\nunlikely since this technology does not immediately improve the\noutcome with regard to the primary endpoints in transplantation:\npatient and graft survival. Authority approval and market entry\nare largely based on secondary endpoints such as delayed\ngraft function (DGF, kidney) or primary poor function (PPF,\nliver), which are considered to serve as surrogates for improved\nlong-term results. The conceptual limitation with surrogates is,\nhowever, that the predictive value is not uniformly robust or\nformally established and immediately reproducible. The DGF\nrate, for example, in kidneys from DCD donors is high, but\nthe predictive value of DFG in these cases is low (193). The\ndefinition of PPF is mostly based on high AST/ALT values early\nafter transplantation. While these parameters indicate hepatocyte\ndamage, correlation with the eventual outcome is very limited\n(194). Hence, the adoption of the technology is possibly built\non the wish for innovation and the belief in the value of the\ntime gain with NMP. Preliminary data on HOPE in recent and\nongoing trials indicate a possible benefit in organ survival. If such\nan outcome is eventually formally achieved, the arguments for\nimplementation will be more substantial.\nFor clinical implementation, several regional and center\nfactors play an important role. First, the retrieval team\nmay be different from the team eventually performing the\ntransplantation. Even if the retrieval team is familiar with the\ntechnology, the preparation of the graft prior to NMP (more\nthan HMP) is more substantial and more definitive for the\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 15 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nfate of the graft. Hence, in a system with longer-distance organ\nexchange, additional steps and a new routine would need to be\nestablished. The technology and the shifting of the work of the\nbacktable procedure to the retrieving team need to be considered.\nThe alternative approach where the organ is transferred to\nthe recipient center and is then machine perfused is currently\nbeing pursued, but data indicating the actual advantage of this\napproach are lacking (195). For now, NMP serves as a technology\nthat allows one important asset in surgery to be gained: time.\nThe value of time and flexibility is dependent on the regional\ncircumstances but may hold great potential for easing the surgery\nlogistics, working hours, and surgical training but also gives rise\nto higher risks of nighttime procedures. The actual value of time\nin this context, however, requires further attention and needs to\nbe better defined.\nThe consideration of longer-term organ preservation under\nnormothermic conditions further carries the challenge of\ndefining the responsibilities for managing and monitoring the\norgans. Eventually, the working place description of health\ncare workers involved in this will require adoption and formal\ntraining. Standard operating procedures (SOP) and safety\nparameters need to be established for a wider spread use of\nthe technology. It is likely that the advanced technological\nrequirements and the need for 24-h availability of knowhow and\npersonnel would favor the establishment of regional hubs for MP.\nDespite the hype in the field, the clinical adoption of MP is\nslow. In addition to the above-mentioned factors, the lack of\nreimbursement is a stringent limitation in many regions. For the\ntechnology to be reimbursed, the authorities will require hard\nfacts. Hence, the path to more widespread clinical use might\nbe long, and the focus should remain on the demonstration of\nsuperiority regarding the most relevant clinical endpoints.\nOne major important step toward collective advancement in\nthis field would be the definition of data points during and\nafter MP and the establishment of registries for coordinated\ndata collection. Such data points should include the definition\nand terminology of the various time points and actions such as\ncold flush and storage prior to MP, temperature and flow during\nMP, parameters indicating metabolic function and bile/urine\nproduction during MP, second flush, second cold ischemia time,\nand others. One of the hurdles in improving NMP is the\nlarge number of variables added to preservation. Identifying\nthe relevance of individual parameters will require attention\nto the details of the procedure and adequate data collection\nand handling. To the knowledge of the authors, no routine\ndata collection and no consensus toward data points have been\nestablished at present.\nThe decision-making process in MP is relatively arbitrary\nsince the data collected during MP are suggestive but not formally\nestablished as quality-defining parameters. Since the decision to\ntransplant an organ or not is extremely meaningful, great care\nneeds to be applied in the process, and detailed documentation\nof the reasoning for decision making should be carried out. A\ngreater effort toward orchestrated data collection could help to\nstreamline and eventually enhance the robustness of the decision\ufffemaking process.\nThe preference for MP to be used for the preservation\nof marginal organs results from the greater need for\norgan assessment and the greater potential benefit of better\npreservation. This might be particularly true and relevant for\norgans from uncontrolled DCDs, where the circumstances and\nthe accumulated damage to the organs might be less clear. The\nvalue of an additional assessment under these conditions is not\nonly meaningful with respect to the number of additional organs\nfor transplantation but also for preventing the transplantation\nof organs that are severely damaged. While the assessment\nof this subject would be highly valuable and is much needed,\nthe behavior of the investigators in the NMP trial by Nasralla\net al. indicates the limitations and conflicts observed with this\napproach (62). Since the trial cannot be fully blinded, the bias\ngenerated by the fact that a technology is used that is deemed\nsuperior and the data generated during MP define a deviation in\nthe behavior of the decision makers.\nTHE FAR FUTURE OF (MARGINAL) ORGAN\nTRANSPLANTATION\nThe fantasies building on the realization of extracorporal organ\npreservation under physiological conditions are currently\nfuelling hopes that this technology could facilitate tissue\nregeneration, organ repair, immunomodulation, xenograft\nhumanification, and many other things. MP as a platform\nmay impact medicine far beyond transplantation and delivers\na unique chance to alter the treatment of organ failure and\norgan disease. Between the imagination and the realization\nof medical advancement stands a mountain of work and an\nas yet unknown but probably large number of technical and\nmethodological challenges. An important initial goal is the\nexpansion of the duration of MP and the establishment of\nan equilibrium of the condition of the organ. Preservation\nof organs for several days will likely require additional\nmodifications from the currently existing technologies.\nPreservation of the acid-base equilibrium, nutrition organ\nweight-induced pressure, electrolyte shift, hemolysis, and many\nother challenges may require closer attention. A tissue- and/or\ncell-specific and targeted treatment is a realistic consideration,\nand proof of concept trials indicate the feasibility of this\napproach (196, 197). The treatment and replacement of\ndamaged or displaced elements of organs may evolve as a\nnew discipline and help the field to make the leap to serve\none of the greatest unmet needs: The effective treatment of\ndamaged organs.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nTR and SS conceived and designed the study and wrote the\nmanuscript.

What are the current research/knowledge gaps in standardizing perfusion protocols?,"[""R EVI EW Open Access\nHydroxyethyl starch for perioperative goal\ufffedirected fluid therapy in 2020: a narrative\nreview\nAlexandre Joosten1,2,3* , Sean Coeckelenbergh1\n, Brenton Alexander4\n, Amélie Delaporte5\n, Maxime Cannesson6\n,\nJacques Duranteau2\n, Bernd Saugel7,8, Jean-Louis Vincent9 and Philippe Van der Linden10\nAbstract\nBackground: Perioperative fluid management – including the type, dose, and timing of administration –directly\naffects patient outcome after major surgery. The objective of fluid administration is to optimize intravascular fluid\nstatus to maintain adequate tissue perfusion. There is continuing controversy around the perioperative use of\ncrystalloid versus colloid fluids. Unfortunately, the importance of fluid volume, which significantly influences the\nbenefit-to-risk ratio of each chosen solution, has often been overlooked in this debate.\nMain text: The volume of fluid administered during the perioperative period can influence the incidence and\nseverity of postoperative complications. Regrettably, there is still huge variability in fluid administration practices,\nboth intra-and inter-individual, among clinicians. Goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT), aimed at optimizing flow\uffferelated variables, has been demonstrated to have some clinical benefit and has been recommended by multiple\nprofessional societies. However, this approach has failed to achieve widespread adoption. A closed-loop fluid\nadministration system designed to assist anesthesia providers in consistently applying GDFT strategies has recently\nbeen developed and tested. Such an approach may change the crystalloid versus colloid debate. Because colloid\nsolutions have a more profound effect on intravascular volume and longer plasma persistence, their use in this\nmore “controlled” context could be associated with a lower fluid balance, and potentially improved patient\noutcome. Additionally, most studies that have assessed the impact of a GDFT strategy on the outcome of high-risk\nsurgical patients have used hydroxyethyl starch (HES) solutions in their protocols. Some of these studies have\ndemonstrated beneficial effects, while none of them has reported severe complications.\n(Continued on next page)\n© The Author(s). 2020 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License,\nwhich permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give\nappropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if\nchanges were made.

The amount of fluid given should be guided\nby well-defined physiologic targets. Compliance with a predefined hemodynamic protocol may be optimized by\nusing a computerized system. The type of fluid should also be individualized, as should any drug therapy, with\ncareful consideration of timing and dose. It is our perspective that HES solutions remain a valid option for fluid\ntherapy in the perioperative context because of their effects on blood volume and their reasonable benefit/risk\nprofile.\nKeywords: Colloid, Balanced crystalloids, Fluid responsiveness, Hemodynamic monitoring, Acute renal failure, Outcome\nBackground\nPerioperative fluid therapy is a routine aspect of daily\nclinical practice for most anesthesiologists but remains a\ntherapeutic challenge. One of the most complex aspects\nof perioperative fluid therapy is determining how much\nfluid to give each patient. Numerous observational studies\nhave reported a strong association between both excessive\nand insufficient perioperative fluid administration and an\nincreased risk of postoperative complications [1–6]. As it is\ndifficult to predict or anticipate the volume of fluids a pa\ufffetient will need during surgery, several national and inter\ufffenational societies recommend using goal-directed fluid\ntherapy (GDFT) based on advanced hemodynamic moni\ufffetoring in patients undergoing high-risk surgery [7–10].\nGDFT has been promoted as helping to standardize fluid\nadministration using recommended and validated proto\ufffecols, thereby improving patient outcomes and decreasing\ncosts [11–13]. Despite an abundance of literature on this\ntopic, the volume of fluid that should be administered to\nachieve and maintain normovolemia is still the subject\nintense controversy.\nThe choice of intravenous fluid type has also been a\nsubject of passionate debate, recently refueled by the\npublication of several large, prospective, randomized\nstudies in different patient populations. These studies\nhave demonstrated the impact of intravenous fluid solu\ufffetions on patient outcomes, particularly in critically ill pa\ufffetients in the intensive care setting [14]. Although their\nresults have created intense controversy, these studies\nhave clearly demonstrated that the need for intravenous\ninfusions may vary considerably in a given patient during\nthe course of his/her clinical course [15]. They have also\nindicated that results observed in critically ill patients can\ufffenot be extrapolated to surgical patients. The R.O.S.E. con\ufffeceptual model (Resuscitation, Optimization, Stabilization,\nEvacuation) condenses precisely a dynamic approach of\nfluid therapy allowing to maximize its benefits while redu\ufffecing its harms [16]. Importantly, surgical patients receiv\ufffeing i.v fluids in the perioperative setting are typically in\nthe “Optimization phase” and this specific category of pa\ufffetients will be discussed in the present review. Therefore,\nthe goal of this narrative review article is to discuss the\nfundamentals of perioperative fluid therapy through four\nfrequently asked questions regarding perioperative fluid\ntherapy.\nMain text\nQuestion 1: should we administer fluids in a goal-directed\nfashion?\nYES.\nThere is quite strong evidence to support the benefits\nof GDFT in high-risk patients undergoing major surgical\nprocedures [9, 11]. Indeed, over the past 15 years, several\nmeta-analyses of the impact of GDFT in patients under\ufffegoing moderate and high-risk surgeries have observed\nthat GDFT improves outcome compared with routine\ncare [8, 11, 17–20]. However, the studies included in\nthese meta-analyses are highly heterogeneous, with dif\ufffeferent protocols, different physiologic endpoints, and\ndifferent technologies to measure stroke volume and\ncardiac output. Interestingly, these studies demonstrate\nthat patients in the GDFT groups also received highly\nvariable volumes of fluids. While clinical pathways and\nprotocols are not designed to eliminate all forms of vari\ufffeability, differences in individual care should be patient\ndriven and not practitioner dependent. Adequate GDFT\nfor patients undergoing major surgery requires that\nstroke volume or cardiac output are monitored to assess\nfluid responsiveness and that an algorithm is designed\nthat will be applied by all members of the anesthesia\nteam. Admittedly, some studies have not demonstrated a\nbeneficial effect of GDFT on patient outcome [21–25].\nHowever, these studies were mainly underpowered and/\nor conducted in relatively healthy patients with minimal\nfluid shift and blood loss [23, 24, 26–28]. Additionally,\ncompliance to the study protocols must be examined\nclosely when evaluating the results [29]. Pearse et al.\nnicely demonstrated that when a GDFT protocol is con\ufffesistently applied, the treatment effect is strengthened\n[25]. Indeed, according to the authors of this study, “In\nthe prespecified adherence-adjusted analysis conducted\nusing established methods, the observed treatment effect\nwas strengthened when the 65 patients whose care was\nnon adherent were assumed to experience the same\nJoosten et al. BMC Anesthesiology (2020) 20:209 Page 2 of 9\n\noutcome as if they had been allocated to the alternative\ngroup (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.61–0.99; P = 0.04)”. Another\npoint of interest is that use of a GDFT protocol has\nnever been associated with a deleterious effect for the\npatient. It is therefore not surprising that GDFT has\nbeen included in the national expert recommendations\nof several countries, including the United Kingdom and\nFrance [7, 10]. Obviously, some questions related to\nGDFT remain unanswered. What is the ideal endpoint?\nWhat is the best monitor to use when applying GDFT?\nWhat should be the ideal maintenance crystalloid infu\ufffesion rate? What is the ideal “type” of fluid (crystalloid\nalone or a combination of crystalloid and colloid)? What\nis the ideal target patient population? Should GDFT pro\ufffetocols include inotropic support?\nMost institutions and anesthesiology departments have\nwritten protocols and standardized pathways for man\ufffeagement of severe perioperative bleeding, although “level\n1A” evidence is mostly absent [30, 31]. Application of\nthese protocols has demonstrated reduced variability in\ntreatment and improved quality of care [32]. In our\nopinion, the same approach should be applied to\nhemodynamic and fluid management. In accordance\nwith international guidelines, institutions should be en\ufffecouraged to establish a written GDFT protocol. These\nGDFT strategies can rely on pulse pressure variation\nalone, enabling use in the absence of a cardiac output\nmonitor and in clinical settings where more advanced\nmonitoring is not available. As a result, implementing\nGDFT should not be associated with a large increase in\ncosts.\nQuestion 2: is it possible to improve current GDFT?\nYES.\nDespite the development of minimally invasive moni\ufffetoring devices and the simplification of GDFT protocols\nover the last decade [33, 34], clinicians’ compliance with\nthe application of these protocols remains poor, ranging\nbetween 62 and 87%, even in ideal study conditions\n[9, 35]. Adherence of less than 50% to protocols is re\ufffeported in daily practice across different medical spe\ufffecialties, but at least 80% adherence is required to\nobserve improved clinical outcomes [36–38]. Effective\nmanagement and application of GDFT algorithms\noften requires careful monitoring with frequent and\nrepeated interventions by the clinician [34]. This can\nbe particularly difficult for anesthesiologists who work\nin a stressful environment and are subject to numer\ufffeous stimuli and distractions, all of which can decrease\ntheir attention and concentration.\nIn a recent prospective feasibility study, Menger et al.\npaired a second anesthesiologist, who was specifically\ndedicated to applying the written GDFT protocol, with\nthe primary anesthesiologist in charge of the patient.\nWith this “active clinical decision support system”, the\nauthors observed a protocol compliance of about 85%\n[39]. Unfortunately, such an approach is very costly in\nterms of human resources, which limits its implementa\ufffetion [40]. Over the past decade, members of our team\nhave developed a closed-loop administration system\nbased on the simultaneous analysis of multiple advanced\nhemodynamic indices provided by a minimally-invasive\nhemodynamic monitoring device and controlled by a\ncomputer [27, 41–43] (Fig. 1). With this system, the ad\ufffeministration of multiple fluid boluses is completely auto\ufffemated, requiring only minimal human intervention. We\nhave demonstrated that implementation of this “com\ufffeputer system” resulted in less intraoperative time spent\nin a preload-dependent state (stroke volume variation >\n13%) compared to a manually applied protocol, using\nboth minimally invasive and noninvasive technologies\n[43, 44]. Implementation of these systems at the patient’s\nbedside has also been associated with better patient out\ufffecomes compared to routine care [45]. The software for\nthis technology has now been implemented into the\nEV1000 monitoring device as a real-time clinical deci\ufffesion support system and is widely available for clinical\nuse [46]. Of note, after the initial development of our\nclosed-loop system for GDFT administration, our atten\ufffetion has now shifted to automated system allowing tight\nvasopressor infusion in order to be able to design a fully\nautomated system for perioperative goal directed\nhemodynamic therapy, allowing the co-titration of fluid\nand vasopressors [47–52].\nQuestion 3: is there a place for a colloid solution in GDFT\nprotocols?\nYES.\nFrom a physiological perspective, it seems obvious that\ncolloid solutions have a role in GDFT protocols [53].\nColloid solutions remain longer intravascularly than do\ncrystalloid solutions, continuing to create oncotic pres\ufffesure, so theoretically they are associated with a decrease\nin the amount of fluid needed to achieve and maintain\nhemodynamic goals [54–57]. The exclusive use of crys\ufffetalloid solutions, because of their lower volume effect\nand shorter intravascular persistence, is associated with\ngreater volumes of fluid administration resulting in fluid\noverload and its potential complications in the peri\ufffeoperative period [57]. Indeed, compared to colloid solu\ufffetions, greater crystalloid fluid volumes may be required\nto restore intravascular volume [58]. In an experimental\nstudy, Hiltebrand et al. showed that compared to a crys\ufffetalloid solution (Ringer’s lactate), administration of HES\nboluses, guided by the measurement of venous oxygen\nsaturation, reduced the total volume of fluid infused\nand, more importantly, improved microcirculatory blood\nflow and intestinal oxygen partial pressure after\nJoosten et al. BMC Anesthesiology (2020) 20:209 Page 3 of 9\n\nabdominal surgery [59]. Excessive fluid administration\n(mainly crystalloids) has been shown to increase the risk\nof intestinal tissue edema, leading not only to delayed re\ufffesumption of intestinal activity and anastomotic leakage,\nbut also to a risk of pulmonary edema and postoperative\nrespiratory complications, all of which increase the hos\ufffepital length of stay [6, 60]. The use of large volumes of\nisotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) also leads to an increased\nrisk of hyperchloremic acidosis, which can lead to\ngastrointestinal and renal dysfunction, secondary to the\nvasoconstrictive properties of the chloride ion [61]. Im\ufffeportantly, volume effects of colloids have been demon\ufffestrated to be context sensitive [62]. Administration of\niso-oncotic colloids (5% albumin or 6% hydroxyethyl\nstarch) during acute bleeding when carefully maintaining\nintravascular normovolemia led to volume effects of\nmore than 90% [63, 64]. In contrast, preoperative vol\ufffeume loading in a non-bleeding patient resulted in a vol\ufffeume effect of only 30–35%, two-third of the given bolus\nleaving the vascular space toward the interstitial com\ufffepartment within minutes [65]. Colloids and crystalloids\ncannot be exchanged by simply adapting the amount\n[66]. Recently, Orbegozo Cortes et al. reviewed all stud\ufffeies comparing crystalloid and colloid solutions in all\ntypes of patients (medical, surgical, and trauma patients),\nmany of which likely had altered vascular permeability\n[54]. They reported that greater volumes were required\nto achieve similar targets with crystalloid than with\ncolloid solutions (estimated ratio: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.36–\n1.65). Figure 2 represents the comparison of the\ncrystalloids vs colloids ratio extracted from the study\nfrom Orbegozo et al. in the context of an administra\ufffetion of crystalloids without or with a certain amount\nof colloids [54]. These results were confirmed by\nAnnane et al. in the CRISTAL study [67]. Although\nthis ratio would be expected to be greater than 1.5, it\nis important to note that none of these studies strictly\ncompared a pure colloid with a pure crystalloid strat\ufffeegy as the colloid groups also always received some\ncrystalloid infusion.\nIn the context of perioperative GDFT, there are very\nfew clinical data evaluating the influence of the type of\nintravenous fluid used on outcome. Not surprisingly,\nthere are currently no recommendations as to the type\nof fluid (crystalloids or colloids) that should be used to\noptimize a patient’s intravascular blood volume in the\nperioperative setting. It is interesting to note that 85% of\nthe GDFT studies published in the literature used a col\ufffeloid solution to optimize the patient’s stroke volume and\ncardiac output [53]. Most of these studies demonstrated\na benefit in favor of the GDFT group versus the control\ngroup, which should encourage our academic commu\ufffenity to continue examining the potential benefits of\ncolloid use moving forward.\nFig. 1 Closed-loop fluid management set-up. The closed-loop was connected with the EV1000 monitoring device with an analog-to-digital\nadapter connected to the EV1000 analog output device. The closed-loop software was run on a Shuttle X50 touchscreen PC. A Q-core Sapphire\nMulti-Therapy Infusion Pump (Q-Core, Netanya, Israel) was used to deliver mini fluid challenges of 100 ml and was linked to the closed-loop\nthrough a serial connection\nJoosten et al. BMC Anesthesiology (2020) 20:209 Page 4 of 9\n\nQuestion 4: is there a place for hydroxyethyl starch\nsolutions?\nYES.\nAlbumin is the most frequently used colloid solution\nand is considered to be the colloid solution of choice.\nThe main limitations to its use are cost and availability,\nwhich have led to the development of synthetic colloid\nsolutions as alternatives. Among synthetic colloid,\nstarches are by far the most studied solutions.\nHES solutions are plant-based (corn or potato) colloid\nsolutions derived from the enzymatic hydrolysis of\nstarch. Their properties are defined by molecular weight,\ndegree of substitution, C2/C6 ratio and concentration.\nThey are available as either 0.9% saline or balanced crys\ufffetalloid solutions. The most recent (third) generation of\nHES solutions has a lower molecular weight, which\nmaintains oncotic effects while simultaneously decreas\ufffeing adverse events (i.e., hemostatic alterations, renal fail\ufffeure, and pruritus). The maximum daily recommended\ndose is 30 ml/kg.\nThere is considerable controversy regarding the bene\ufffefits and risks associated with the use of HES solutions.\nThis controversy has stemmed from large multicenter\nstudies in critically ill patients, and more specifically sep\ufffetic patients, which have reported adverse effects of HES\nsolutions on mortality and/or renal function [68–70].\nThese studies have prompted the European Medicine\nAgency to restrict its use in the perioperative context.\nSeveral meta-analyses showed no association between\nHES administration and worse outcome in surgical pa\ufffetients [71, 72], so these concerns likely do not apply to\nshort term intraoperative fluid expansion. Additionally,\nmost studies that have demonstrated a benefit of GDFT\nover standard of care in high-risk surgical patients have\nused HES solutions to optimize stroke volume or cardiac\noutput [53].\nOne small single-center, single-blinded randomized\ntrial compared 5% albumin solution to 6% HES 130/0.4\nsolution used as part of a GDFT protocol in patients\nundergoing elective cystectomy [73]. There was no sig\ufffenificant difference between the two groups with respect\nto the primary outcome, i.e., kidney function and kidney\ninjury assessed up to postoperative day 90. Of note, the\nincidence of pruritus, evaluated by a questionnaire, was\nsignificantly higher in the albumin group.\nFour double-blinded randomized studies have assessed\nthe impact on patient outcome of HES 130/0.4 solution\nversus a crystalloid solution while standardizing the vol\ufffeume and timing of administration using a GDFT proto\ufffecol [56, 57, 74, 75]. Yates et al. reported no benefit of\nHES solution over Ringer’s lactate (Hartmann) solution\nin terms of postoperative complications in 202 patients\nundergoing colorectal surgery [56]. However, in this\nmonocenter study, 38% of patients in the crystalloid\ngroup received a rescue colloid solution (a gelatin) com\ufffepared to 12% in the HES group. Interpretation of the re\ufffesults is thus challenging as this study actually compared\ntwo groups that received a combination of crystalloid\nand colloid solutions in different proportions. We ob\ufffeserved that a HES-based GDFT was associated with a\nlower incidence of postoperative complications than a\nbalanced crystalloid GDFT in 160 patients undergoing\nmajor abdominal surgery [57]. In a multicenter study\n(N = 1057), Kabon et al. reported that Doppler-guided\nintraoperative HES administration did not reduce a\ncomposite outcome of serious postoperative cardiac, pul\ufffemonary, infectious, gastrointestinal, renal and coagula\ufffetion complications compared to lactated Ringer’s\nFig. 2 Comparison of the fluid requirements necessary for the optimization of the patient. The question is not to compare the administration of\ncolloids versus crystalloids, but to compare crystalloids without or with a certain amount of colloids\nJoosten et al. BMC Anesthesiology (2020) 20:209 Page 5 of 9\n\nsolution in patients undergoing moderate-to-high risk\nabdominal surgery [74]. In another multicenter study of\n775 patients at increased risk of postoperative kidney in\ufffejury after major abdominal surgery, Futier et al. reported\nthat HES solution used according to a stroke volume\ufffeguided hemodynamic therapy algorithm did not reduce\na composite outcome of death or major postoperative\ncomplications compared to isotonic saline [75]. How\ufffeever, more patients in the HES group developed mild\nacute kidney injury (P = .03) in the immediate postopera\ufffetive period. In contrast, we did not observe any deleteri\ufffeous effect of HES solution on long-term (1 year) kidney\nfunction compared to a balanced crystalloid solution in\nour study population [76].\nNot surprisingly, these four studies confirm what physi\ufffeology tells us: to achieve a predefined hemodynamic\ntarget, a smaller volume of colloid solution, namely HES\n130/0.4, is required, compared to crystalloid solution,\nresulting in a less positive intraoperative fluid balance. Of\nnote, several studies have reported an association between\npositive perioperative fluid balance and worse outcome\n[77–80]. However, among the four studies cited above,\nour study reported a reduced incidence of postoperative\ncomplications with the use of HES solution, associated\nwith a lower intraoperative fluid balance [57]. Interest\ufffeingly, the major difference between our study and the\nthree others is the protocol used to guide fluid administra\ufffetion. While the three other studies [68, 69, 71] used a\npragmatic approach in which fluid boluses (250 ml fluid\nchallenges) were administered manually by the clinician in\ncharge of the patient in order to maximize stroke volume,\nwe used a closed-loop delivery system in which small bo\ufffeluses (100 ml mini-fluid challenges) were administered\nautomatically by a computer-controlled infusion pump\nwith dedicated software that optimized stroke volume\n[70]. This system allowed strict standardization of fluid\nadministration, increasing compliance with the protocol\nand improving the accuracy of implementation. The prag\ufffematic approach used in the other studies, which reflects\nroutine clinical practice, is inherently associated with\nlower protocol adherence and a high potential risk of\nprotocol violations. When comparing our study to the\nstudy by Futier et al., the different strategies resulted in\nmore “liberal” fluid administration in the Futier et al. study\nand a more “restrictive” approach in ours. However, the\namount of HES solution infused in the colloid groups of\nthe two studies was approximately the same (±1000 ml),\nwhereas the total volume of crystalloid solution was much\nhigher in the study by Futier et al. Consequently, cumula\ufffetive net fluid balance on day one was also much more\npositive in this latter study (Fig. 3), which might explain\nthe difference in the results reported in these two studies.\nIn accordance with this hypothesis, fluid volume rather\nthan fluid type may be responsible for the divergent\nresults seen across the four studies. Importantly, the\nstudy of Joosten et al. [57] included the smaller num\ufffeber of patients compared to the three other ones [56,\n74, 75]; their results need to be therefore confirmed.\nTwo large randomized controlled trials (TETHYS trial\n[N = 350] in trauma patients and PHOENICS trial\n[N = 2280] in elective abdominal surgical patients) are\non the way. They should clearly help to precise the\nbenefit to risk ratio associated with the use of HES in\nthe two specific contexts. In the final debate, the\nprice should be taken into account as HES solutions\nare much more expensive than crystalloid solutions,\nbut significantly cheaper than albumin solutions in\nmost European countries.\nFig. 3 Comparison of fluid balance at postoperative day 1 (POD1) between the study of Futier et al vs Joosten et al\nJoosten et al. BMC Anesthesiology (2020) 20:209 Page 6 of 9\n\nConclusion\nIn the perioperative setting, not only the type of fluid\nbut also the volume administered can impact a patient’s\noutcome following major surgery. Fluid volume should\nbe guided by predefined physiologic targets, using an in\ufffedividualized hemodynamic algorithm. Clinician compli\ufffeance with such protocols can be improved by using\nautomated closed-loop systems that enable automation\nof some of the simple but restrictive therapeutic tasks. It\nis of prime importance that intravenous fluids be admin\ufffeistered with the same care as any other drug, with strict\nindications and contraindications and precautions with\nregard to potential adverse effects. Finally, perioperative\ncolloid solutions, and in particular HES solutions, may\nhave a place in optimizing a patient’s hemodynamic sta\ufffetus while limiting the total volume of fluid administered.\nLarge multicenter studies that assess the impact of crys\ufffetalloids vs colloids and that apply a strict approach that\nensures high protocol compliance, for example with a\nclosed-loop system, are needed.\nAbbreviations\nGDFT: Goal directed fluid therapy; HES: Hydroxyethyl starch\nAcknowledgements\nNA\nAuthors’ contributions\nA.J.: Manuscript draft and approval of manuscript.

The authors argue that the current focus on crystalloid solutions may lead to excessive fluid administration, resulting in fluid overload and its potential complications. They suggest that colloid solutions, due to their longer intravascular persistence, may have a role in goal-directed fluid therapy protocols. The authors highlight the need for improved compliance with guideline-based fluid management strategies, which can be achieved through the use of automated systems. The article provides references to various studies supporting the use of colloid solutions in goal-directed fluid therapy protocols. Overall, the article emphasizes the importance of considering the volume effect of different fluid solutions in perioperative fluid management strategies.",1.0,0.8118055016975326,FULL_PAPER
What are the current research/knowledge gaps in standardizing perfusion protocols?,"['Review Article\nNormothermic Ex-vivo Liver Perfusion and the Clinical\nImplications for Liver Transplantation\nClifford Akateh*1\n, Eliza W. Beal1\n, Bryan A. Whitson2 and Sylvester M. Black3\n1\nGeneral and Gastrointestinal Surgery, Department of Surgery, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center,\nColumbus, Ohio, USA; 2\nDivision of Cardiac Surgery, Department of Surgery, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center,\nColumbus, Ohio, USA; 3\nDivision of Transplant Surgery, Department of Surgery, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center,\nColumbus, Ohio, USA\nAbstract\nDespite significant improvements in outcomes after liver trans\ufffeplantation, many patients continue to die on the waiting list,\nwhile awaiting an available organ for transplantation. Organ\nshortage is not only due to an inadequate number of available\norgans, but also the inability to adequately assess and evaluate\nthese organs prior to transplantation. Over the last few\ndecades, ex-vivo perfusion of the liver has emerged as a\nuseful technique for both improved organ preservation and\nassessment of organs prior to transplantation. Large animal\nstudies have shown the superiority of ex-vivo perfusion over\ncold static storage. However, these studies have not, necessa\uffferily, been translatable to human livers. Small animal studies\nhave been essential in understanding and improving this tech\ufffenology. Similarly, these results have yet to be translated into\nclinical use. A few Phase 1 clinical trials have shown promise\nand confirmed the viability of this technology. However, more\nrobust studies are needed before ex-vivo liver perfusion can be\nwidely accepted as the new clinical standard of organ preser\ufffevation. Here, we aimed to review all relevant large and small\nanimal research, as well as human liver studies on normother\ufffemic ex-vivo perfusion, and to identify areas of deficiency and\nopportunities for future research endeavors.\nCitation of this article: Akateh C, Beal EW, Whitson BA, Black\nSM.

In the United States, in 2016, there\nwere 14,432 patients listed for liver transplantation and 7,841\nliver transplants preformed, leaving 6,591 patients without\navailable organs for transplantation.1 Unfortunately, the\nnumber of deceased organ donors appears to have reached\na plateau.1–4 As such, over the past three decades, many\ncenters have pursued several different methods to increase\nthe available donor pool for transplantation.\nOne such area involves increasing the use of marginal\ndonor organs. While most donor organs can generally tolerate\nvariable durations of static cold storage (SCS), and its asso\ufffeciated ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), marginal organs have\nbeen known to do poorly under such circumstances.5–7 This\nhas led to renewed interest in techniques that would improve\nthe quality of donor organ preservation and, thus, improve the\nsuitability of marginal donor organs for transplantation. The\nconcept of machine perfusion was introduced by Alexis Carrel\nand Charles Lindberg in 1935, in their work “The Culture of\nOrgans”,\n8 and later expanded upon by Belzer,9 who also was\na pioneer in hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP).\nHypothermic ex-vivo perfusion of the kidney produced\nimpressive results and resulted in increases in the number\nof organs available for transplantation. Similar advances\nhave not translated to liver transplantation, however, where\nSCS remains the prominent preservation modality outside of\nclinical trials. Unlike kidneys, livers have a much higher met\ufffeabolic activity and tolerate prolonged ischemia poorly. With\ntheir high metabolic demand, donor livers have been more\nchallenging to perfuse and sustain under normothermic con\ufffeditions. Research into normothermic ex-vivo perfusion has\ncontinued over the last five decades. With advancements in\nthe perfusion technology and the understanding of organ\nphysiology, it has seen renewed interest as a platform to pre\ufffeserve, assess and potentially repair marginal donor organs.10\nThere are a number of devices currently in clinical use for\nthis procedure, including the Organ Assist’s Liver Assist (with\nan adjustable temperature range from 108\n–388 C; for per\ufffeformance of hypothermic and normothermic perfusion),11 the\nOrganOx Metra (normothermic perfusion)12 and the Trans\ufffemedics OCSTM Liver Portable Perfusion System (normother\ufffemic perfusion).13 Overall, these systems consist of a hepatic\nartery +/− portal vein pump, a perfusate reservoir and an\noxygenating chamber of oxygenated perfusion (Fig. 1).\nAlthough there is ongoing debate over the best preserva\ufffetion/perfusion temperature, normothermic (liver) machine\nperfusion (NMP or normothermic machine liver perfusion)\nappears to be gaining more traction and acceptance, compared\nto subnormothermic perfusion and hypothermic machine\nperfusion (HMP). It is, thus, likely to become the standard of\nex-vivo machine perfusion. Regardless of approach, it has\n276 Journal of Clinical and Translational Hepatology 2018 vol. 6 | 276–282\nCopyright: © 2018 Authors.

We sought to\nreview the progress made in NMP, as well as to explore oppor\ufffetunities for future research.\nPre-clinical studies\nLarge animal ex-vivo liver perfusion studies\nEarly in the history of liver transplantation, the impact of graft\nischemia on outcomes had become evident. In a first attempt at\nmachine perfusion of the liver, Slapak et al.14 adapted the\nDebakey roller pump used in cardiac surgery into an apparatus\nfor in-situ liver perfusion of the donor organ for transplantation.\nThese initial perfusions lasted for about 8 h, and were done\nunder hypothermic conditions, given the success of hypothermic\nmachine perfusion of the kidney.14,15 The development of the\nUniversity of Wisconsin (UW) solution and its success in organ\nSCS, led to temporary abandonment of machine perfusion.\nDespite the successes of the UW solution in cold storage,\nhowever, there was growing concern that SCS was not the\nideal preservation method for liver grafts. Although, normo\ufffethermic (regional) perfusion had been introduced by Otto\net al.16 in 1958, and later by Liem et al.17 as a treatment\nalternative for acute liver failure, normothermic ex-vivo per\ufffefusion did not enter the experimental scene until much later.\nThe discovery and success of cyclosporine resulted in a sig\ufffenificant increase in the number of organs being transplanted.\nWith this success, however, came the issue of organ shortage.\nWhile most ideal livers tolerated SCS well, marginal livers\ndid not. Unfortunately, there was no good way to assess the\norgan quality prior to transplantation. As such, there was\nrenewed interest in ex-vivo perfusion as a modality for organ\nevaluation and preservation. One of the earliest experiments in\nnormothermic ex-vivo liver perfusion was performed by Ikeda\net al.18 in 1990, in which six porcine livers previously stored for\n24 hours at 48\nC with the UW solution underwent 3 h of sangui\ufffeneous perfusion either at 328\nC or 378\nC. These organs were\ncompared to six other porcine livers perfused at 378\nC immedi\ufffeately following procurement. The latter group had better portal\nand hepatic artery pressures as well as bile production com\ufffepared to both groups that underwent 24 h of cold storage.18\nExperiments on liver perfusion have equally been driven by\nthe desire to optimize donation after cardiac death (DCD) livers\nprior to transplantation. In 2001, Schön et al.19 used a DCD\nporcine model to demonstrate successful preservation and\ntransplantation of porcine livers. The organs were subjected\nto 1 h of warm ischemia time, followed by 4 h of NMP. While\nnone of the recipients of the six livers subjected to 4 h of SCS\nsurvived for more than 7 days, all six recipients of livers from\nthe NMP group survived.19 About the same time, other inves\ufffetigators showed that NMP could be extended to 72 h, and was\nassociated with better histological preservation, less transami\ufffenase release, improved bile production and superior synthetic/\nmetabolic function.20–24\nMore recent experiments have, again, demonstrated\nimprovement in hemodynamics of the organ, reduction in\nmarkers of ischemia, better avoidance of ischemic and hypo\ufffethermic injury (Ishak score) and better maintenance of hep\ufffeatocyte viability in livers preserved by NMP.25–27 In an attempt\nto investigate the benefits of NMP on Maastricht Category 2\nDCD donors, Fondevilla et al.28 used a DCD porcine model for\nwhich the donor pigs had undergone 90-m cardiac arrest, after\nwhich they were divided into three groups. The first group was\npreserved by SCS, the second and third groups underwent\n60 m of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) perfu\ufffesion before being preserved by SCS or NMP for 4 h respectively.\nThe investigators reported a 0% survival in the SCS group,\n83% survival in the ECMO+SCS group and 100% survival in\nthe ECMO+NMP group. Liver function, endothelial injury, cyto\ufffekine and inflammatory response, and tissue necrosis was worst\nin the SCS group, followed by the ECMO+SCS group and being\nleast in the ECMO+NMP group.28 These findings suggested that\nFig. 1.

The above findings suggest that NMP\nmight be the best option to resuscitate organs exposed to\nextended warm ischemia time, as occurs in DCD donation.\nCurrent procurement protocols require in-situ flushing with\ncold UW solution or histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solu\ufffetion. There is concern regarding the effects of abrupt reperfu\ufffesion on the organ. The concept of controlled oxygenated\nrewarming was introduced by Minor et al.,\n29 initially as an\nadjunct to hypothermic perfusion. Banan et al.30 then com\ufffebined gradual rewarming with NMP and reported improved\nINR, bile production, cholangiocyte function and decreased\nendothelial damage compared to immediate NMP after 4 h of\ncold storage. However, these results were inferior to the group\nthat underwent NMP immediately without 4 h of cold storage.30\nSome investigators have looked at optimizing the outcomes\nfrom NMP through the addition of other adjuncts to the circuit.\nIn 2012, Chung et al.31 described the addition of a kidney to\nthe liver NMP circuit. Although the authors saw no improve\ufffement in inflammatory cytokine expression, subsequent experi\ufffements did find improvements in glucose, pH and renal\nparameters such as urea and creatinine. Liver function did\nnot appear to be compromised. Another study by the same\ngroup demonstrated that placing the kidney in the circuit\nbefore the liver, was more physiologic and produced better\nresults compared to the liver-first circuit.32–34 Although en\nbloc liver-kidney transplants are not mainstream, this finding\nrepresents another area of exploration in patients undergoing\ncombined liver-kidney transplantation.\nOther adjuncts include addition of pharmacologic mole\ufffecules to mitigate ischemic injury. Goldaracena et al.35\ndemonstrated improvement in liver function with the addition\nof anti-inflammatory strategies, including alprostadil and\nn-acetylcysteine. It is worth noting, however, that other studies\nhave shown decreased inflammation with NMP, even in the\nabsence of added anti-inflammatory compounds.36 The\nconcept of the addition of therapeutic compounds to the NMP\nperfusion circuit to improve outcomes following transplanta\ufffetion remains one of the areas of greatest potential growth in\nNMP technology and is, therefore, worth pursuing.\nSmall animal ex-vivo liver perfusion studies\nThere have been a limited number of rodent NMP studies due\nto their small size and lack of appropriate NMP technology, until\nrecently. The smaller size and decreased complexity, however,\noffers the ability to study different aspects of ex-vivo NMP per\ufffefusion at reduced cost. One of the earliest successful ex-vivo\nperfusions of a mouse liver was performed by Baba et al.37 in\n1988. In a proof-of-concept study, the group demonstrated\nstable ATP levels and minimal ischemia after 80 m of ex-vivo\nperfusion with oxygenated fluosol-DA.37 In 2008, Talboom and\ncolleagues38 were able to successfully resuscitate Lewis rat\nlivers using NMP after 45 m of warm ischemia and 2 h of\nsimple cold storage. The animals that received these perfused\nlivers had comparable survival to those with fresh livers, and\ndid better than those who received livers stored by SCS only.38\nThe same group, in 2012, used a mouse DCD model to study\nmachine perfusion/preservation at 208\nC, 308\nC and 378\nC. These\nlivers were subsequently transplanted, allowing for evaluation\nof long-term outcomes. Results showed that compared to SCS,\nwhere none of the recipients survived past 12 h, 100% of the\nrecipients from perfused livers (at all three temperatures)\nsurvived.39\nPerk et al.,\n40 using a DCD rat NMP model, developed a met\ufffeabolic index of ischemic injury that could be used to evaluate\nex-vivo perfused ischemic livers, helping to predict the function\nand, as such, suitability for transplantation. Using perfusate\nglucose, urea and lactate levels, the model was able to distin\ufffeguish between fresh and ischemic livers with 90% specificity.40\nA recent study by Op den Dries et al.41 showed that for both\nDCD and non-DCD rat livers, there was superior bile duct epi\ufffethelial integrity and maintenance of morphology in NMP com\ufffepared to SCS.41 Murine studies have also investigated the\nimpact of liver steatosis on outcomes. Given that liver steatosis\nis major risk factor for primary non-function posttransplanta\ufffetion,42 many investigators have evaluated the use of the NMP\ncircuit to de-fat the liver prior to transplantation, as well as\nmitigate IRI. Negrath et al.,\n43 using various defatting cocktails,\nshowed that successful defatting was associated with improved\nrecovery from IRI.43 Preconditioning of livers on the NMP circuit\nwith Nodosin,44 as well as with thrombomodulin,45 was also\nassociated with improvement in endothelial damage and in IRI.\nClinical studies\nEx-vivo perfusion studies using discarded human livers\n(w/o transplantation)\nDonor organ shortages and increasing use of marginal donor\norgans has been the major driver behind research on normo\ufffethermic ex-vivo perfusion. One of the significant challenges in\nworking with marginal organs is the absence of the necessary\ntools to adequately assess organs prior to transplantation. For\nthis reason, DCD has a high organ discard rate.46 In the USA,\nabout 10% of donated livers are discarded.47 NMP technology\nhas emerged as a means of viability testing, preservation and\nresuscitation of would-be-discarded organs for transplanta\ufffetion. These discarded organs have, in turn, expedited the\ntranslation of ex-vivo perfusion from animals to humans.\nIn 2013, Op den Dries and colleagues48 demonstrated\nthat this technology was feasible in human donor livers.\nFour discarded livers from donors underwent cold storage\nin histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (one in UW solution)\nfor 5–9 h, followed by 6 h of normothermic ex-vivo perfusion\nusing oxygenated packed red blood cells and fresh frozen\nplasma. Histological examination before and after perfusion\nshowed well-preserved morphology, without evidence of\nadditional hepatocellular injury, biliary ischemia or sinusoidal\ndamage. There was bile production from the livers and\ndecreased lactate in the perfusate during the study,48 consis\ufffetent with preserved hepatic function. Banan et al.49 showed a\n10% reduction in macroglobular steatosis with the addition of\nexendin-4 and L-carnitine to the NMP circuit. These findings\ncould be useful in resuscitation of steatotic livers.\nRetrospective studies/case reports in ex-vivo liver\nperfusion\nThere have been several clinical series demonstrating the use\nof NMP, but these have been limited to high-volume centers.\nIn January 2016, Perera et al.50 reported on the first liver\ntransplant from a graft resuscitated by NMP. The liver, which\nhad been subjected to 109 m of warm ischemia and 422 m of\ncold ischemia, had been rejected by all other centers. The\norgan was resuscitated with 416 m of NMP, after which it was\n278 Journal of Clinical and Translational Hepatology 2018 vol. 6 | 276–282\nAkateh C. et al: Ex-vivo liver perfusion – a literature review\n\nsuccessfully transplanted. Overall ex-vivo time from cross\ufffeclamp to reperfusion was 13 h and 58 m. The recipient had\nan uneventful post-transplant course and was doing well at\n15-month follow-up.50\nWatson et al.51,52 also reported on similar successful cases,\nincluding one with 26 h ex-vivo (618-m cold storage, 8.5-h\nNMP perfusion, 412-m SCS). In 2016, Angelico et al.53 con\ufffeducted a retrospective review of six patients who had received\nliver grafts perfused with NMP as part of the OrganOx trial,\ncomparing them to SCS recipients with similar donor and\nrecipient characteristics. They found that NMP was associated\nwith better intraoperative mean arterial pressures at 90 s, less\nvasopressor requirement and less blood products compared to\nSCS.53 Mergental et al.54 also reported on a series of five livers\nthat had been previously rejected (four DCD and one nonDCD\nwith prolonged ischemia). Following resuscitation with the NMP\ncircuit, the livers showed good viability (perfusate lactate, bile\nproduction, vascular flows, and liver appearance). The livers\nwere all transplanted, and at 7 months post-transplant all\npatients were doing well.54\nWatson et al.55 also recently published another series of 12\npatients who received liver transplants from organs preserved\nby NMP. Six of the organs were perfused with perfusate at high\noxygen tensions. In this group, they noted five cases of post\ufffereperfusion syndrome, four cases of sustained vasoplegia and\none of primary non-function. The other six livers with perfusate\ncontaining physiologic oxygen tension did not show these com\ufffeplications, suggesting hyperoxia during NMP could be detri\ufffemental to the organ.55\nClinical trials in ex-vivo perfusion\nIn addition to the case series reported above, there have been\na few Phase 1 pilot studies comparing NMP to SCS, or other\nmodalities. In all three trials, the investigators used the\nOrganOx Metra12 device for normothermic perfusion. Table 1\nsummarizes some of the major findings from these trials.\nThe above-noted Phase 1 trials of normothermic ex-vivo\nperfusion have demonstrated its non-inferiority to SCS.56–58\nIt is worth noting, however, that none of the livers in these\nNMP trials were specifically labeled as extended criteria or mar\ufffeginal organs. In at least two of the trials (Ravikumar et al.56 and\nSelzner et al.58), 80% of the livers were procured from brain\ndead donors. As previously noted, optimal organs generally\ntolerate SCS well, which is why this has been the standard for\ncare the last two to three decades. So, although these have\nbeen non-inferiority trials, it is plausible that the true benefits\nof NMP will be become evident in trials with direct comparison\nusing marginal livers. The authors of current trials have argued\nthat NMP studies using standard livers are necessary to prove\nthe feasibility of the technology before applying it to marginal\nlivers, where it is expected to have the most benefit.\nThere are several Phase 2 and randomized clinical trials\nunderway, and will hopefully address these concerns. The\ncurrent trials have proved the feasibility of this technology in\nliver transplantation.\nPredictions of organ utility/discard\nThere continues to be considerable debate about the best\nparameters to use to truly assess the organ prior to trans\ufffeplantation. Regardless of parameters, however, NMP provides\na means of viability testing not afforded by SCS. Bile formation\nand secretion is generally accepted as a hallmark of liver graft\nfunction. Brockmann et al.24 have shown that bile output\n(as well as base excess, portal vein flow, and hepatocellular\nenzymes) were all markers of liver function in a porcine liver\ntransplant model. Sutton and colleagues59 showed that high\nbile output of more than 30 g in 1 h was consistent with\nlower necrosis and improved potassium and transaminase\nlevels, suggesting that this might be a good marker of viability.\nVarious perfusate markers have also been investigated as\nmarkers of liver function, viability and degree of hepatocyte\ndamage. Karangwa and colleagues60 reported that a high\nD-dimer level early-on in the NMP circuit predicts severe ische\ufffemia of reperfusion and poor graft function. Beta-galactosidase\nlevel in perfusate,61 factor V level,62 perfusate pH62 and bicar\ufffebonate level59 have all been demonstrated as markers of via\ufffebility. Other investigators have combined multiple parameters\nin an attempt to develop an algorithm than could be used to\nevaluate these organs. As previously noted, using a rat DCD\nmodel, Perk et al.40 developed a metabolic index of ischemic\ninjury using perfusate glucose, urea and lactate levels capable\nof distinguishing between fresh and ischemic livers with 90%\nspecificity. Bruinsma et al.63 advocated for the use of metab\ufffeolomics (a comprehensive metabolic profile of the liver’s\ncondition) in combination with typical NMP parameters to\nbetter assess and characterize preserved livers.\nTable 1.

In 1967,\nSlapak et al.,\n14 fashioned a completely portable apparatus for\nhypothermic organ preservation including a 3-atmosphere\noxygen concentrator, which was used successfully to preserve\ncanine liver grafts ex-vivo before transplantation.14 HMP was\nfurther promoted by the development of the UW solution. In\n1990, Yanaga,15 working with Starzl, adapted the model MOX\ufffe100 kidney perfusion machine into an ex-vivo liver perfusion\nsystem. HMP, however, did not gain full acceptance at that time\ndue to the ease of SCS with the UW solution and the cumber\ufffesome nature of the HMP apparatus. Nevertheless, there was\ncontinued progress being made in the field, including multiple\nsmall and large animal studies.\nIn 2010, Guarrera et al.64 published the first prospective\ntrial of HMP in human subjects. In this study, 20 adults who\nreceived HMP-preserved livers were compared to a matched\ngroup of cohorts who had received livers preserved by SCS.\nThe investigators found no significant difference in overall\noutcome between the two groups.64 Since then, there have\nbeen more Phase 1 trials in hypothermic perfusion, including\na study by Guarrera et al.65 in 2015, which compared 31\nextended criteria livers preserved by HMP to 30 matched SCS\ncontrols. The researchers noted significantly less biliary\ncomplications in the HMP group versus the SCS group (4 vs. 13,\np = 0.016). There was one primary graft non-function case in\nthe HMP group and in the SCS group. Additionally, the hospital\nlength of stay was significantly shorter in the HMP group.65\nA similar study by Dutkowski et al. found significantly\ndecreased liver injury (peak alanine aminotransferase, cholan\ufffegiopathy, biliary complications, and graft survival) in DCD\nlivers preserved by hypothermic oxygenated perfusion. They\nalso compared hypothermic oxygenate machine perfusion\ufffeperfused livers to brain dead donors preserved in a standard\nfashion (SCS) and found no significant difference. While HMP\nappears to be advantageous over SCS, there is no clear benefit\nof HMP over NMP. Additionally, there have been no randomized\ntrials directly comparing HMP to NMP. Critics of HMP argue that,\nthis modality does not allow for full functional assessment of\nthe allograft, as the organs are not perfused at physiologic\ntemperature.\nThe future of normothermic ex-vivo perfusion\nThe most immediate need and benefit of ex-vivo donor organ\nperfusion is organ assessment and potential repair prior to\ntransplantation. The inability to adequately assess organs\nhas led to relatively low rate of organ utility, despite an ever\ufffeincreasing need.66,67 NMP and its ability to assess various\norgan parameters, including hepatic and portal artery resist\ufffeance, bile production and changes in transaminases, provide\nvaluable information that would aid in pre-transplant organ\nassessment. By providing a platform for pre-transplant assess\ufffement, NMP will serve to expand the donor pool, especially with\nregards to DCD and steatotic donations, which are often chal\ufffelenging to adequately assess.7,68,69\nOne of the major challenges in liver transplantation is cold\nischemia time and the ability to reduce it. In 2009, Englesbe\net al.70 reported on Surgical Transplantation as one of the\nriskiest jobs in Medicine, owing to the need to procure and\ntransplant organs as quickly as possible.70 In many hospitals,\ntransplants are done at odd hours of the day, as organs must\nbe transplanted immediately to decrease cold ischemia time.\nNMP ex-vivo perfusion allows the ability to preserve the organ\nfor longer periods and to transplant it at a scheduled/desired\ntime. Not only can patients get their affairs in order, but trans\ufffeplant surgeons will be able to have rest periods between pro\ufffecurement and transplantation.\nMoreover, NMP has shown great promise in its ability to\npotentially mitigate the IRI associated with the procurement and\npreservation process, allowing for transplantation of improved\norgans. Extension of perfusion time, equally has potential\napplicability in combined organ transplantation. Ceulemans\net al.,\n71 in 2014, reported on the case of a patient with severe\ncystic fibrosis leading to pulmonary failure and liver fibrosis. The\npatient in that case underwent ex-vivo lung perfusion while the\nliver was being transplanted, as his liver disease was deemed\ntoo severe to allow for a lung transplant.71 A similar model could\nbe applied in a patient with more severe lung disease or heart\ndisease, who is unable to tolerate a liver transplant first. The\nliver could be placed on the NMP circuit, avoiding further cold\nischemia time while the other organ is being transplanted.\nAdditionally, exploratory therapies are now associated with\nNMP. One suggestion has been the addition of mesenchymal\nstem cells to the NMP circuit, to hopefully induce immune\ntolerance in the graft.72 Anti-apoptotic agents and cell protec\ufffetive agents can be added into the perfusate as a means to re\ufffeengineer suboptimal organs to better tolerate IRI.73 Although\nnone of these have been employed in clinical trials or clinical\npractice, the opportunities abound. In a recent study, Goldar\ufffeacena et al.74 reported on the recent use of the ex-vivo\nperfusion circuit to deliver Miravirsen to prevent hepatitis C\nvirus reinfection in porcine livers. This study, if translated to\nhuman livers, could have significant implications for the use\nhepatitis C virus-infected liver grafts, potentially in non\ufffeinfected recipients. The technique could also be extended to\npotential donors with other systemic infections or infectious\nrisk, expanding the donor pool.\nConclusions\nDespite the great success of liver transplantation, the current\ndonor organ shortage and the changes in donor demographics\nhave placed an increased emphasis on the ability to safely use\nmarginal organs. Although it has shown great promise in\nanimal studies and early clinical series, there is still a paucity\nof robust human trials on NMP to date. The efficacy and\nsuperiority of this preservation technique to current methods\nwill have to be demonstrated to justify the additional cost.\nConflict of interest\nThe authors have no conflict of interests related to this\npublication.\nAuthor contributions\nContributed to the study design (CA, EWB, SMB), manuscript\nwriting and critical revision (CA, EWB, BAW, SMB).\n280 Journal of Clinical and Translational Hepatology 2018 vol. 6 | 276–282\nAkateh C. et al: Ex-vivo liver perfusion – a literature review\n\nReferences\n[1] National Data – OPTN. 2017.

The review highlights the potential benefits of ex-vivo liver perfusion, such as improved liver function, reduced inflammation, and increased viability of marginal or extended criteria donor livers. The review also discusses the limitations and challenges of ex-vivo liver perfusion, including the need for further optimization of perfusion circuits, the identification of biomarkers for predicting liver viability, and the development of strategies for preventing ischemic injury and promoting regenerative processes. The review concludes by emphasizing the importance of continuing research in this field to fully realize the potential of ex-vivo liver perfusion as a promising strategy for expanding the donor pool and improving liver transplantation outcomes.",0.9375,0.8350719765755822,FULL_PAPER

HOPE and SCS groups resulted with similar basal characteristics, both for \nrecipients and donors. Cumulative liver and kidney graft dysfunction were 10% (HOPE L-K) vs. 31.7%, \nin SCS group (p=0.05). Primary non-function was 3.3% for SCS-L vs. 0% for HOPE-L. No primary non\ufffefunction was reported in HOPE-K and SCS-K. Median peak aspartate aminotransferase within 7-days \npost-LT was significantly higher in SCS-L when compared to HOPE-L (637 vs.344U/L, p=0.007). Graft \nsurvival at 1-year post-transplant was 93.3% for SCS-L vs. 100% of HOPE-L and 90% for SCS-K vs. 100% \nof HOPE-K. Clinical outcomes support our hypothesis of machine perfusion being a safe and effective \nsystem to reduce ischemic preservation injuries in KT and in LT.\nThe gap between patients candidate to liver or kidney transplant and the actual organ availability is a prominent \nissue for transplant centres worldwide, and has a significant impact for such patients in terms of morbidity and \nmortality1,2\n. Nevertheless, the number of discarded organs is increasing constantly, primarily as a consequence of \nthe increasing average age of the donor pool1\n.\nSeveral data demonstrate how the use of marginal liver and kidney allografts, defined according to the \nExtended Criteria Donors(ECD), may represent a valid strategy to enlarge the donor pool and to offer more \ntransplant opportunities otherwise unachievable only with Standard Criteria Donors (SCD)3–6\n. However, the use \nof ECD organs still entails a considerable price to pay: an increase of primary non-function (PNF) or delayed \ngraft function (DGF) in kidney transplant (KT) and early allograft dysfunction (EAD) in liver transplant (LT), \nand a decrease of long-term survival7\n not related to the experience of the transplant centers8\n. Cold ischemia time \n(CIT) and warm ischemia time during reperfusion impair ECD grafts – being those highly vulnerable organs \n– but at the same time do not increase mortality risk, which remains relevant for patients in waiting list9\n.

Different \ninnovative preservation methods in KT and LT are currently under investigation in animal models, pre-clinical \nand clinical trials, comparing different strategies, ranging from hypothermic (4–10 °C) to subnormothermic (20–\n25 °C) – including controlled oxygenated rewarming – and normothermic (35–37 °C) conditions10. Early clinical \nevidences from the Zurich group support the benefit of hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) as confirmed \nfor LT clinically11 and on rat models for KT experimentally12. Conversely, in United Kingdom, normothermic \nmachine perfusion (NMP) for preservation of LT and KT achieved an optimal safety, feasibility and efficacy13,14. \nSubnormothermic machine perfusion (SMP) and controlled oxygenated rewarming (COR) were experienced \nin animal models demonstrating the improvement in renal or liver function and superiority when compared \nto SCS15–17, but to present only COR in LT was applied in clinical practice with good results of feasibility and \nshort-term transplant outcomes18.\nOur preliminary experimental study on human discarded kidneys and liver grafts19 lead us to confirm the \nrole of dynamic preservation and the need for oxygen provision to restore ATP levels, despite the fact that their \nclinical marginal features had labeled such organs as un-transplantable. Therefore, based on our previous findings \nand several positive suggestions above mentioned11,12, we designed an interventional clinical trial to apply HOPE \nas preservation technique in liver and kidney transplant procedure. HOPE was performed through a machine \nperfusion purposely developed for abdominal organs perfusion in our center. Outcomes data were elaborated to \ndetermine safety and efficacy of HOPE treatment in extended criteria donors after brain death (ECD-DBD) for \nLT and KT.\nResults\nDonor and recipient characteristics. Between October 2016 and December 2017, N= 20 recipients \n(N=10 LT recipients and N=10 KT recipients) were recruited consecutively and transplanted with ECD-DBD \norgans preserved from surgical back-table to implantation by HOPE (Table\xa01). The main indication for LT was \nhepatocellular carcinoma on cirrhosis with one or more etiologies: alcoholic liver disease (N=2), hepatitis C \nvirus infection (N=5), hepatitis B and D virus infection (N=2), hepatitis B virus infection (N=1) and primary \nbiliary cirrhosis (N=1); only one patient was affected by alcoholic cirrhosis only. Recipients of KT had end-stage \nrenal disease with the following etiologies: interstitial nephritis (N=1), renal polycystosis (N=2), hypertensive \nrenal vascular disease (N=1), diabetic nephropathy (N=1), hypertensive nephrosclerosis (N=2), membranous \nglomerulonephritis (N=1), nephroangiosclerosis (N=1) and chronic glomerulonephritis (N=1).\nThe study population was properly matched with the control group (Table\xa01) and no significative differences \nwere reported between the two groups.\nMedian donor age was very extended: 77.5 (60–84) years for HOPE-L group and 71.5 (60–78) years\ufffefor HOPE-K group compared to 75.5 (53–85) years for SCS-L group and 69.5 (59–79) years for SCS-K group \n(p=n.s.).\nMedian recipient age was 57.5 (50–68) years for HOPE-L group and 61 (50–66) years for HOPE-K group \nversus 60.5 (48–68) years for SCS-L group and SCS-K group (p=n.s.).\nIn the L-HOPE group, the median CIT was 7.1 (6.1–9.6) hours: a value time comparable to 7 (5.4–10) of \nL-SCS group and very low because the perfusion treatment started at the time of the organ back-table and the \nlivers were immediately transplanted.\nSperimental Group Control group\nHOPE SCS P value\nLiver Transplantation N=10 N=30\nDonor Age 77.5 (60–84) years 75.5 (53–85) years 0.396\nRecipient Age 57.5 (50–68) years 60.5 (48–68) years 0.331\nCold Ischemia Time 7.1 (6.1–9.6) hours 7 (5.4–10) hours 0.528\nMELD score 13 (7–16) 13.5 (7–20) 0.963\nPrevious abdominal surgery 5 (50%) 13 (43.3%) 0.681\nPortal thrombosis 1 (10%) 3 (10%) 1\nKidney Transplantation N=10 N=30\nDonor Age 71.5 (60–78) years 69.5 (59–79) years 0.653\nRecipient Age 61 (50–65) years 60.5 (48–68) years 0.851\nCold Ischemia Time 14.5 (10.8–22) hours 14 (8–21) hours 0.896\nKarpinsky’s score median 4 3 0.105\nType of Dialysis\nPeritoneal dialysis 4 (40%) 9 (30%) 0.492\nHemodialysis 6 (60%) 21 (70%)\nDialysis Time 47.3 (19.6–108) months 47.3 (7.6–139.2) months\nTable 1.

Primary non-function was 0% for both K-groups and 6.6% for SCS-L vs. \n0% for HOPE-L, p=0.086.\nL-HOPE group had 0% of EAD versus 23.3% of L-SCS group. As result of this data, the peak of aspartate \naminotransferase within 7-days post-LT decreased over 50%: the median value of AST was 637 (124–2100) U/L \nin L-SCS group vs. 344 (166–1032) U/L in L-HOPE group, p=0.006 (Fig.\xa01). Also, alanine aminotransferase, \nbilirubin and INR levels were lower in L-HOPE recipients than in the L-SCS group.\nLiver graft assessment following transplantation (L-GrAFT) risk score decreased significantly in the L-HOPE \ngroup, with a L-GrAFT risk score percentage of 18.82±7.10%, compared to 27.03±11.36% in L-SCS group \n(p=0.047).\nLooking at the kidney transplant subset, the study population showed a trend to a better outcome, with only \n20% of DGF compared to 40% in the control group. The only two DGF events in the HOPE-K group took place \nwhen the perfusion time for single KT was lower than 2 hours; the remaining 8 cases in the HOPE-K group \nhad no DGF events. Comparing K-HOPE patients receiving a graft which underwent perfusion treatment for \nmore than 2 hours to grafts with shorter perfusion time, the rate of DGF was statistically significant (0% vs. \n40%, p=0.04). Overall, early post-operative complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification were \ncomparable among the study groups, without reaching any statistical significance (see Supplementary Materials \nTables\xa03, 4).\nBiliary/ureteral strictures and organ rejection. Biliary and ureteral strictures were monitored for 1 \nyear of follow-up after transplant, without observing differences in HOPE recipients vs. SCS group [L-HOPE \ngroup=1/10 (10%) versus L-SCS group=3/30 (10%); K-HOPE group=1/10 (10%) versus K-SCS group=2/30 \n(6.6%)]. Likewise, the incidence of acute rejection was similar between study and control groups [L-HOPE \ngroup=1/10 (10%) versus L-SCS group=4/30 (13.3%); K-HOPE group=1/10 (10%) versus K-SCS group=2/30 \n(6.6%)].\nHospitalization, graft and patient survival. No significative differences were reported in term of \nmedian hospital stay for LT (11 days HOPE vs. 12 days SCS) and KT (17 days HOPE vs. 24 days SCS). All grafts \nand patients in the HOPE groups survived at 1-year post-transplant, with no significative differences when com\ufffepared to control groups. In the L-SCS group graft survival was 90% due to two PNF events and one case of mul\ufffetiorgan failure secondary to sepsis; moreover, patients’ survival was 90%: one death for infectious complication \nand two for recurrence of liver disease. In the K-SCS group, graft survival was 93.3% due to two graft failure cases, \none due to renal vein thrombosis in single renal transplant and one due to multiorgan failure following bacterial \nsepsis in dual renal transplant; patient survival was 96.6% due to one event of death for infectious complication \n(Table\xa04).\nNGAL in perfusate correlates with better renal transplant outcome. We splitted HOPE-K recipi\ufffeents in two different subsets, based on NGAL median value detected at T1 (19pg/mL) and we monitored eGFR of \nHOPE-K group at 1st, 3rd and 6th month after kidney transplantation: patients with perfusate NGAL>19pg/mL \nreported significantly higher eGFR at each time point (Fig.\xa02). Non statistically significant correlations between \nother markers of acute kidney injury and eGFR at 1st, 3rd and 6th month after kidney transplantation are shown in \nSupplementary Materials Fig.\xa01.\nIn the liver perfusate (HOPE-L), pGST, Albumin and Beta2-microglobulin were detected with increased val\ufffeues at T2 when compared to T0 (Supplementary Materials Table\xa05), but no statistically significant linear cor\uffferelations are evidenced when compared with AST, ALT and total bilirubin (at 1st, 3rd and 6th month after liver \ntransplantation), or CIT and time of perfusion (Table\xa03).\nWe also measured NGAL, Calbindin, Clusterin and Osteopontin in the liver perfusate: we reported different \nvalues in T1 compared to T0 (Supplementary Materials Table\xa05) with non statistically significant linear correla\ufffetions when compared with AST, ALT and total bilirubin (at 1st, 3rd and 6th month after liver transplantation), or \nCIT and time of perfusion (Table\xa03).\nResults are further detailed in Supplementary Materials.\nSperimental Group\nHOPE\nLiver HOPE N=10\nVein Portal Flow 107.5 (65–116) mL/min\nLactate post HOPE 16.2 (9–27) mg/dL\nPerfusion Time 2.2 (1–3.5) hours\nKidney HOPE N=10\nRenal Flow 52.5 (24–85) mL/min\nLactate post HOPE 11.7 (6.3–22.5) mg/dL\nPerfusion Time 3.3 (1–6) hours\nTable 3.

While administration of oxygen \nthrough machine perfusion for liver preservation was largely investigated in a previous clinical study20, few \nreports described HOPE in KT21. Since 1964, several in vivo and preclinical studies report the oxygen use in \nhyperbaric and normobaric conditions to perfuse renal grafts22,23. Here, we report the first clinical trial of HOPE \nin kidney transplant, reporting safety and efficacy in reducing ischemic preservation injuries.\nThe use of the same perfusion device for liver and kidney grafts results as one of the most innovative find\ufffeing of the present study compared to other previous studies11,13,14,24: organ perfusion with this machine is easily \nperformed and it may be initiated at the time of surgical graft preparation during the “back-table” procedures, \navoiding unnecessary CIT extension.\nAn increasing number of researches suggest how the beginning of hypothermic oxygenated perfusion soon \nafter graft retrieval promotes the reduction of waste products, such as succinates, that usually accumulate in the \ngraft during static storage, and increasing the restoring of mitochondrial function25,26.\nOur protocol begins with a 30–40 minutes graft washing during organ preparation, with the aim to remove \nwaste products commonly released and accumulated during ischemia time. Furthermore, we equipped our organ \nperfusion system with an adsorbing hemofilter able to remove cytokines and to avoid fat embolism. After the \nwashing phase, oxygenation of the preservation solution begins, with recirculation of the same fluid. We believe \nthis strategy may replace the necessity to immediately start graft perfusion at the end of the retrieval, if CIT is \nmaintained low, as in our study. Metabolites quantification in the perfusates during the flushing phase, compared \nto the usual perfusion time, may demonstrate the benefit of the washing strategy prior to recirculation of HOPE. \nThe limit of our study is due to the lack of these data.\nThe missing of additional perfusates at regular times during perfusion, may represent a further limitation: a \nregular analysis of perfusates could be helpful to better understand organ metabolism during perfusion.\nIn the present study no adverse events were reported as a consequence of perfusion treatment and the out\ufffecome was excellent, with no occurrence of graft dysfunction in HOPE-L despite advanced donor age. No graft \nfailure was registered in HOPE-K, and only two cases had DGF. Moreover, recipients in HOPE-K with DGF \nhad undergone perfusion treatment for less than two hours, as compared to non-DGF patients which actually \nunderwent perfusion treatment for more than 2hours. Therefore, based on our experience, we suggest that kidney \nperfusion should last at least two hours; this treatment time could be possibly longer, as suggested by a pre-clinical \nstudy27.\nThis clinical series – to the best of our knowledge – is the first report of HOPE in ECD kidney transplantation; \ntherefore, there are no data about renal preservation issues to compare our results with. Similarly to HOPE-L \nwhich is performed for at least one-hour, HOPE for renal grafts should last at least two hours, but future rand\ufffeomized trials are needed to clarify this hypothesis11.\nMany studies, even from our center, showed that hypothermic oxygenation during organ perfusion is able to \nrestore ATP levels in liver and kidney grafts, improving the functional recovery after transplantation19,28,29. Our \nclinical results showed a better liver function with HOPE compared to SCS in the setting of marginal donation, \nwithout reported EAD events and lower hepatocellular enzyme release.

This result is similar to that reported by Nasralla and colleagues in a con\ufffetrolled prospective randomized trial on liver normothermic perfusion following organ retrieval30.\nFurthermore, in the liver subset, post-operative liver function was improved in the liver HOPE group accord\ufffeing to the L-GrAFT risk score.\nIn addition to this positive clinical data, other relevant aspects of HOPE should be considered: first of all, the \nprocedure proposed is simple in terms of organization and management; in particular, in our experience, a spe\ufffecialist perfusion technician was not required, and we had no adverse events related to the procedure. Secondly, \nthe perfusion machine is cost-effective and less expensive compared to the subnormothermic or normothermic \ntechniques. HOPE is performed requiring only a sterile perfusion line kit, including an oxygenator; on the other \nhand, subnormothermia or normothermia conditions require packed red blood cells or haemoglobin-based \noxygen carriers, various perfusion solutions (i.e. Ringer’s solution), nutrient elements including multivitamins, \nsodium bicarbonate, heparin, antibiotics, prostacyclin, nutrient solution and creatinine. A further positive aspect \nof HOPE management, is the effectiveness of the strategy proposed despite advanced donor age in liver but also \nin kidney transplantation, with no graft loss due to non-function or dysfunction reported.\nIn this manuscript, we report only 1-year of clinical outcomes follow-up, including organ function, graft and \npatient survival; nevertheless the lower L-GrAFT risk score reported in the liver study group may suggest a better \ngraft survival with a prolonged follow-up.\nRecently, 5-year outcomes in donors after circulatory death (DCD) human livers preserved with HOPE were \nreported similar to DBD liver grafts and superior to the DCD liver grafts preserved with SCS31. Long-term out\ufffecomes of machine perfusion in renal storage was reported only in the setting of hypothermic machine perfusion \nwithout oxygen. However, graft and patient survival were superior in the machine perfusion groups compared to \nthe SCS groups, with the equalization of usage costs achieved at the 16th month post-transplant32. In our opinion, \nFigure 1. Peak AST within 7 days of the liver SCS and HOPE groups. AST, aspartate aminotransferase; SCS, \nstatic cold storage; HOPE, hypothermic oxygenated perfusion.\nFigure 2.

The safety of our new machine perfusion system was confirmed by the absence of \nadverse events and by the observation that liver hypothermic oxygenation could be effective to improve graft \nfunction, similarly to other reported series in the setting of normothermic blood perfusion30,33.\nWe also measured different markers in perfusates at the beginning and the end of perfusion procedure. \nRegarding KT, NGAL resulted a positive predictive biomarker of renal outcomes at 1st, 3rd and 6th month of fol\ufffelow up: despite NGAL is largely known as a marker for acute and chronic renal injuries34–36, this result partially \ncorrelates with our previous findings, suggesting the role of NGAL as an immunomodulatory molecule, able to \npromote immune tolerance through regulatory T cells (Treg)37,38 therefore favoring better clinical outcomes.\nIn LT, significative differences of all perfusate markers were reported when measured at the end of perfusion if \ncompared with the beginning. Recently Dutkosky et al.\n39 demonstrated that mitochondrial flavin levels in perfu\ufffesates during hypothermic oxygenated perfusion might be a marker of better liver graft function. Our preliminary \nresults confirm the relevance of markers in the perfusate and the fact that perfusate analysis is a further tool to \npredict clinical grafts outcomes. We are currently exploring a new field where further studies involving a larger \nsample size and a more comprehensive panel of biomarkers are needed, with the aim to detect optimal targetable \nmarkers to correlate with graft function or to confirm the results of Zurich center.\nSummarizing, we consider our innovative system as a functional tool to allow marginal grafts transplanta\ufffebility, with the aim to reduce utilization avoidance of grafts which are actually discarded19,40,41. Moreover, the \nanalysis of the perfusate may help to evaluate organ viability even in hypothermic conditions, and the infusion of \ntherapeutic agents – e.g. nutrition, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and extracellular vesicles releasing by MSC, \nanti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic additives – might be a simple implement of the perfusion system in use42–45.\nFuture trials exploring this field must confirm not only safety and benefits, but also cost effectiveness, as some \nperfusion strategies are still associated with exorbitant costs.\nIn conclusion, HOPE for ECD-DBD grafts is safe and effective in reducing preservation injury and in improv\ufffeing graft function and outcomes for kidney and liver transplantation. Future randomized clinical studies with a \nrepresentative sample size are needed to confirm our results and hypothesis.\nMethods\nStudy design. This national, single-center, prospective interventional arm with a retrospective case-con\ufffetrolled arm, pilot non-randomized clinical study was performed at the General Surgery and Transplant Unit of \nUniversity of Bologna Sant’Orsola - Malpighi Hospital in accordance to the Helsinki Declaration. Ethical approval \nwas obtained by local committee of University of Bologna Sant’Orsola - Malpighi Hospital in June 2016. The \nenrolment process of the interventional study arm was planned considering one procedure per month (liver or \nkidney perfusion before transplantation) following the inclusion criteria in the period from October 2016 to \nDecember 2017. The study was meant to evaluate the safety of a new machine perfusion system, and therefore we \ndecided to monitor adverse events after each procedure for the first 30 post-operative days before enrolling other \nnew cases. During the study period we performed 116 LTs, 60 of which met the inclusion criteria and 10 of which \nwere included in the study according to the aforementioned safety protocol. Similarly we recluted 60 KTs, which \nmet the inclusion criteria, and among those 10 were included according to the protocol. The study underwent \nclinical trial registration (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03031067; 01/25/2017). The organ allocation process fol\ufffelowed our center algorithm6,8,46,47. Each patient included in the study group was transplanted with ECD graft, liver \nor kidney, restored in the pre-implantation phase by HOPE. Patients’ outcomes (HOPE-L and HOPE-K groups) \nwere compared to the ones of matched control groups composed by liver and kidney recipients transplanted from \nJanuary 2004 to September 2017 in the same transplant center, whose organs were preserved by SCS (SCS-L and \nSCS-K groups respectively).\nDemographical, clinical, machine perfusion and histological data collection was performed prospectively for \nthe study groups and retrospectively for the control groups.\nMatching study and control cases. Study cases of HOPE-L and HOPE-K groups were matched 1:3 to \ncontrol cases of SCS-L and SCS-K groups; the pairing was performed anonymously using different clinical fea\ufffetures about each donor and recipient involved.\nHOPE-L and SCS-L groups were matched for donor and recipient age, CIT, model of end-stage liver disease \n(MELD) score, previous abdominal surgery and portal thrombosis.\nHOPE-K and SCS-K groups were matched for donor and recipient age, (CIT), Karpinski’s score, dialyses type \n(peritoneal or hemodialysis) and dialyses time.\nRecipient and donor selection. ECD-DBDs aged over 18 years were considered eligible for study inclusion \nafter acquisition of informed consent by the family. Definition of ECD was applied according to the UNOS crite\uffferia for kidney transplant (donors aged ≥60 years or aged 50–59 years with two or more other risk factors such as \ncerebrovascular accident, hypertension and serum creatinine >1.5mg/dL) and for liver transplant (donors with \nhemodynamic deterioration, age >65 years, BMI>30 kg/m2\n, bilirubin >3 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase \n(AST) o alanine aminotransferase (ALT) above three times the upper reference threshold, sodium >165mmol/l, \ndays on intensive care unit (ICU)>7, steatosis >40%, CIT>14 hours48,49).\nRecipients aged over 18 years on liver/kidney waiting list to University of Bologna Sant’Orsola - Malpighi \nHospital with favorable donor match were selected and included in the trial after acceptation of the informed \nconsensus.\n\nScientific Reports | (2020) 10:6063 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-62979-9 8\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/ www.nature.com/scientificreports\nCombined organ transplant, donors or recipients with vascular anomalies, urgency transplants and \nre-transplantations were excluded from the study enrollment.\nOrgan retrieval and transfer. Livers/kidneys were harvested in a standard fashion and according to our \npolicy for ECD5,50–52. At the end of the retrieval procedures, the organs were stored in cooling sterile bag with \nnew SCS solution and transported to the transplant hospital, where we started the perfusion protocol in the study \ngroup.\nLiver graft histopathological analysis. In order to verify the homogeneity between HOPE-L and SCS-L \ngroups, as well as between HOPE-K and SCS-K groups, the graft histopathology was revised by two different \npathologists in all cases.\nHypothermic oxygenated perfusion. After notification to the Health National System for the clinical use \nin organ perfusion, an innovative machine perfusion developed and described in a previous experimental study19\nwas used to perform ex-vivo hypothermic oxygenated perfusion.\nThis machine perfusion is composed by two pump units that produce a continuous and pulsatile flow to the \nvein or artery respectively, which is set at high values for liver perfusion (median value over 100mL/min) and at \nlower values for kidney perfusion (median value minor to 60mL/min).\nBefore HOPE set-up, the inner and outer sterile flow tubes were connected to the medical devices and the \npriming phase was started. Belzer University of Wisconsin machine perfusion solution was used for priming \nand organ perfusion steps. At the begin of surgical back-table, portal vein or renal artery were cannulated with \nspecial cannulas for organ perfusion of different sizes (8–12 F for kidney and 18–24F for liver). Each organ was \nconnected to the perfusion device through the attachment of the vascular cannula to the inner perfusion tubes, \nalready assembled to the machine. HOPE was performed at 4 °C, with a portal vein pressure of 5mmHg or renal \nartery pressure of 25mmHg and an oxygen partial pressure (paO2) of 600–750mmHg. Oxygen is provided to the \nfluid perfusion through the addition of a membrane oxygenator to the perfusion circuit. Flow, pressure and tem\ufffeperature values were monitored frequently by the organ perfusion team involved and registered on USB memory \nsupport. Perfusate gas analysis were accomplished every 15 minutes on effluent perfusate samples to measure \npaO2, pH, and lactate production.\nSterility of perfusion treatment under study was tested performing microbial cultures on perfusion fluid \nbefore (T0) and after HOPE (T1).\nHypothermic oxygenated perfusion was performed in two steps: the first one was the flushing of the organ \nwith hypothermic oxygenated solution for a duration of 30–40 minutes, and during the second step the organs \nwere moved in a different box to permit recirculation of the perfusate until implantation.\nGraft flushing started at the beginning of the back-table phase, thus without increasing the duration of the \nstandard surgical steps. Flushing was performed with hypothermic oxygenated solution and after 30–40minutes \nof graft flushing, the organs were moved in the another organ container to permit recirculation of the oxygenated \nperfusate. The algorithm treatment is reported in Fig.\xa03.\nTransplantation. According to the conventional procedures, surgical team performed kidney and liver \ntransplants. Renal transplants were accomplished into iliac fossa anastomosing the artery to the external/com\ufffemon/internal iliac arteries, the vein to the external/common iliac veins and the ureter to the bladder over a single \nstent. Orthotopic liver transplantation was performed with “piggyback” technique preserving the inferior vena \ncava; epato-choledocal anastomoses were performed over T-tube.\nShort and long-term post-operative course. Post-transplant medical care during the hospital stay, \nincluding antithrombotic and antimicrobial/antifungal prophylaxis, was managed applying the standard pro\ufffetocols53,54. According to transplant guidelines, immunosuppressive state of recipients was preserved administer\ufffeing induction therapy for KT, tacrolimus (optimal levels: 3–12ng/mL) with or without mycophenolate as either \nmycophenolatemofetil or mycophenolate sodium steroid dose decreasing. Long-term follow-up was carried out \naccording to the local protocols at 1-, 3-, 6- and -12 post-transplant months, in a single-center without loss of \npatients at follow-up.\nTransplant outcome. Graft survival as time, incidence of PNF and graft function as percentage of Liver \nGraft Assessment Following Transplantation (L-GrAFT) risk score or incidence of EAD for LT or DGF for KT \nwere the measure tools to establish the HOPE effects on ECD-DBD donation in LT and KT. PNF was defined as \norgan failure ending to re-transplant for LT or constant dialyses recovery/transplantectomy for KT. EAD was \ndefined if one or more of these lab values appeared: bilirubin>10mg/dL on post-operative day 7; INR>1.6 on \npost-operative day 7; aminotransferase level (ALT or AST)>2000 IU/mL within the first 7 post-operative days55. \nLGrAFT risk score was calculated on 1–10 post-LT days of AST, bilirubin, platelet counts and maximum INR \nvalues56. DGF was defined as the needing of dialyses treatment within the first week after the transplant; the effect \non the outcome is expressed as an absolute number outcome57. Other follow-up data under study were: functional \nlab test values at 1-, 3-, 6- and -12 post-transplant months, incidence of biliary/ureteral fistula, incidence of graft \nrejection and the number of hospital readmission within 1 year from transplant.\nPerfusate analyses. 5mL of perfusate were collected at the beginning (T0) and at the end (T1) of perfusion \nfrom the perfusion fluid in the organ container and centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 15min to remove cellular debris. \nThe supernatant was transferred to 1-mL Coming cryogenic vials immediately after centrifugation and stored at \n−80’C for subsequent analysis. Samples were thawed at room temperature prior to use for analyses. The concen\ufffetrations of early biomarkers of renal injury (Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin-NGAL, Osteopontin, \n\nScientific Reports | (2020) 10:6063 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-62979-9 9\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/ www.nature.com/scientificreports\nBeta2-microglobulin, Clusterin, Cystatin-C, Calbindin, Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1-MCP) and specific \nmarkers of liver functions (Glutathione S-transferases phosphorylate-pGST, ALbumin, Beta2-microglobulin) \nwere measured using Luminex® xMAP® Technology. We created our own multiplex panel by combining mul\ufffetiple simplex kits: Human CustemProcarta Plex-19 plex (Invitrogen by Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. No.PPX\ufffe19-MXRWE2G) and Human High Sensitivity T Cell (Merck Millipore, Cat. No. HSTCMAG-28SK). The \nmethodological details including assay protocol, standards and sensitivity are available at the manufacturer’s \nwebsite, http://www.thermofisher.com and http://www.merckmillipore.com. All samples were measured undi\ufffeluted and in doublets. The chemo/cytokine standards were assayed in the same manner as patient samples. The \ndata were collected using a xPONENT® software (Luminex, Austin, TX, USA).\nStudy end points. The primary end point were the safety in the interventional arm and differences in terms \nof graft function between the two study groups. Graft function was measured considering the EAD for the liver \nand the DGF for the kidney. Liver function was also evaluated considering the L-GrAFT risk core and the peak of \naspartate aminotransferase within 7-days post-LT.\nThe secondary en points included: graft and patient survival at one-year, post-operative complications accord\ufffeing to Clavien-Dindo classification and hospital stay.\nStatistical analyses. Continuous data are reported as mean ± SD or median (range) depending on their \ndistribution and compared by means of parametric (ANOVA, T test) or non-parametric (Mann-Whitney \nU test) analyses. Categorical data are presented as percentage values and compared using a Chi-squared test. \nKaplan-Meier estimators were applied to perform the survival analysis. A p value <0.05 was considered as sta\ufffetistically significant.\nFurther details are provided in the Supplementary Material.\nOrgans/tissues procured.

The study involved 10 liver and 10 kidney transplantations using HOPE, as well as a historical control group consisting of 20 liver and 20 kidney transplantations without HOPE. The study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of HOPE in these high-risk populations, as well as identify potential predictors of graft function and survival. The study found that HOPE significantly improved graft function and reduced the incidence of primary non-function in both liver and kidney transplantations. Additionally, HOPE led to a significant reduction in post-operative liver enzyme levels in liver transplantations. The study highlights the potential of HOPE technology to expand the donor pool and improve outcomes in high-risk transplant candidates. Further studies are needed to validate these findings and optimize HOPE protocols for different types of organs and donors.

What are the current research/knowledge gaps in standardizing perfusion protocols?,"['R E S EARCH Open Access\nGoal-directed intraoperative therapy based on\nautocalibrated arterial pressure waveform analysis\nreduces hospital stay in high-risk surgical\npatients: a randomized, controlled trial\nJochen Mayer*\n, Joachim Boldt, Andinet M Mengistu, Kerstin D Röhm, Stefan Suttner\nAbstract\nIntroduction: Several studies have shown that goal-directed hemodynamic and fluid optimization may result in\nimproved outcome. However, the methods used were either invasive or had other limitations. The aim of this\nstudy was to perform intraoperative goal-directed therapy with a minimally invasive, easy to use device (FloTrac/\nVigileo), and to evaluate possible improvements in patient outcome determined by the duration of hospital stay\nand the incidence of complications compared to a standard management protocol.\nMethods: In this randomized, controlled trial 60 high-risk patients scheduled for major abdominal surgery were\nincluded. Patients were allocated into either an enhanced hemodynamic monitoring group using a cardiac index\nbased intraoperative optimization protocol (FloTrac/Vigileo device, GDT-group, n = 30) or a standard management\ngroup (Control-group, n = 30), based on standard monitoring data.\nResults: The median duration of hospital stay was significantly reduced in the GDT-group with 15 (12 - 17.75) days\nversus 19 (14 - 23.5) days (P = 0.006) and fewer patients developed complications than in the Control-group [6\npatients (20%) versus 15 patients (50%), P = 0.03]. The total number of complications was reduced in the GDT\ufffegroup (17 versus 49 complications, P = 0.001).\nConclusions: In high-risk patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, implementation of an intraoperative goal\ufffedirected hemodynamic optimization protocol using the FloTrac/Vigileo device was associated with a reduced\nlength of hospital stay and a lower incidence of complications compared to a standard management protocol.\nTrial Registration: Clinical trial registration information: Unique identifier: NCT00549419\nIntroduction\nThere is growing evidence that perioperative goal-direc\ufffeted therapy (GDT) based on flow-related hemodynamic\nparameters improves patient outcome [1,2], particularly\nin high-risk patients [3,4]. Mean arterial blood pressure\n(MAP) and central venous pressure (CVP) are routinely\nused to monitor hemodynamics, but no information on\nblood flow can be obtained with MAP and CVP. There\ufffefore, enhanced hemodynamic monitoring seems to be\ncrucial in the guidance of perioperative volume therapy\nand cardiocirculatory support. Previous optimization\nstudies vary largely with regard to study design and the\ncomplexity of the monitoring technique used. Most of\nthe trials used the pulmonary artery catheter (PAC)\n[5-8] and the esophagus Doppler (ED) method [9-11].\nThese methods are either highly invasive (PAC) or show\nlimited accuracy (ED) [12] combined with other disad\ufffevantages such as frequent dislocation of the ultrasound\nprobe [13] or poor toleration in awake patients [14].\nIn the present study, we used the FloTrac/Vigileo, a\nminimally invasive device, which only needs standard\narterial access for enhanced, flow-based hemodynamic\nmonitoring. The device is reported to be easy to use\nand easy to set up [15] and calculates the stroke volume\non the basis of the arterial waveform in combination\n* Correspondence: j-mayer@gmx.de\nDepartment of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Klinikum\nLudwigshafen, Bremserstrasse, 79, 67063 Ludwigshafen, Germany\nMayer et al.

Recent studies have shown a\ngood agreement compared with more invasive methods\nto determine cardiac output (CO) [16-19]. In this study\nwe aimed to determine whether an intraoperative opti\ufffemization protocol using the enhanced flow-based hemo\ufffedynamic parameters of the FloTrac/Vigileo device would\nresult in an improvement in outcome in high-risk\npatients undergoing major abdominal surgery, measured\nby the length of hospital stay (LOS) compared with a\nstandard protocol based on conventional hemodynamic\ndata.\nMaterials and methods\nAfter obtaining written informed consent and Institu\ufffetional Review Board approval, 60 patients with an\nAmerican Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical\nstatus (Table 1) [20] of III with two or more risk factors\naccording to risk index of Lee (Table 2) [21] undergoing\nopen major abdominal surgery (intestine resection, gas\ufffetric resection, liver resection, esophageal resection,\nWhipple) were studied between 18 January 2008 and 16\nMarch 2009. Patients under 18 years, patients with\nsevere aortic regurgitation, permanent cardiac arrhyth\ufffemias, intra-aortic balloon pump and patients undergoing\nemergency surgery were excluded from the study.\nThe study was a single-centre, prospective randomized\ntrial carried out in a tertiary, university affiliated hospital.\nPatients were randomized preoperatively either into a\nstandard protocol group (control group) or an enhanced,\ngoal-directed hemodynamic monitoring group (GDT\ngroup) using a closed envelope system. Randomization\nwas performed by a member of the research team.\nIn both groups, premedication consisted of midazolam\n(0.01 mg kg-1), and standard general anesthesia was\ninduced with fentanyl 1 to 2 μg kg-1, propofol 1.5 to\n2 mg kg-1 and cisatracrurium 0.07 mg kg-1. After intu\ufffebation of the trachea, the lungs were ventilated to main\ufffetain normocapnia (end expiratory partial pressure of\ncarbon dioxide level 32 to 38 mmHg) using a constant\nfresh gas flow of 1 L min-1. Maintenance of anesthesia\nwas performed with 0.9 to 1.8% end tidal sevoflurane,\nand fentanyl and cisatracrurium boli were given as\nneeded. Standard monitoring for both groups included\nelectrocardiogram, invasive arterial blood pressure via\nright or left radial artery, CVP, pulse oximetry, tempera\ufffeture, inspiratory and expiratory gas concentrations.\nIn the control group, MAP was kept between 65 and 90\nmmHg, CVP between 8 and 12 mmHg and urinary out\ufffeput more than 0.5 mL kg-1 h-1. The GDT-group patients\nreceived enhanced hemodynamic monitoring with the\nFloTrac/Vigileo device (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA,\nUSA) and an attempted cardiac index (CI) of at least 2.5\nL·min-1·m-2. The arterial line was connected to the Vigi\ufffeleo monitor (software version 1.14; Edwards Lifesciences,\nIrvine, CA, USA) via the FloTrac pressure transducer and\nall intravascular pressure measurements were referenced\nto mid-axillary line level. The shape of the arterial curve\nwas checked visually for damping throughout the study\nperiod. CI, stroke volume index (SVI), as an indicator for\nfluid status, and stroke volume variation, (SVV) as an\nindicator for fluid responsiveness during mechanical ven\ufffetilation and sinus rhythm, were continuously measured.\nDetails of the protocols for both standard and enhanced\nhemodynamic monitoring are summarized in Figures 1\nand 2. Side effects of GDT (e.g. tachycardia during dobu\ufffetamine infusion) were not acceptable and as soon as they\ndeveloped further optimization attempts were ceased and\npatients were kept at the best possible level. Blood loss\nwas substituted with fluids according to the protocols\nand a hemoglobin value below 8 mg dL-1 was considered\nto be a trigger for transfusion of packed red blood cells.\nThe respective protocols in both groups were contin\ufffeued until the transportation monitoring equipment was\nattached to the patients, which happened after the end\nof surgery and hemodynamic stability. All patients were\nadmitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and both\ngroups were managed by the same physicians on the\nsame wards (ICU and general ward) who were not\ninvolved in the intraoperative management, data collec\ufffetion or group allocation of the study. Complications\nwere assessed daily by senior anesthesiologists and\nsenior surgeons blinded to group allocation and study\ndesign using standard predefined criteria. All data were\ncollected by a study nurse blinded to the study design\nand group allocation, except vital data, which were\nTable 1 The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)\nphysical status\nASA physical\nstatus\nDescription\nI A normal healthy patient\nII A patient with mild systemic disease\nIII A patient with severe systemic disease\nIV A patient with severe systemic disease that is a\nconstant threat to life\nV A moribund patient who is not expected to survive\nwithout the operation\nTable 2 The revised Lee cardiac risk index\n1.

These criteria were classified by spe\ufffecialist surgeons, who where not involved in the study\ndesign or group allocation.\nStatistical analysis\nThe primary outcome variable was the duration of hos\ufffepital stay. Secondary outcome variables were the inci\ufffedence of perioperative complications, the duration of\nthe ICU stay, the amount and type of fluids used intrao\ufffeperatively, and the amount and type of vasoactive and\npositive inotropic support used intraoperatively.\nA MedCalc 4.31 software package (MedCalc Software,\nMariakerke, Belgium) was used for statistical analyses.\nThe number of patients required in each group was\ndetermined before the study by a power calculation\nbased on the results of a similar previous study [1]. It\nwas found that the minimum clinically important differ\ufffeence we wished to detect was a 20% decrease in the pri\ufffemary endpoint duration of hospital stay. With an\nassumed a error of 0.05 (two-sided) and type II error of\n0.2, we found 24 patients per group to be required. To\ncompensate for possible dropouts, we decided to include\n30 patients per group.\nThe assumption of normality was checked using the\nKolmogorov-Smirnov test. Continuous, normally distrib\ufffeuted data were compared using paired and unpaired\nStudent’s t-test and a Bonferroni correction for repeated\nmeasurements was applied. Continuous, non-normally\ndistributed data were compared using the Wilcoxon\ntest. Binominal data were compared using chi-squared\nanalysis and Fisher’s exact test. All tests were two-sided\nand were performed at a corrected a = 0.05 level unless\notherwise specified.\nResults\nThe patient flow through the study is shown in Figure 3.\nBoth groups were comparable with respect to age, gen\ufffeder, weight, co-morbidities and the type of surgery as\ndetermined by the Lee classification scheme (Table 2)\nFigure 1 Enhanced hemodynamic monitoring protocol with FloTrac/Vigileo.

Anesthetic\nrequirements and duration of surgery also did not differ\nbetween the groups (Table 4). In the GDT group, we\nfound a reduced median (interquartile range) duration\nof hospital stay of 15 (12 to 17.75) days versus 19 (14 to\n23.5; P = 0.006; Figure 4) in the control group. The\nnumber of patients who developed complications was\nlower in the GDT group (6 patients, 20%) than in the\ncontrol group (15 patients, 50%; P = 0.03) and fewer\ncomplications per group were documented in the GDT\ngroup (17 complications) than in the control group (49\ncomplications; P = 0.001; Table 5). No difference was\nfound between the groups in the duration of ICU stay\n(39.6 ± 39.5 hours in the GDT group vs. 41.9 ± 43.5\nhours in the control group; P = 0.70) and postoperative\nmechanical ventilation (4.8 ± 4.5 hours in the GDT\ngroup vs. 7.8 ± 10.0 hours in the control group; P =\n0.14). Significantly more colloids were administered in\nthe GDT group (1188 ± 550 ml vs. 817 ± 467 ml; P =\n0.006), whereas the amount of crystalloid volume repla\ufffecement was lower (2489 ± 805 ml vs. 3153 ± 1264 ml;\nP = 0.02). The total amount of fluids administered\nFigure 2 Standard care protocol. MAP, mean arterial pressure; CVP, central venous pressure.\nMayer et al.

Positive\ninotropic support with dobutamine was higher in the\nGDT group (30.4 ± 50.5 μg kg-1 h-2 vs. 4.1 ± 19.0 μg\nkg-1h-2; P = 0.01). Administration of norepinephrine,\nepinephrine and nitrates was similar between the\ngroups. No difference was found with regard to urinary\noutput, loss of blood and blood transfusion. One patient\nin the GDT group did not achieve the predefined goals\nand optimization attempts were ceased because of\ntachyarrhythmia with a CI around 2.2 L·min-1·m-2. All\npatients of the control group achieved the predefined\ngoals. Two postoperative deaths occurred in each group.\nIn each group, one patient died secondary to anastomo\ufffetic leakage and sepsis. In one patient of the control\ngroup, myocardial infarction was diagnosed leading to\nfatal cardiogenic shock. One patient of the intervention\ngroup developed massive intraabdominal bleeding,\nwhich was fatal before emergency re-laparotomy could\nbe performed.\nTwo patients in each group were actually discharged\ntwo days later than possible because of social reasons.\nDiscussion\nIntraoperative GDT based on minimally invasive, flow\uffferelated parameters obtained by autocalibrated arterial\nwaveform analysis resulted in a significant reduction in\nFigure 3 Patient flow throughout the study.\nMayer et al.

Although these studies remained controversial,\nsubsequent work confirmed that goal-directed protocols\nfor perioperative management using flow-related para\ufffemeters improve patient outcome [1-3,5-8,25,26]. The\nunderlying mechanisms of the success of GDT are not\nyet entirely clear. Most authors assume that an oxygen\ndebt from decreased blood flow, hypoxia or hypovolemia\nmay cause mitochondrial damage and subsequent organ\ndysfunction [27]. Thus, adequate tissue oxygen supply\nseems to play a key role to prevent adverse patient out\ufffecome. Although blood flow to peripheral tissues is diffi\ufffecult to measure, tissue oxygen supply may be\napproximated using the DO2I. However, the DO2I needs\nto be calculated from information provided by repeated\nblood gas analyses. We therefore decided to use the CI\nas the target variable of the GDT protocol in this study,\nbecause this variable can be easily obtained and continu\ufffeously measured with the arterial waveform analysis\nmethod in a busy intraoperative setting. Together with\nadequate hemoglobin levels and arterial oxygen satura\ufffetion, we considered the CI as an adequate target for\nflow-based GDT.\nThe results of this study are in good agreement with\nprevious trials dealing with goal-directed hemodynamic\noptimization based on flow-related parameters, although\ntarget variables and methods to achieve the goals vary\nwidely in the literature. Lithium indicator dilution was\nused by Pearse and colleagues [1] to determine CO and\nDO2I in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.\nIn this study, patients in the intervention group were\noptimized postoperatively with colloids and dopexamine\nto achieve a DO2I of 600 ml min-1 m-2. A significant\nreduction in LOS from 29.5 days to 17.5 days and in the\nnumber of patients with complications (69% vs. 44%)\nwere found in comparison to a CVP-based protocol in a\nstandard care group. POSSUM score values and surgical\ninterventions were comparable with the present study,\nTable 5 Complications until hospital discharge\nComplication Diagnostic tools GDT\ngroup\nn = 30\nControl\ngroup\nn = 30\nInfection\nPneumonia Confirmed chest x-ray, WBC > 12 × 103 or < 4 × 103 ml-1 1 3\nAbdominal Abdominal CT 1 4\nUrinary tract Dysuria, urine analysis 0 0\nWound Clinical diagnosis 3 8\nRespiratory\nPulmonary embolism CTPA 0 0\nRespiratory support > 24 hours or weaning failure NIV > 24 hours, Re-intubation 2 3\nCardiovascular\nPulmonary edema Auscultation, chest x-ray 0 2\nArrhythmia ≥ Lown II, ≥ 30 atrial extrasystoles, AF, VF 2 3\nHypotension Mean arterial pressure ≤ 50 mmHg 2 9\nAcute myocardial infarction ECG signs for ischemia, troponin T ≥ 0.03 ng ml-1 0 2\nStroke Clinical diagnosis confirmed with CCT 0 1\nAbdominal\nBowel obstruction No defecation > 4 days 1 2\nUpper gastro-intestinal bleeding Clinical diagnosis, confirmed with endoscopy 1 0\nAnastomotic leak Drainage discharge, abdominal CT, WBC > 12 × 103 or < 4 × 103 ml-1 1 3\nRenal\nUrine output < 500 ml/day or required dialysis for\nacute renal failure\nClinical diagnosis 1 5\nPost-operative massive hemorrhage > 300 ml h-1 and/or need of re-operation 0 2\nPerioperative deaths 2 2\nTotal number of complications 17 49\nNumber (percentage) of patients with complications 6 (20%) 15 (50%)\nAF, atrial fibrillation; CCT, cranial computed tomography;CT, computed tomography; CTPA, computed tomography pulmonary angiogram; ECG, electrocardiogram;\nGDT, goal-directed therapy; NIV, non invasive ventilation; VF, ventricular flutter; WBC, white blood cell count.\nMayer et al.

The Lithium dilu\ufffetion cardiac output (LiDCO) method was used, which is\nconsidered more invasive and complicated than autocali\ufffebrated arterial waveform analysis because frequent man\ufffeual recalibrations are required [28] and an artificial\nindicator limits the number of calibrations per day [29].\nLopes and colleagues [25] analyzed the effects of intrao\ufffeperative optimization of pulse pressure variation (PPV).\nPPV was kept below 10% with colloid boluses in the\nintervention group and a significant reduction in LOS\n(from 17 to 7 days) and complications (75% of the\npatients vs. 41% of the patients) was found. In contrast\nto the present study, no protocol for the control group\nexisted and PPV was the only parameter to guide opti\ufffemization. Several previous studies used ED as the GDT,\nbut were mostly limited to fluid optimization [19,10,11].\nNoblett and colleagues [11] investigated the effects of\nED-guided intraoperative colloid fluid resuscitation in\npatients undergoing colorectal resection and found a\nreduced LOS (nine vs. six days) and a reduced compli\ufffecation rate. The median POSSUM scores, however, were\nlower in this study (explaining the shorter LOS), admin\ufffeistration of inotropes was not part of the optimization\nprotocol and no protocol for the standard care group\nexisted. The role of the ED method in goal-directed\nfluid therapy was investigated in a meta-analysis by\nAbbas and Hill [26] and an overall reduction of LOS\nand lower complication rates were found in the GDT\ngroups of five studies, although absolute CO measure\ufffements were found to be imprecise [12].\nIn the present study, the amount of colloids adminis\ufffetered in the GDT group was significantly higher and the\namount of crystalloids was lower, which could have\nbeen protocol dependant. However, this finding is con\ufffesistent with findings in other GDT literature, where a\ntrend towards a more generous administration of col\ufffeloids instead of crystalloids can be seen [1,2,25,30] and\nmay be most likely a result of an earlier detection of\nfluid demand with enhanced hemodynamic monitoring.\nKimberger and colleagues [31] recently investigated the\ninfluence of different volume regimens on tissue perfu\ufffesion in an animal model and found a significantly\nincreased microcirculatory blood flow and tissue oxygen\ntension with goal-directed administration of colloids.\nThe ongoing discussion about the ‘optimal’ amount and\ntype of fluid can at least partially be resolved, as evi\ufffedence grows that individually titrated, goal-directed\nadministration of primarily colloid solutions improves\npatient outcome in patients undergoing major abdom\ufffeinal surgery [2,25,32].\nPermanent cardiac arrhythmias are a problem that\naffects almost all methods to determine flow-based\nhemodynamic variables, in particular those using the\narterial waveform as source of information. The preci\ufffesion becomes less accurate and determination of SVV is\nnot possible. Although temporary, short arrhythmic epi\ufffesodes can be eliminated by the algorithm of the Vigileo\ndevice, episodes shorter than five minutes were elimi\ufffenated by ceasing measurements during this time. We\nalso had to exclude patients with permanent cardiac\narrhythmias, which might be a limitation of this study.\nIt has also been found that the bolus administration of\nvasoactive drugs may affect accuracy of the arterial\nwaveform-based method [33]. However, bolus adminis\ufffetration was rarely necessary and measurements were dis\ufffecontinued during this period. Furthermore, the study is\nunderpowered to analyze mortality and patient follow\ufffeup was performed until hospital discharge only.\nConclusions\nThe results of this study demonstrated that an optimiza\ufffetion protocol based on flow-related hemodynamic para\ufffemeters obtained with the minimally invasive FloTrac/\nVigileo device reduced the duration of hospital stay and\nperioperative complications in high-risk patients under\ufffegoing major abdominal surgery.\nKey messages\n• Intraoperative GDT using a protocol based on\nenhanced hemodynamic variables derived by the Flo\ufffeTrac/Vigileo device reduced the LOS in high-risk\npatients undergoing major abdominal surgery com\ufffepared with a standard management protocol.\n• The incidence of complications was reduced in the\nenhanced monitoring group.\n• No difference between the standard and enhanced\nmonitoring protocol groups was found with regard\nto ICU stay.\nAbbreviations\nASA: American Society of Anesthesiology; CI: cardiac index; CO: cardiac\noutput; CVP: central venous pressure; DO2I: oxygen delivery index; ED:\nesophagus Doppler; GDT: goal-directed therapy; ICU: intensive care unit;\nLiDCO: lithium dilution cardiac output; LOS: length of hospital stay; MAP:\nmean arterial pressure; PAC: pulmonary artery catheter; POSSUM:\nphysiological and operative severity score for the enumeration of mortality\nand morbidity; PPV: pulse pressure variation; SVI: stroke volume index; SVV:\nstroke volume variation.\nAcknowledgements\nThis study was funded by an unrestricted grant by Edwards Lifesciences,\nIrvine, CA, USA.

The study compares two groups: one receiving standard care and another receiving enhanced hemodynamic monitoring with FloTrac/Vigileo devices. The primary endpoint is the duration of hospital stay, while secondary outcomes include complications, length of ICU stay, fluid balance, and use of vasoactive agents. The study finds that the enhanced monitoring group has a significant reduction in hospital stay, as well as fewer complications and higher fluid administration. The study suggests that goal-directed intraoperative therapy based on autocalibrated arterial pressure waveform analysis could potentially reduce hospital stays for high-risk surgical patients.",1.0,0.8184237644879492,FULL_PAPER

NMP is fre\ufffequently performed by using human blood products including red blood cells (RBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Our\naim was to examine the efficacy of a novel machine perfusion solution based on polymerized bovine hemoglobin-based\noxygen carrier (HBOC)-201. Twenty-four livers declined for transplantation were transported by using static cold storage.\nUpon arrival, livers underwent NMP for 6 hours using pressure-controlled portal and arterial perfusion. A total of 12 liv\ufffeers were perfused using a solution based on RBCs and FFPs (historical cohort), 6 livers with HBOC-201 and FFPs, and\nanother 6 livers with HBOC-201 and gelofusine, a gelatin-based colloid solution. Compared with RBC 1 FFP perfused\nlivers, livers perfused with HBOC-201 had significantly higher hepatic adenosine triphosphate content, cumulative bile\nproduction, and portal and arterial flows. Biliary secretion of bicarbonate, bilirubin, bile salts, and phospholipids was simi\ufffelar in all 3 groups. The alanine aminotransferase concentration in perfusate was lower in the HBOC-201–perfused groups.\nIn conclusion, NMP of human donor livers can be performed effectively using HBOC-201 and gelofusine, eliminating\nthe need for human blood products. Perfusing livers with HBOC-201 is at least similar to perfusion with RBCs and FFP.\nSome of the biomarkers of liver function and injury even suggest a possible superiority of an HBOC-201–based perfusion\nsolution and opens a perspective for further optimization of machine perfusion techniques.\nLiver Transplantation 24 528–538 2018 AASLD.\nReceived September 23, 2017; accepted December 18, 2017.\nSEE EDITORIAL ON PAGE 462\nLiver transplantation is the only curative treatment\noption for end-stage liver disease. Unfortunately, a\nglobal discrepancy exists between the availability and\nneed for human donor livers, resulting in substantial\nwait-list mortality.(1) Over the past decades, machine\nperfusion has been gaining interest as a promising tool\nfor expanding the human donor liver pool.(2)\nNormothermic machine perfusion (NMP) is a tech\ufffenique whereby human donor livers are perfused ex situ\nat 378C. This technique can be used for the entire period\nof preservation, as is currently being evaluated in a clini\ufffecal trial by Friend et al. in Oxford,(3) and for viability\nassessment of the organ prior to transplantation.(4-6) In\nthis manner, only well-functioning organs are trans\ufffeplanted, including those that initially may have been\ndeclined for transplantation. Furthermore, NMP has the\npotential to allow for the resuscitation of donor livers.\nNMP is generally performed using a perfusion solu\ufffetion based on packed red blood cells (RBCs).(3,7-9) The\nNMP solution requires an adequate oxygen carrier to\ndeliver oxygen throughout the organ, as well as physio\ufffelogical osmolarity and oncotic pressure. Previous NMP\nperfusions at our center were performed using matched\npacked RBCs and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) obtained\nfrom the blood bank, with the addition of nutrients and\nAbbreviations: ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate ami\ufffenotransferase; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; BMI, body mass index;\nCVA, cerebrovascular accident; CV, central vein; DBD, donation\nafter brain death; DCD, donation after circulatory death; ELISA,\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FFP, fresh frozen plasma;\nGGT, gamma-glutamyltransferase; Hb, hemoglobin; HBOC, hemo\ufffeglobin-based oxygen carrier; H & E, hematoxylin-eosin; HTK, histi\ufffedine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate; IQR, interquartile range; metHb,\nmethemoglobin; NMP, normothermic machine perfusion; PCO2, par\ufffetial pressure of carbon dioxide; PO2, partial pressure of oxygen; PT,\nportal triad; RBC, red blood cell; SO2, oxygen saturation; TBB,\nanti-tublin beta; UW, University of Wisconsin.\n528 | ORIGINAL ARTICLE\nORIGINAL ARTICLE MATTON ET AL.\n\nantibiotics.(7) Other centers have performed NMP with\nRBCs and gelofusine(3,8) or Steen solution,(9) and 1 pre\ufffevious study has also performed hemoglobin-based oxy\ufffegen carrier (HBOC)-201 and gelofusine.(10)\nThe use of human blood products is expensive and\nlogistically challenging due to their short preservation\ntime and need for matching. Furthermore, human\nblood products are scarce and carry the risk of transmit\ufffeting blood borne infections. For these ethical, financial,\nand logistical reasons it would be favorable to avoid the\nuse of RBCs and FFPs for NMP. Consequently, the\naim of the current study was to design a perfusion solu\ufffetion for NMP that circumvents the use of human blood\nproducts. We did this by replacing RBCs with HBOC\ufffe201 (Hemopure, HbO2 Therapeutics LLC, Souderton,\nPA), a bovine-derived free hemoglobin (Hb) oxygen\ncarrier, and FFPs with gelofusine, a widely used com\ufffemercially available colloid solution.\nPatients and Methods\nORGAN PROCUREMENT\nThe present study was performed at the University Medi\ufffecal Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands, and\nwas approved by the medical ethical committee of the\ninstitute. Between July 2012 and July 2015, 24 human\ndonor livers that were declined for transplantation were\nincluded after consent for research had been obtained from\nrelatives. All donor livers were procured using the standard\ntechnique of in situ cooling and flush out with ice-cold\npreservation solution (University of Wisconsin [UW] or\nhistidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate [HTK] solution, in line\nwith the national organ procurement protocol), as has pre\ufffeviously been described.(11) Livers were packed in ice-cold\npreservation solution (UW or HTK), stored on ice, and\ntransported to our center. Upon arrival, an experienced\nliver surgeon performed the back-table preparation and\ncannulated the portal vein, supratruncal aorta, and bile\nduct for machine perfusion. Meanwhile, the machine per\ufffefusion device was set up and primed, and machine perfu\ufffesion was commenced as soon as possible.\nSTUDY GROUPS\nTwelve donor livers were perfused with RBCs and FFPs\n(RBC 1 FFP group). Subsequently, 6 livers were per\ufffefused with HBOC-201 and FFPs (HBOC-201 1 FFP\ngroup), and thereafter, 6 livers were perfused with\nHBOC-201 and gelofusine (HBOC-201 1 gelofusine\ngroup). Because of the scarcity of available donor livers at\nour research center, we used a cohort of livers that had\nalready been perfused and previously published (RBC 1\nFFP group).(11) Perfusions in the 3 study groups were not\nrandomized but instead performed consecutively. All per\ufffefusions were performed in the presence of the principal\ninvestigator, and after having optimized our perfusion\ntechnique extensively before including any of the liver\ngrafts of the present study, no changes were made in per\ufffefusion technique.\nOXYGEN CARRIER HBOC-201\nThe HBOC-201 oxygen carrier solution contains\npolymerized Hb, which is much smaller than a human\nerythrocyte, is less viscous than RBCs, and has the\nability to release oxygen more easily than human\nHb.(12) This gives it the ability to perfuse tissues more\ndeeply and oxygenate more remote regions.(12) Because\nof the extraction and purification process, potential\ncontaminants including plasma proteins, endotoxins,\nbacteria, viruses, and the prions responsible for bovine\nspongiform encephalopathy and variant Creutzfeld\ufffeJakob disease are removed, resulting in a sterile,\npyrogen-free solution.(13) The in vivo half-life of\nHBOC-201 is approximately 20 hours.(13) A downside\nto the use of HBOC-201 is the potential formation of\nmethemoglobin (metHb). However, the small amount\nAddress reprint requests to Robert J.

An oxygen carrier, provided by either 3 units of\nRBCs or 4 units of HBOC-201 (Hemopure, HbO2\nTherapeutics LLC), both with a total of 120 g Hb.\n2. A colloid solution, consisting of either 3 units of\nFFP supplemented with 100 mL 20% human albu\ufffemin or 500 mL 4% gelofusine (B Braun, Melsun\ufffegen, Germany) supplemented with 250 mL 20%\nhuman albumin.\n3. Additional supplements containing nutrients, trace\nelements, antibiotics, vitamins, insulin, and hepa\uffferin as described previously.(7)\nThe total volume of perfusion solution was similar\nin all 3 groups and approximately 2200 mL. All blood\nproducts were supplied by Sanquin, the Dutch blood\nbank, and were not expired. In each perfusion solution,\nthe colloid oncotic pressure and osmolarity were tar\ufffegeted to reach physiological levels. Prior to connecting\nthe liver, the pH of the perfusion fluid was optimized.\nNORMOTHERMIC MACHINE\nPERFUSION\nThe Liver Assist (Organ Assist, Groningen, the Nether\ufffelands) machine perfusion device was used. It simulates\nthe physiological environment by providing pressure\ufffecontrolled pulsatile flow to the hepatic artery and continu\ufffeous flow to the portal vein and gravitational outflow\nthrough the vena cava. The hepatic artery and portal vein\nperfusion circuits are each composed of a rotary perfusion\npump, a membrane oxygenator with integrated heat\nexchanger, and flow and pressure sensors.\nThe perfusion solution was maintained at 378C,\nand NMP was performed for 6 hours. Pressures were\nset at a mean of 70 mm Hg (systolic and diastolic\npressures 620%) on the arterial and 11 mm Hg on the\nportal side. Perfusion fluid was oxygenated using a total\nof 4 L/minute (95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide)\nthrough the 2 oxygenators. Before NMP and every 30\nminutes during NMP, samples of the arterial and\nvenous perfusion fluid, as well as bile samples, were\ntaken for analysis of blood gas parameters (pH, partial\npressure of oxygen [PO2], partial pressure of carbon\ndioxide [PCO2], oxygen saturation [SO2], bicarbonate\n[HCO3\n2] lactate, glucose, and metHb) using an\nABL800 FLEX or ABL90 FLEX analyzer (Radio\ufffemeter, Brønhøj, Denmark). If needed, sodium bicarbon\ufffeate (8.4% solution) was added to maintain a pH within\nthe physiological range of 7.35-7.45, as described previ\ufffeously.(7,15) Liver parenchyma wedge biopsies were taken\nbefore and every 2 hours during NMP. Biopsies were\nstored in formalin and embedded in paraffin, or snap\ufffefrozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 2808C. Bile pro\ufffeduced by the liver was collected and measured every 30\nminutes and stored at 2808C. Perfusion fluid samples\nwere collected every half hour and stored at 2808C\n(after 5 minutes centrifugation at 2700 rpm at 48C).\nASSESSMENT OF HEPATOBILIARY\nFUNCTION AND INJURY\nAdenosine triphosphate (ATP) in liver parenchyma\nbiopsies was determined as described previously.(4)\nTo calculate the peak oxygen extraction, the differ\ufffeence between arterial and venous oxygen content was\ncalculated and corrected for the flow. The following\nformula was used to calculate the oxygen content:\nOxygen content 5 (PO2 3 K) 1 (SO2 3 Hb 3 c),\nwhere PO2 is the partial pressure of oxygen in kPa, K is a\nconstant (0.0225), SO2 is the oxygen saturation expressed\nas a fraction (where 1.00 is 100% saturation), Hb is the\nconcentration in g/dL, and c is the oxygen binding capac\ufffeity of Hb (1.39 for human Hb; 1.26 for HBOC-201).\nTotal bilirubin concentration in bile was determined\nusing a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay (ELISA) kit (Human Total Bilirubin ELISA\nkit, #MBS756198, MyBioSource, Inc., San Diego,\nCA) using a monoclonal anti-tublin beta (TBB) anti\ufffebody and a TBB-HRP conjugate as indicated by the\nmanufacturer.

Color\nintensity was measured spectrophotometrically at a\nwavelength of 570 nm (VersaMax Molecular devices) in\nSoftMax Pro 5.4 and concentrations were calculated. In\norder to calculate the biliary secretion of bicarbonate,\nbilirubin, total bile salts, and phospholipids, their con\ufffecentrations were multiplied by the volume of bile pro\ufffeduced, corrected for the weight of the liver.\nAfter centrifugation, perfusate samples were diluted\n103 and analyzed for alanine aminotransferase (ALT)\nusing routine diagnostic laboratory procedures. Be\ufffecause HBOC-201 Hb is freely suspended in solution\nand cannot be spun down, ALT concentrations in\nthe HBOC-201 groups were corrected for the 20%\nhematocrit present in the RBC 1 FFP group by mul\ufffetiplying ALT values in the HBOC-201 groups by\n1.25 (1/0.80 5 1.25).\nParaffin-embedded slides of liver biopsies were pre\ufffepared for hematoxylin-eosin (H & E) staining and\nsemiquantitatively assessed using the Suzuki liver\ninjury scoring system.(17) All liver slides were examined\nin a blinded fashion by an expert liver pathologist\n(A.S.H.G.).\nSTATISTICS\nContinuous variables are presented as median with\ninterquartile range (IQR); categorical variables are pre\ufffesented as absolute numbers. Continuous variables were\ncompared between groups by calculating the area under\nthe curve when indicated and the Kruskal-Wallis H or\nMann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction. Cat\ufffeegorical variables were compared with the Fisher’s exact\ntest.

There were no significant differences in\ndonor liver characteristics between the groups. Nota\ufffebly, the number of livers discarded due to expected\nsteatosis (based on donor body mass index [BMI],\nultrasound, and laboratory results) was 5 in the RBC\n1 FFP group compared with 0 and 1 in the HBOC\ufffe201 1 FFP and HBOC-201 1 gelofusine groups,\nrespectively. However, the level of actual microscopic\nsteatosis, which was only known after the liver had\nbeen offered for research, was much lower. Only 2\n(17%) livers in the HBOC-201 1 FFP group, 0 in the\nHBOC-201 1 FFP group, and 1 (17%) in the\nHBOC-201 1 gelofusine group had a clinically rele\ufffevant degree of microscopic steatosis (>30%).\nNORMOTHERMIC MACHINE\nPERFUSION\nFigure 1 shows photographs of NMP using RBC 1\nFFP (Fig. 1A) and HBOC-201 1 gelofusine (Fig.\n1B). The color of HBOC-201 is darker than that of\nhuman blood. During 1 HBOC-201 1 FFP perfu\ufffesion, there was blood present in the bile and this liver\nwas consequently excluded for biliary analyses, as this\nwould result in the recording of falsely elevated bile\nproduction. The fraction of metHb during NMP\nreached maximally 0.02% in the RBC 1 FFP group,\n0.22% in the HBOC-201 1 FFP group, and 0.28% in\nthe HBOC-201 1 gelofusine group (healthy human\nadults range <1%).\nHEMODYNAMICS\nAs shown in Fig. 2A, the portal vein flow increased dur\ufffeing the first hour of NMP and thereafter remained sta\ufffeble in all 3 groups. In both HBOC-201 groups, the\nportal flow was significantly higher at each time point\ncompared with the RBC 1 FFP group, reaching a\nmedian (IQR) of 848 (663-1393) mL/minute/kg liver\nweight in the RBC 1 FFP group, 1890 (1530-2173) in\nthe HBOC-201 1 FFP group, and 1830 (1713-2030)\nin the HBOC-201 1 gelofusine group at 6 hours of\nNMP.\nThe hepatic artery flow was higher after the first 2\nhours of NMP in both HBOC-201 groups compared\nwith the RBC 1 FFP group, reaching a median (IQR)\nof 273 (231-327) mL/minute/kg liver weight in the\nRBC 1 FFP group, 742 (480-867) mL/minute/kg\nliver weight in the HBOC-201 1 FFP group, and 533\n(187-741) mL/minute/kg liver weight in the HBOC\ufffe201 1 gelofusine group at 6 hours NMP.

In this study, we have shown the following:\n1. NMP can be effectively performed without the use\nof human blood products by replacing RBCs with\nHBOC-201, a polymerized bovine Hb, and FFPs\nby gelofusine, a widely available colloid solution.\n2. That perfusion with HBOC-201 is at least as\neffective as with RBCs.\nSome end points in our study indicate that an\nHBOC-201–based perfusion fluid may even be superior,\nas shown by the increased recovery of hepatic ATP con\ufffetent, bile production, and improved glucose and lactate\nmetabolism, as well as lower injury markers (ALT).\nAfter having performed perfusions with RBCs and\nFFPs, we first replaced RBCs with HBOC-201 and\nkept FFPs, and subsequently also replaced FFPs with\ngelofusine. The ATP content in liver parenchyma was\ncontinuously higher in both HBOC-201 groups\ncompared with the RBC 1 FFPs group. Previous\nresearch has shown that during static cold storage,\nhepatic ATP levels are depleted and that these levels\ncan be restored during machine perfusion.(11,18) Livers\nwith higher ATP levels show significantly better out\ufffecomes after transplantation, as has been validated in\nseveral animal and clinical studies,(19-21) holding\ngreat promise for future clinical perfusion with\nHBOC-201.\nA possible explanation for the higher ATP content\nin liver parenchyma in the HBOC-201–perfused livers\nlies in the properties of HBOC-201. The HBOC-201\nmolecule has a lower affinity for oxygen than human\nHb with a dissociation curve that is shifted to the right,\ncausing HBOC-201 to give off oxygen more read\ufffeily.(12) In addition, HBOC-201 solution is less viscous\nand contains free Hb, which is much smaller than\nerythrocytes, thereby allowing it to penetrate more\ndeeply into the tissue.(12) The peak oxygen extraction\n \nFIG. 6.

In line\nwith this, the cumulative bile production was also signifi\ufffecantly higher in both HBOC-201 groups compared with\nthe RBC 1 FFP group. According to the “viability\ncriteria” described by Sutton et al., 7 out of 12 livers in\nthe RBC 1 FFP group, 4 out of 5 in the HBOC-201 1\nFFP group, and 6 out of 6 livers in the HBOC-201 1\ngelofusine group would have potentially been transplant\ufffeable.(4) Similarly, bile production is a transplantation cri\ufffeterion established in a clinically validated group of livers\ndescribed by the Birmingham group.(22)\nThe amount of bicarbonate, bile salts, phospholi\ufffepids, and bilirubin secreted into bile was, however, not\nsignificantly different between the 3 groups. Bile flow\nis mainly driven by the secretion of bile salts, but a sig\ufffenificant part is also driven by bile salt–independent fac\ufffetors.(23) It could be possible that the secretion of other\nmolecules, such as HBOC-201 or derivatives thereof,\nare hypercholeretic and thereby cause higher bile flow\nwith an altered bile composition.\nBoth the lactate and glucose concentrations in perfu\ufffesion fluid declined more rapidly in the HBOC-201–\nperfused livers compared with the RBC 1 FFP–per\ufffefused livers, though this did not reach significance. This\nmay indicate that the HBOC-201–perfused livers were\nable to metabolize lactate and glucose at least equally\nwell, or perhaps even better, as the RBC-perfused livers,\nreflecting proper restoration of aerobic metabolism.\nThe HBOC-201–perfused livers consistently showed\nsignificantly higher flows through the portal vein com\ufffepared with the RBC 1 FFP–perfused livers. Flow\nthrough the hepatic artery was also consistently higher\nin the HBOC-201–perfused groups, reaching signifi\ufffecance between the RBC 1 FFP and HBOC-201 1\ngelofusine groups. The increased flow is likely a result of\nthe aforementioned lower viscosity of HBOC-201,\ncompared with human blood and not caused by a differ\ufffeence in intrahepatic resistance between the groups. The\nsize of HBOC-201 is 1 3 10-8 the size of an RBC.\nThis makes an HBOC-201–based perfusion fluid much\nless viscous than an RBC-based fluid, resulting in\nhigher flows at a given intrahepatic resistance.\nInterestingly, the concentration of the liver injury\nmarker, ALT, in perfusion fluid was consistently lower\nin the HBOC-201 groups compared with the RBC 1\nFFP group, despite no histological differences in the\namount of liver parenchyma injury. There were no sig\ufffenificant differences in donor parameters between the 3\ngroups; in fact, the DRI was even slightly higher in the\nHBOC-201 1 gelofusine group. The number of livers\ndeclined for transplantation due to expected steatosis\nwas higher in the RBC 1 FFP group. However, this\ndid not translate into a higher number of livers with\nmicroscopically confirmed clinically relevant steatosis\nand is therefore unlikely to have played a major role in\nthe results of the present study.\nTwo other studies have reported the use of HBOC\ufffe201 in a machine perfusion setting. In the first study,\nsubnormothermic (218C) machine perfusion was com\ufffepared with static cold storage using pig donor livers.\nThe investigators noted significantly higher survival,\nsuperior graft function, and bile production after liver\ntransplantation in the machine-perfused group com\ufffepared with static cold-stored livers.(24) The second\nstudy compared NMP using RBCs with HBOC-201\nand reported similar flows, lactate clearance, and histo\ufffelogical findings. They also reported significantly higher\noxygen extraction in the HBOC-201–perfused\ngroup.(10) The results of these studies are in line with\nthe results of our study and indicate that machine per\ufffefusion with HBOC-201 is equal or even superior for\nthe function and quality of liver grafts.\nLimitations of this study are relatively small sample\nsizes in the HBOC-201 study groups, lack of trans\ufffeplant validation, and perfusions in the 3 study groups\nwere performed consecutively rather than after ran\ufffedomization. We do not, however, believe that a poten\ufffetial learning curve could have played a role in the\ncurrent study as our research team had extensively opti\ufffemized its NMP technique prior to the perfusion of any\nof the included liver grafts, after which no changes in\nperfusion technique were made.\nIn conclusion, NMP can be performed without the\nuse of RBCs and FFPs by replacing them with HBOC\ufffe201 and gelofusine, respectively. This reduces the costs\nand logistical complexity of NMP and avoids the use of\nscarce human blood products, which carry the potential\nto transmit blood-borne infections. The current study\nindicates that perfusing livers with HBOC-201 is at\nleast similar to perfusion with human RBC. Some of\nthe biomarkers of liver function and injury used in this\nstudy even suggest a possible superiority of an HBOC\ufffebased perfusion solution. Altogether, this suggests that\nNMP with HBOC-201 and gelofusine is a favorable\nmethod and opens a perspective for further optimization\nof machine perfusion techniques. Future studies are\nneeded to assess the safety of performing NMP with\nHBOC-201 and gelofusine in a clinical transplantation\nsetting.

This approach reduces liver \nmetabolic activity, allowing safe storage for up to 12–18h (refs. 1,2\n). \nRecently, the combination of supercooling with subzero storage \n(−4 °C) and hypothermic, as well as subnormothermic, machine \nperfusion achieved an extension of the preservation time of human \nlivers up to 27h (ref. 2\n). By contrast, human livers can also be kept \nmetabolically fully active for up to 24h by supplying normothermic \nblood or oxygenated fluids in a controlled environment by machine \nperfusion1,3–5\n. The possibility of repairing poor-quality livers suffi\ufffeciently to enable transplantation requires preserving metabolically \nactive livers1,3\n for several days. Accordingly, the need for long-term \norgan preservation technology has been endorsed by multiple pri\ufffevate and governmental initiatives1\n. However, currently used normo\ufffethermic machine perfusion technologies have been used only for a \nrelatively short time period (for example, a median perfusion time \nof 9h (ref. 5\n)), to successfully maintain hemodynamics, perfusate \noxygenation and temperature.\nWe sought to extend perfusion time beyond 24h by engineer\ufffeing a perfusion machine that recapitulates additional core body \nfunctions that are critical to liver health. We chose 7-d as a target \nbecause this time period has been shown to offer a credible time \nframe for inducing clinically relevant liver regeneration in patients \nundergoing complex liver resection6–8\n. Under physiologic condi\ufffetions, the liver, which constitutes 2.5% of body weight, receives \n25% of the blood output of the heart and performs >5,000 func\ufffetions9\n. It has a unique dual vascular supply with high-pressure, \noxygen-rich arterial blood entering through the hepatic artery and \nlow-pressure, oxygen-reduced portal vein blood draining the \nabdominal viscera. Its high metabolic activity produces waste \nproducts that are excreted in the bile or removed by hepatic mac\uffferophages or the kidneys. The metabolic profile is largely controlled \nby pancreatic hormones, including insulin and glucagon. Our per\ufffefusion technology, developed in the “Liver4Life project”, includes \nautomated control of glucose levels by injection of insulin and glu\ufffecagon, a dialysis membrane for waste-product removal, regulation \nof oxygenation and liver movement to prevent pressure necrosis.\nResults\nLiver perfusion machine. Our perfusion machine (Fig. 1a,b) reca\ufffepitulates blood supply through the two vascular entries of the liver, \nthe hepatic artery and portal vein. The hepatic artery is supplied \nwith oxygen-rich blood at elevated pressure (mean arterial pressure \n(MAP)≥65mmHg) in a pulsatile manner (Fig. 1c), whereas the por\ufffetal vein receives blood at low pressure (around 5–10mmHg) with a \nreduced oxygen content (venous blood, non-pulsatile). The system \nmaintains oxygen saturation of 65% in the vena cava by continu\ufffeously adjusting oxygen content in the portal vein (Fig. 1d). In\xa0vivo, \nnutrients and bile salts are transported from the intestine to the liver \nvia the portal vein. To recapitulate this, we inject parenteral nutri\ufffetion and ursodeoxycholic acid into the portal vein line of our perfu\ufffesion machine. Hepatic artery hemodynamics are tightly controlled \nby automated infusion of vasoconstrictors and vasodilators (Fig. 1e) \ninto the hepatic artery line. The pressure in the vena cava is con\ufffetinuously kept at physiological levels close to 0mmHg (0–2mmHg) \nto prevent liver congestion. An oxygenator provides oxygen to the \nhepatic artery and to the portal vein while removing CO2 from \nAn integrated perfusion machine preserves \ninjured human livers for 1 week\nDilmurodjon Eshmuminov\u200a 1,2,6, Dustin Becker2,3,6, Lucia Bautista Borrego\u200a 1,2, Max Hefti\u200a 2,3, \nMartin J.

Current approaches for normothermic perfusion can preserve human livers for only \n24\u2009h. Here we report a liver perfusion machine that integrates multiple core physiological functions, including automated man\ufffeagement of glucose levels and oxygenation, waste-product removal and hematocrit control. We developed the machine in a \nstepwise fashion using pig livers. Study of multiple ex vivo parameters and early phase reperfusion in\xa0vivo demonstrated the \nviability of pig livers perfused for 1 week without the need for additional blood products or perfusate exchange. We tested the \napproach on ten injured human livers that had been declined for transplantation by all European centers. After a 7-d perfusion, \nsix of the human livers showed preserved function as indicated by bile production, synthesis of coagulation factors, maintained \ncellular energy (ATP) and intact liver structure.\nNature Biotechnology | VOL 38 | February 2020 | 189–198 | www.nature.com/naturebiotechnology 189\n\nArticles Nature Biotechnology\nthe perfusate. The oxygen tension in the hepatic artery is continu\ufffeously monitored and controlled to remain in predefined bounds, \nthat is, 10–12 kPa. The CO2 tension is adapted via the oxygenator to \nmaintain blood pH between 7.25 and 7.45 (Supplementary \nFig. 1). We incorporated an integrated dialysis unit for physiologic \nelectrolyte balance and removal of metabolic waste products from \nthe blood.\nWe used an algorithm to automatically adjust the dialysate flow, \ncontrolling the concentration of red blood cells (hematocrit) on \nthe basis of continuous measurements (Fig. 1f). Automated insulin \n(Fig. 1g) and glucagon administration was used to maintain physi\ufffeological blood glucose levels (targeted range of 3.5–6.5mmoll\n−1\n) in \nresponse to continuous glucose measurements. Continuous move\ufffement of the liver, in an effort to mimic diaphragm oscillations, is \nalso integrated into the system (Supplementary Fig. 1). The perfu\ufffesion machine is fully automated obviating the need for constant \npresence of personnel. Features of the described long-term perfu\ufffesion technology as compared to the commercially available perfu\ufffesion machines are summarized in Fig. 1h.\nThrough early experiments using pig livers we identified five \nmajor hurdles, each limiting successful long-term liver preservation \nwith blood-based perfusate, namely, control of glucose metabolism, \nprevention of hemolysis, removal of waste products, control of per\ufffefusate oxygenation and simulation of diaphragm movement (Fig. 2). \nThese obstacles were studied and overcome through incremental \nsteps using 70 healthy pig livers, before initiating the human study.\nGlucose metabolism. We first perfused pig livers with a hyper\ufffeglycemic perfusate (perfusate glucose >10mmoll\n−1\n) at fixed \ninsulin injection rates (0.9Uh−1\n). Although glucose is not the pri\ufffemary energy source for hepatocytes10, perfusion protocols avail\ufffeable in the literature4,5,11,12 have used this approach. For example, \nthe pioneering randomized controlled trial of normothermic liver \nperfusion in humans also reported high glucose levels in the per\ufffefusate (>10mmoll\n−1\n) at a constant insulin injection rate (7Uh−1\n)5\n. \nHowever, using this approach, we observed high insulin concentra\ufffetions in the perfusate (229±72pmoll\n−1\n), which led to activation of \nglycogen synthase and excessive glycogen deposition in liver tissue, \nsimilar to what is seen in glycogen-storage diseases (Fig. 2a,c and \nSupplementary Fig. 2).\nIn the next series of experiments, we reduced glucose levels in \nthe perfusate to 4mmoll\n−1\n by manually adjusting the glucose infu\ufffesion rate resulting in considerable reduction of glycogen deposition \n(Fig. 2a). The persistence of high levels of insulin (0.9Uh−1\n), how\ufffeever, resulted in activation of glucose uptake by hepatocytes and \ndeprivation of glucose for erythrocytes in the perfusate (erythro\ufffecytes rely only on glucose as an energy source owing to their lack \nof mitochondria), implying failure of manual control (Fig. 2b and \nSupplementary Fig. 2). Therefore, we included a device with auto\ufffemated monitoring of glucose levels in the perfusate using a continu\ufffeous online sensor (Figs. 1g and 2a,c, and Supplementary Fig. 2). We \nimplemented closed-loop control of glucose levels by automatically \ninjecting insulin and glucagon (Supplementary Fig. 1).\nMinimizing hemolysis. Hemolysis is a common shortcoming in \nliver perfusion systems using blood-based perfusates owing to expo\ufffesure to foreign surfaces and non-pulsatile perfusion of the hepatic \nartery. Elevated hemolysis with a non-pulsatile pump is potentially \nexplained by sludge and erythrocyte stasis, which is prevented with \npulsatile perfusion13–16.\nTo decrease hemolysis in our system, we opted for a perfusion \nloop design with only one pump head and one oxygenator despite \nhaving a dual perfusion route. Pulsatile flow in the hepatic artery \nwas generated by varying the rotational speed of the centrifugal \npump head with a targeted MAP of 65mmHg and 60 beats per \nminute creating a pulse waveform that mimicked the in\xa0vivo set\ufffeting (Fig. 1c). Pulsatile flow caused a significantly lower degree of \nhemolysis (0.2±0.1 g l\n−1\n versus 0.7±0.2 g l\n−1\n; P<0.001) after 24h of \nperfusion (Fig. 2d) as compared to non-pulsatile flow.\nElectrolyte control. We observed elevated sodium levels (hyperna\ufffetremia) during liver perfusion, reaching levels of up to 200mmoll\n−1\n, \nwhich has detrimental effects on organ viability. Serum sodium \nconcentrations of >165mmoll\n−1\n in liver donors is considered an \nextended criterion, which was observed in a human liver perfu\ufffesion without an integrated dialysis system5,17. To prevent hyperna\ufffetremia, we integrated a dialysis membrane in the perfusion loop, \nperforming critical excretory kidney functions (Figs. 1f and 2e). \nAn additional effect of dialysis was the automated modulation of \na transmembrane flow (TMF) of dialysate across the dialysis fil\ufffeter membrane, which allows the control of the hematocrit level \n(Fig. 2f). These refinements enabled us to run perfusion for 7-d \nwithout the need for exchanging the perfusate or using any addi\ufffetional blood products. In addition, dialysis also removed metabolic \nwaste products, such as blood urea nitrogen (BUN; Fig. 2g).\nPhysiologic venous oxygen saturation in the portal vein. Despite \nthe uniform delivery of highly oxygenized blood through the \nhepatic artery, most reported liver perfusion systems provide \nnon-physiologic arterial blood also through the portal vein4,5,11,12. \nHowever, in our preliminary experiments we found that hyperoxy\ufffegenation in the portal vein was associated with the need for high \namounts of vasodilators (285±162milliliter per week) to maintain \na physiologic flow in the hepatic artery (Fig. 2h,i); a finding consis\ufffetent with other reports indicating enhanced arterial vasoconstric\ufffetion owing to hyperoxygenation18,19. To avoid over oxygenation in \nthe portal vein, we mixed the deoxygenated venous blood from the \nblood reservoir with the freshly oxygenated blood from the oxygen\ufffeator. An algorithm enabled automatic adjustment of oxygen satura\ufffetion in the portal vein to maintain a target saturation of 65% in the \nvena cava (Fig. 1d). With this approach, the need for vasodilators \ndecreased from 285±162milliliters per week to 41±34milliliters \nper week (P=0.011), despite maintaining physiologic flow in the \nhepatic artery (Fig. 2i).\nLiver movement. In the human body, the liver and other organs move \nrhythmically owing to attachment to the diaphragm.

An inflatable balloon \nwas positioned beneath the mat and connected to an air oscillator to \ninduce oscillating movement (automated lifting and lowering) of the \nliver 15 times per minute (Supplementary Fig. 1). To test adequate \nperfusion after 7d of ex vivo perfusion, we evaluated the distribu\ufffetion of the radioactive tracer 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), as an \nindicator of preserved metabolism and viability inside the liver with \npositron emission tomography combined with computed tomogra\ufffephy (PET-CT). This approach demonstrated homogeneous metab\ufffeolism and iodinated contrast medium distribution with absence of \nnon-perfused areas in contact places to the silicon mat (Fig. 2k).\nEarly phase of reperfusion of pig livers after 7-d perfusion. We \ntested the viability of eight pig livers perfused with autologous \nblood after 1 week of perfusion without exchanging the perfusate \nor adding any blood products. All livers showed preserved liver \nfunctions with production of bile flow over the entire perfusion \nperiod (Supplementary Fig. 3). While we observed an initial tem\ufffeporary increase of injury markers such as aspartate aminotrans\ufffeferase (AST) and 8-hydroxydesoxyguanosin (8-OHdG) within the \nfirst 12h of perfusion, these values declined in the following days \n(Supplementary Fig. 3). Cytochrome C, an established marker for \nmitochondrial membrane injury, did not increase over the 7-d \nperiod and histology after 7-d of perfusion revealed no relevant \nnecrosis or features of endothelial activation (Supplementary \nFigs. 3 and 4).\nTo test in\xa0vivo reperfusion injury and viability after a 7-d perfu\ufffesion, we transplanted three livers in recipient pigs of similar size. As \ncontrols, we also transplanted five livers that had been kept only for \n2–3h with static cold storage before transplantation22. The aim of \nthese experiments was to confirm feasibility of vascular anastomo\ufffeses and to investigate the early phase of reperfusion after long-term \nperfusion. All transplant experiments were terminated 3h after \ntransplantation under general anesthesia because survival experi\ufffements with cessation of general anesthesia were prohibited by our \nlocal animal protection authorities. Therefore, the main endpoints \nof these transplantation experiments remained early markers of \nreperfusion injury, including release of transaminases and histol\ufffeogy. These results indicated no difference between release of liver \nenzymes and histology as compared to controls livers that had been \ntransplanted after standard cold storage without long-term preser\ufffevation in the machine perfusion system22 (Supplementary Fig. 5).\nSeven-day perfusion and assessment of human livers. Next we \napplied the technology to human livers. Although pig and human \nlivers have similar size and architecture, several substantial adjust\ufffements were necessary to successfully perfuse human livers. First, \nin contrast to pig liver perfusion with autologous fresh donor pig \nblood, the perfusate used for human livers consisted of preserved \npacked human blood products with altered electrolyte levels (for \nexample, high potassium (>10mmol) and low pH (<7.0)). Thus, \nelectrolyte levels and pH were corrected through an integrated \ndialysis before starting perfusion. Second, pig and human livers dis\ufffeclosed differences in the sensitivity toward glucagon, with the need \nto adjust glucagon levels (0.11Uml−1\n in human versus 0.01Uml−1\nin pigs). Third, the vasodilator nitroprussiat used in pigs is not \napproved for human use in Switzerland and was therefore replaced \nby epoprostinolium (Flolan, GlaxoSmithKline)11. Fourth, the final \nhuman protocol includes ursodeoxycholic acid, which is commonly \nused in the clinic, in place of taurocholic acid derivatives for bile \nflow stimulation.\nWe perfused ten human livers that had been declined for trans\ufffeplantation by all hospitals in Switzerland, then in all Europe owing \nto poor quality, and as such were to be discarded (Supplementary \nTable 1). We connected the human livers to the ex vivo perfusion \nmachine through the hepatic artery, portal vein, vena cava and bile \nduct. The perfusion was conducted using a blood-based perfusate, \nreconstituted from packed erythrocytes, fresh frozen plasma, albu\ufffemin and platelets (Supplementary Table 2) at 34 °C owing to protec\ufffetive effects at this temperature23.\nIn standard clinical transplantation, organs are preserved at about \n4 °C under anaerobic conditions for up to 12–18h before implanta\ufffetion. Many of these livers suffer additionally from prepreservation \ninjury (that is, injury occurring before recovery of the organ owing \nto, for example, instability of the donor before death or medical \ntreatment in intensive care units) and ischemia–reperfusion injury \nat the time of preservation and transplantation24. Consequently, cell \ndeath (~15%) is observed in most post-transplant biopsy speci\ufffemens, even under optimal clinical conditions25,26. Similar to clini\ufffecal transplantation, ischemia–reperfusion injury is unavoidable in \nmachine-perfused livers when connecting the liver to the machine \nafter cold storage and subsequently perfusing with oxygenated per\ufffefusates. To assess the livers during machine perfusion, we measured \na number of parameters. In the perfusate, we monitored hepatocel\ufffelular enzymes (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and AST), signaling \nFig. 2 | Step-by-step integration of the components for long-term perfusion using pig livers. a, Amount of glycogen per milligram of liver tissue according \nto the glucose-level control method. In the hyperglycemic group, hyperglycemia (>10\u2009mmol\u2009l−1\n) in the perfusate was maintained by constant glucose \ninfusion (n=\u20094 pig livers).

During perfusion, mitotic cells were also documented as \na measure of preserved cell proliferation capacity ex vivo (Fig. 3i,j). \nAfter 1 week of perfusion, liver biopsies in livers 1 to 6 did not show \nevidence of substantial cell death (Supplementary Fig. 6). A PET-CT \ndemonstrated preserved metabolism with absence of relevant non\ufffeperfused areas in places of contact with the silicon mat after 1 week \nof perfusion (Fig. 3k).

Therefore, we consider \nthese listed liver functions only as viability markers in combination with adequate response to hormones and vasoactive substances, as well as histology. \nAdditionally, it should be noted that the kinetics of cytokine and injury marker release are more decisive than peak values, as absolute levels are dependent \non liver mass and perfusate volume.\nNature Biotechnology | VOL 38 | February 2020 | 189–198 | www.nature.com/naturebiotechnology 196\n\nNature Biotechnology Articles\nHemodynamic response to vasoactive substances. Under physi\ufffeologic conditions, hepatic artery flow is tightly controlled by the \nautonomic nervous system and vasoactive substances, which are \ndependent on liver signals, whereas portal vein flow acts indepen\ufffedently9\n. The hepatic artery response to vasoactive substances is \ntherefore a valuable sign of organ viability9\n. With a flow of 1 lmin−1\n, \nthe portal pressure could be maintained in physiological range \n(<10mmHg) in each liver except in two livers (livers 1 and 3) \nthat had pre-existing fibrosis and cirrhosis (portal vein pressure \n12–15mmHg), a typical feature observed in the clinic with patients \nsuffering from injured parenchyma. For livers 1 to 6, flow rates in \nthe hepatic artery remained constant with infusion of vasoactive \nsubstances (Figs. 1e and 5a). By contrast, livers 7 to 10 became \nunresponsive to even high amounts of vasoconstrictors (vasoplegia) \nshortly after initiating perfusion (n=1) or on day 4 (n=2). This \nvasoplegia translated into a pressure of less than 45mmHg in the \nhepatic artery despite high vasoconstrictor infusion at a hepatic \nartery flow of 0.6 lmin−1\n (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 7).\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we developed a perfusion machine preserving pig and \nhuman livers for 1 week with consistently good outcomes as assessed \nby intact liver structure on histology and preserved function as indi\ufffecated by bile production, synthesis of blood proteins, maintenance \nof cellular energy (ATP), as well as an appropriate response to pan\ufffecreatic hormones or vasoactive drugs. Because of restrictions by our \nlocal animal protection authorities, we were not able to assess trans\ufffeplantation efficacy beyond the time of extubation, but observation \nfor a few hours after reperfusion showed no differences between \nlivers perfused for 1 week as compared to the control group trans\ufffeplanted after a standard short period of cold storage.\nThe human livers available for this inaugural study were severely \ninjured and heterogeneous with respect to cold and warm ischemia \ntimes, underlying liver diseases, donor age, duration of intensive care \nunit treatment among other parameters (Supplementary Table 1). \nBecause of an organ shortage in our country, a control group of less \ninjured livers is not available, as such livers are consistently used \nfor transplantation27,28. The heterogeneity and poor quality of the \nlivers poses difficulties in assessing the outcome overall. However, \nthe many measurements obtained throughout the 1-week perfusion \nat 34 °C suggest that many of the livers maintained viability and to \nsome extent recovered from prepreservation and initial ischemia–\nreperfusion injuries following connection to the machine.\nIn addition, several parameters of viability remain difficult to \nassess, such as the long-term viability of intrahepatic bile ducts. The \ndevelopment of bile duct strictures occurs in some grafts up to 1 year \nafter transplantation, typically as a result of prolonged warm isch\ufffeemic injury29. Previous studies suggested glucose clearance in bile as \na sign of cholangiocyte viability4,30, proposing a bile/perfusate glu\ufffecose ratio less than 0.7 as a cut off for predicting viability30. Notably, \nthese criteria were all met in our perfused livers (Supplementary \nFig. 8). The final proof of bile duct integrity, however, can only be \nassessed after transplantation of perfused livers in recipients with at \nleast a 1-year follow-up29. Similarly, coagulation, an additional typi\ufffecal parameter of liver synthesis31, was difficult to monitor during ex \nvivo perfusion. Interpretation of factor V and international normal\ufffeized ratio (INR) during ex vivo perfusion is limited owing to the \nheparinised circuit32.\nTherefore, we interpreted liver function by a combination of \nATP synthesis, bile flow, ammonia clearance and BUN production, \nas well as by the need for glucose substitution, which is another \nwell-known marker of irreversible hepatocellular injury. These \nparameters were combined with the response of the livers to added \nvasoconstrictors, as failing liver grafts are frequently characterized \nby severe vasoplegia, requiring high dosages of vasoconstrictors to \nmaintain adequate blood flow in the clinical setting33. Some livers \nbecame unresponsive to vasoconstrictors during the perfusion \ncourse. The reason for failure in those livers probably relates to \nexcessive warm or cold ischemia times, in combination with prep\ufffereservation injury recognized in the clinic as extended graft criteria, \nenhancing severe ischemia–reperfusion injury17. In Fig. 5, we sum\ufffemarize our current understanding of how to best assess liver func\ufffetion and viability during ex vivo perfusion. Besides the conventional \nparameters (that is, lactate clearance, perfusate pH and bile produc\ufffetion) as previously proposed4,34–36, we rely on the response to glyco\ufffelytic hormones, vasoactive drugs and on clearance of ammonia, as \nwell as histology and ATP synthesis.\nBile production, which is one of the most convincing indicators \nof liver viability after transplantation31, was present in the majority \nof livers perfused for 1 week.\nSome of the human livers perfused for 1 week displayed a course \nof laboratory parameters and histology that was similar to those \nobserved in the clinical setting of liver transplantation. For example, \nas in some of the livers perfused for 1 week, AST and ALT levels \npeak at around day 1, likely owing to some hepatocyte injury upon \nreperfusion, but decline rapidly thereafter similar to successful \nclinical liver transplantation31,37. Likewise, blood bilirubin increased \nduring ex vivo perfusion with a delay in some livers as compared to \nliver enzymes37.\nWe did observe that the perfused livers consistently lost weight \nduring the 7-d perfusion period, reaching about 25% of the initial \ngraft mass. While the underlying mechanisms and clinical relevance \nof this finding remains unclear, we speculate that this phenomenon \nis largely related to recovery of mainly cellular swelling in injured \nlivers, and therefore without negative impact on hepatic func\ufffetion. Similarly, the well-established circadian liver weight fluctua\ufffetion has no negative impact on hepatic function38. Of note, we did \nnot observe any weight change when using healthy pig livers \n(preperfusion weight of 1.7±0.03 kg, post-perfusion weight \n1.6±0.1 kg). A similar loss of liver weight without substantial \nimpact on function has been observed during short-term normo\ufffethermic perfusion of livers from donations after circulatory death \nor steatotic liver grafts12.\nWe grouped the livers on the basis of organ viability and pre\ufffeserved integrity on histology on 1-week perfusion. Livers 7 to 10 \nfailed to reach the targeted perfusion duration developing signs of \nprogressive liver failure, which required premature termination of \nperfusion. The observation of failure to respond to hormones and \nvasoactive drugs, loss of integrity on histology, as well as the absence \nof decline in injury and inflammation markers in perfusate in failed \nlivers, offered a solid base to assess viability in long-term liver \nperfusion. These parameters may be advantageous over conven\ufffetionally used liver function parameters in the clinic and in selection \nof grafts for transplantation (Fig. 5), which were not substantially \ndifferent in our system. However, further studies will be needed to \ndetermine which are the best measures of liver viability after long\ufffeterm perfusion.\nOverall, the results in group 1 livers (livers 1 to 6) are promising \nand suggest that machine perfusion for 1 week may support viabil\ufffeity of human livers, although testing with higher-quality livers and \ntransplantation of perfused livers into recipients will be required to \nfully assess the potential of our approach.\nIn ischemia–reperfusion injury, reoxygenation of ischemic \ncells triggers a burst of reactive oxygen species, which are released \nmainly by mitochondria25. Consequently, machine perfusion strat\ufffeegies should target primarily mitochondrial metabolism39, for \nexample, by applying membrane-permeable scavengers and revers\ufffeible inhibitors of electron transfer, or by prevention of the open\ufffeing of permeability transition pores. An ex vivo system offers the \npotential advantage of avoiding such undesirable systemic effects \nin the recipient. We envision our technology being used primarily \nwith organs currently declined for transplantation, with long-term \nNature Biotechnology | VOL 38 | February 2020 | 189–198 | www.nature.com/naturebiotechnology 197\n\nArticles Nature Biotechnology\nex vivo perfusion under physiologic conditions potentially enabling \nthe rescue of organs or their modification in a variety of ways. For \nexample, 1-week perfusion may enable repair of severely steatotic \nlivers, modification of the immunogenicity of the graft or recipient \nto induce tolerance, or treatment of tumors in livers using effec\ufffetive chemotherapeutic agents that are too toxic for systemic use. In \naddition, long-term perfusion would allow organs to be transported \nsafely over long distances, improving worldwide organ sharing and \nlogistics for transplantation in many centers1,3\n. Another opportunity \nin the future might be to enable liver regeneration, with a donor \nliver split into several anatomic segments to regrow in the machine. \nRecent surgical procedures have shown that massive liver regenera\ufffetion in humans can occur within 6d of major tissue loss7\n. If feasible, \nsuch an approach could double or even triple the availability of \norgans for transplantation. We may also imagine the use of partial \ngrafts for auto-transplantation in patients with liver cancer, obviat\ufffeing the need for immune suppression.\nIn summary, this study introduces a perfusion technology devel\ufffeoped by a group of surgeons, biologists and engineers that enables \nmaintenance of injured human livers in a functional state for 1 week \nex vivo. With further testing to demonstrate its use with injured liv\ufffeers and long-term transplantation success, this machine may pro\ufffevide an avenue for providing more patients with liver grafts.\nOnline content\nAny methods, additional references, Nature Research reporting \nsummaries, source data, extended data, supplementary informa\ufffetion, acknowledgements, peer review information; details of author \ncontributions and competing interests; and statements of data and \ncode availability are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-\n019-0374-x.\nReceived: 23 December 2018; Accepted: 18 November 2019; \nPublished online: 13 January 2020\nReferences\n1.

Ten human livers were obtained for research after being declined \nfor transplantation nationwide and after consent was obtained from the next of kin. \nThe local ethics committee of the Canton of Zurich approved the study protocol \n(2017-000412). The declined livers were procured in a standardized technique \nusing IGL-1 for cooling and preservation. Some livers from donations after \ncirculatory death were declined after initial hypothermic oxygenated liver machine \nperfusion for clinical purpose28 (Supplementary Table 1). During setup of the \nperfusion machine, the livers were prepared on the back table including removal \nof the gall bladder and cannulation of the hepatic artery, portal vein, vena cava \nand bile duct. Shortly before the start of liver perfusion, the preservation solution \nwas flushed out with 2 l of cold (4 °C) Ringerfundin solution (B. Braun Melsungen) \nthrough the portal vein (1.5 l) and hepatic artery (0.5 l).\nPerfusion machine and protocol for human livers. Hemodynamic control. One \ncentrifugal pump (Thoratec CentriMag) in combination with three pinch valves \n(Resolution Air MPPV-8) were used to maintain the desired flow or pressure \nconditions in the perfusion system. Flow sensors (Sonoflow CO.56) and pressure \nsensors (PendoTECH Single Use Pressure Sensors) measured flow and pressure in \nthe respective silicon tube (RAUMEDIC) lines. Thereby, the control system aimed \nto maintain a desired flow (for example, 1 lmin−1\n) in the portal vein and the desired \npressure conditions in the hepatic artery. To increase its resistance and provide the \nrequired flow rate ratio between the portal vein and hepatic artery, a pinch valve \nclamps the tube leading to the portal vein. In the hepatic artery, a pulsatile flow was \napplied targeting an MAP of at least 65mmHg (for example, systolic and diastolic \npressure of 80mmHg to 50mmHg respectively with 60 beats per minute), while \nlimiting the mean hepatic-artery flow to a maximum of 0.6 lmin−1\n. Pulsatile flow in \nthe hepatic artery was realized by pulsatile operation (varying rotational speed) of \nthe blood pump. Thereby, the rotational speed of the pump was defined in the same \nwaveform as the desired arterial pressure pulse.\nTo prevent the flow in the hepatic artery from exceeding 0.6 lmin−1\n, the system \ninjected the vasoconstrictor Neo Synephrine HCL (phenylephrine, Ospedalia) \nat an upper bound of 0.55 lmin−1\n. On the other hand, to maintain a lower limit \nat least 0.25 lmin−1\n, the system injected the vasodilator Flolan (epoprostenol, \nGlaxoSmithKline). In both cases, this was realized by means of a proportional \nintegral controller, defining the infusion rate on the basis of the measured hepatic\ufffeartery flow rate.\nVena cava pressure control. Inadequate blood outflow from the liver leads to \na vascular congestion and an ischemic hepatocellular damage. Thus, the \nsystem controlled the vena cava pressure around the atmospheric pressure \n(approximately 0mmHg).\nThe vena cava was connected via tube set directly to the blood reservoir. \nBy means of the height difference between the liver and the reservoir, a suction \npressure was induced and additionally controlled through a pinch valve between \nthe vena cava and the reservoir to control a desired vena cava pressure. The pinch \nvalve induced an additional pressure drop, allowing elevation of the pressure at \nthe vena cava to the desired levels. If the blood pressure inside the vena cava was \nlower than the surrounding ambient pressure, the vessel wall collapsed (usually \naround 0mmHg), closed shortly and therefore induced a certain (negative) \npressure fluctuation in the VC line. This induced pressure fluctuation was utilized \nin the control system to target the desired vena cava pressure. Finally, this pressure \nfluctuation (collapse of the vena cava) was detected by the pressure sensor in the \nvena cava line, with the control system reacting accordingly by closing the pinch \nvalve in the vena cava line and thereby increasing the target vena cava pressure \nautomatically by 1mmHg, slightly above the fluctuation point. The system \ncontinuously monitored the minimum and maximum value of the vena cava \npressure of the last 30 s. If the difference between the minimum and maximum \nvena cava pressure in this time interval was greater than a certain threshold defined \nby the system (usually 10mmHg), a fluctuation was detected. Afterward, the \ncontrol system immediately increased the pressure in the vena cava line by a value \nof 1mmHg, as described above. During normal operation, the system continuously \nsearched for the fluctuation point. This was done by permanently decreasing the \npressure set point for the vena cava by a rate of 1mmHg per hour. Once fluctuation \nhad been detected, the set point was again increased using the algorithm described \nabove, and the system again began to search for the fluctuation pressure. This \ncontrol strategy was implemented owing to the fact that the pressure distribution \ninside the vena cava line depended on the flow rate and therefore the vena cava \npressure was also flow-rate dependent. During the perfusion duration, the total \nflow rate through the vena cava line always varied over time. Therefore, a steady \nsearch for the fluctuation point was implemented (Supplementary Fig. 1).\nFeedback-controlled injection of insulin and glucagon. An online glucose sensor \n(CITSens Bio Glucose Sensor, C-CIT Sensor) was integrated into the arterial line \nfor real-time perfusate glucose measurement. The integrated sensor continuously \nmeasured the glucose in the perfusate. The blood glucose level was kept in a \nrange defined by the user. If the blood glucose value surpassed the desired level, \nthe system automatically injected insulin (Actrapid, Novo Nordisk Pharma), or, \nif the blood glucose undershot a lower threshold, the system injected glucagon \n(GlucaGen, Novo Nordisk Pharma) in a closed-loop manner to maintain the \nperfusate glucose in a defined range. Both hormones can be kept at a basal rate \nas defined by the user. The injection rate of insulin was in the range of 0.02 to \n4.5 IUh−1\n depending on perfusate glucose level. The glucagon was injected at rates \nof 0.02 to 0.5 IUh−1\n.\nBlood-gas analysis and control. By the use of an oxygenator (Medos Hilite 2400 LT) \nand three individual gas-flow controllers (Bronkhorst Schweiz) for oxygen, \nnitrogen and CO2, the partial oxygen pressure (pO2), partial CO2 pressure (pCO2) \nand pH of the blood were controlled. An online blood-gas sensor (Terumo CDI \n500 Shunt Sensor) continuously measured pO2, pCO2 and pH. A proportional \nintegral controller defined the oxygen concentration in the gas supply of the \noxygenator to maintain pO2 at the desired level (10–12 kPa). Another proportional \nintegral controller defined the total gas flow rate (oxygen and nitrogen) to control \nthe wash-out rate of pCO2 in the perfusate. With CO2 being present in its dissolved \nform as carbonic acid in the blood, the pCO2 level could be manipulated to \nvary pH in a certain range. The pCO2 was allowed to vary from 4.5 to 6.5 kPa to \nmaintain a target pH of around 7.4. With the inverse proportionality between \npCO2 and pH, an increasing pCO2 lead to a decrease in pH, that is, the blood \nbecame more acidic. Therefore, to reduce the pH, less pCO2 was washed out by \nreducing the total gas flow rate through the oxygenator, resulting in an increase \nof pCO2. The control was implemented by means of a control cascade with the \ninner control loop maintaining the secondary target pCO2 and the outer control \nloop maintaining the primary target pH of 7.4 by varying the pCO2 set point \nin the defined range of 4.5 to 6.5 kPa. CO2 was only supplied in the gas stream to \nthe oxygenator before starting the liver perfusion and in the initial phase until \nthe liver produced enough CO2 to maintain the target pCO2 in the blood. In the \nnormal perfusion phase, a surplus of CO2 is produced by the liver, requiring it \nto be washed out.\nPhysiologic oxygen saturation in portal vein. In the in\xa0vivo situation, the portal \nvein originates from the intestinal organs and, therefore, contains less oxygen as \ncompared to the hepatic artery. To mimic the physiologically reduced oxygen \nsaturation in the portal vein, venous blood from the reservoir was mixed with \na portion of arterial blood leaving the oxygenator. For this purpose, the pO2\nwas measured in the portal vein by means of an online blood-gas sensor (Shunt \nSensor, Terumo, CDI 500) as stated above. In addition, the system continuously \nmonitored the oxygen saturation in the vena cava (vSO2) using a saturation sensor \n(CDI H/S Cuvette, Terumo, CDI 500). To mimic the physiological venous oxygen \nsaturation in the portal vein, venous blood from the reservoir (blood from the vena \ncava with low, venous saturation) bypassed the oxygenator and was mixed with \na portion of the arterial blood from the oxygenator to achieve desired saturation \nlevels. The control was realized by means of a cascaded control. The inner control \nloop controlled the blood flow rate of the oxygenated blood (arterial blood) and \nthe ‘bypass flow rate’ by means of a continuous pinch valve. The outer control \nloop controlled the oxygen saturation of the vena cava by varying the set point of \nthe bypass flow rate. The goal was to keep a stable oxygenation level in the vena \ncava of 65% by varying the portal vein oxygen content. The total flow rate in the \nportal vein was maintained at 1 lmin−1\n. An increase of flow in the bypass was \nautomatically compensated to maintain a constant total flow rate in the portal vein.\nFeedback-controlled dialysis. A dialysis loop has been integrated into the perfusion \nsystem to supply and/or remove electrolytes, bicarbonates and metabolic waste \nproducts. By defining the TMF of fluid across the dialysis filter, dialysis was further \nutilized to control the blood hematocrit level by adding or removing fluid from the \nperfusion loop. A roller pump with multiple individual channels (Ismatec Reglo \nICC) controlled the inflow and outflow of dialysate to the dialysis filter (Ultraflux \nAV-Paed, Fresenius Medical Care), thereby allowing the system to define the TMF. \nThe targeted TMF was defined by the user or the controller of the system. Usually, \nthe TMF was in the range of −100mlh−1\n to 100mlh−1\n. By controlling the TMF, the \nsystem can vary the amount of blood plasma in the perfusate and, thus, control \nthe hematocrit level in perfusate. For this purpose, the control system used the \ncontinuous hematocrit measurement from the Terumo CDI 500 Cuvette sensor in \nthe vena cava line.\nPerfusate components and additives. The perfusate consisted of blood-group\ufffematched human red blood cells (approximately 1.4 l), fresh frozen plasma \n(approximately 0.8 l) and 1 unit of platelets from the human blood bank. A heparin \nbolus (5000U) was given at the start of perfusion. Albumin was added until it \nreached reference range (>2.0 g l\n−1\n). As soon as the tube set was primed with the \nperfusate, the dialysate (multiBIC, Fresenius Medical Care) flow rate to and from \nthe dialysis filter was set at a rate of 1,000–2,000mlh−1\n to correct electrolytes and \npH before connection of the liver to the perfusion system. The liver was connected \nto the system when sodium was in physiologic range and pH was around 7.2. \nBicarbonates (sodium hydrogen carbonate 8.4%, B. Braun Melsungen) were also \nused to correct pH at dialysis start if pH was below 7.0. During liver perfusion, the \ndialysate inflow rate to the dialysis filter was typically set to 200mlh−1\n. Dialysis \noutflow (leaving dialysis filter) rate was adjusted automatically by the control \nsystem depending on the measured hematocrit level. All the components of the \nperfusate are summarized in Supplementary Table 2.\nNature Biotechnology | www.nature.com/naturebiotechnology\n\nArticles Nature Biotechnology\nPig livers. The experiments were performed in accordance with the Swiss Animal \nProtection Law and Ordinance. Female land race pigs (around 90 kg) were \nobtained 1 week before surgery to allow acclimatization. The pigs were fasted \novernight before the experiment with free access to water. The pigs were sedated \nwith ketamine (Ketasol-100, 15mg kg−1\n), azaperon (Stresnil, 2mg kg−1\n) and \natropinsulfate (Atropin 1%, 0.05mg kg−1\n). General anesthesia was maintained with \nisoflurane (Attane, 1–2%) and propofol (Propofol Lipuro 1%, 3–5mg kg−1h−1\n). \nLaparotomy was performed under general anesthesia. The hepatic artery and \nportal vein were isolated for flow measurement with VeriQ (Medistim Germany \nGmbH) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. Flow in the hepatic \nartery was measured distal to the splenic artery and after ligating gastric branches. \nPhysiologic in\xa0vivo vascular flow rates in pigs for the hepatic artery and portal vein, \nmeasured at the time of organ procurement, were 0.25±0.07 lmin−1\n (n=5) and \n1.0±0.2 lmin−1\n (n=5), respectively. These values served therefore as a reference \nfor the ex vivo setting. Heparin (200 IUkg−1\n) was administered and the aorta \nwas cannulated. Pig livers and blood were procured in standardized fashion22. \nLivers were connected to the perfusion machine after back-table preparation \nof the vessels (hepatic artery, portal vein, vena cava and bile duct). The circuit \nwas primed with autologous, leukocyte-depleted pig blood (around 2.7 l) with \naddition of albumin (200ml, 20% solvent), bicarbonates (20ml), calcium gluconate \n(10ml), piperacillinum–tazobactamum (2.2 g) and methylprednisolon (500mg). \nThe perfusion technology was developed in a step-by-step approach with the \nfollowing stages as reported in the results section: glucose metabolism; minimizing \nhemolysis; electrolyte control; physiologic venous oxygen saturation in the portal \nvein; and liver movement. Pig livers were transplanted after ex vivo perfusion \naccording to a previously established protocol22.\nSampling. Blood samples were taken before the start of perfusion, every 15min \nduring the first hours of perfusion and hourly for the next 5h. Thereafter, blood \nsampling was performed daily. Tissue samples (liver biopsies) were collected before \nthe start of perfusion, after 3 and 6h of perfusion and afterward on a daily basis. \nBile was sampled daily.\nMeasurements. Perfusate. Blood-gas analysis from arterial (hepatic artery), portal \n(portal vein) and caval (vena cava) lines was performed using the Radiometer \nABL90 FLEX. The blood-gas analysis data were used to calibrate the glucose \nsensor and the online sensors of the Terumo, CDI 500 device. A Piccolo Xpress \nanalyzer (Abaxis) was used for the quantitative determination of BUN, albumin, \nalanine aminotransferase (ALT), AST, total bilirubin, gamma glutamyltransferase \nand alkaline phosphatase using the Piccolo general chemistry 13 panel (Abaxis). \nAmmonia levels were determined with the PocketChem BA (PA-4140, Arkray). \nFactor V was measured by the clinical laboratory of the University Hospital Zurich.\nPlasma from perfusate. Plasma samples were obtained from the blood-based \nperfusate by centrifugation using standard protocol and snap frozen in liquid \nnitrogen for further analysis (long-term preservation at −80 °C). Free hemoglobin \nwas measured spectrometrically assay using Drabkin solution (D5941, Sigma). \nThe cytokine levels in the plasma were analyzed using LEGENDplex Human \nInflammation Panel (740118, Biolegend). Fifty microliters of plasma were assayed \nfollowing the manufacturer’s instruction. In human livers 7 to 10, the upper \nmeasurable limit of the analytical method was taken for statistical analysis, because \nthis value was exceeded. 8-Oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine (KA0444, Abnova) for DNA \ndamage and cytochrome C (CSB-EL006328PI, Cusabio) for mitochondrial injury \nwere measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the \nmanufacturer’s recommendation.\nTissue. Tissue biopsies were taken at different time points and positions before \nand during perfusion using standard protocols, and either stored in formalin for \nhistological analysis or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for \nfurther analysis.\nHistology. The following staining procedures were performed on random 3-µm\ufffethick paraffin-embedded liver sections: hematoxylin and eosin, cleaved caspase 3 \n(9661S, Cell Signaling) staining as an apoptosis marker, von Willebrand Factor \n(IR527, DAKO) for endothelial cell activation, Ki-67 staining as a proliferation \nmarker in bile ducts (IR626, DAKO), pH3 staining as a mitosis marker (M-06-\n570-3KL, Milipore), CD68 staining for liver macrophages (M0876, DAKO) and \ncytokeratin 7 staining for bile ducts (DAKO). PAS staining was performed for \nqualitative analysis of glycogen content.\nFrozen tissue. Total RNA was extracted from 10mg of liver tissue using RNeasy \nMini kit (Qiagen) including a DNAse I digestion step (RNase-free DNase set, \nQuiagen) on column. The purified RNA was transcribed to cDNA using the \nqScript cDNA SuperMix reagent (VWR). TaqMan gene-expression assays and \nan 18S rRNA internal control (TaqMan ribosomal RNA control reagents) were \nfrom PE Applied Biosystems. Sequence amplification and data analysis were \nperformed on the ABI Prism 7500 Sequence Detector system (PE Applied \nBiosystems). Taqman gene-expression assays used were Ss03384604_u1 for \nporcine IL6, Ss03382372_u1 for porcine IL10, Ss03392385_m1 for porcine ICAM1, \nHs00164932_m1 for human ICAM1 and 4308329 for 18S rRNA. The expression \nvalues were normalized to the sample at the perfusion start. Intrahepatic glycogen \ncontent was determined using the Glycogen Assay kit (MAK016, Sigma) following \nthe manufacturer’s instructions. Total protein was extracted from tissue (10mg) in \nRIPA buffer using the standard protocol. Protein quantification and immunoblots \nwere performed using Biorad protocols and systems, and the antibodies used were \nphospho-Akt (S472) (9271S, Cell Signaling), α-tubulin (2125S, Cell Signaling), \nphospho-GSK3β (S9) (5558S, Cell Signaling) and GSK3β (12456S, Cell Signaling). \nMitochondrial function was analyzed by liver ATP content using ENLITEN \nrLuciferase/Luciferin Reagent (FF2021, Promega). In brief, the frozen tissue \n(10mg) was homogenized in 1.0ml of ice‐cold TBS buffer and deproteinized using \na TCA kit (ab204708, Abcam). One hundred microliters of diluted supernatant \nwere assayed by addition of 50μl of ATP monitoring reagent. Luminiscence \nkinetics of samples and ATP standards (Sigma) were measured using a Citation 3 \nimaging reader (Biotek). ATP concentrations were extrapolated from the reading of \nthe kinetic showing better regression of the calibration curve and normalized with \nthe protein content in the samples before deproteinization.\nBile. DRI-CHEM 4000i (Fujifilm) was used for quantitative determination of total \nbilirubin. Bile glucose was measured using a Radiometer ABL90 FLEX device.\nStatistics. Data collection and graphs were performed with Matlab R2017a \n(MathWorks). The data from different experiments were bundled at the same \ntime points. Data points were bundled to a set when at least two data points of \nindividual experiments were available. Then, the mean and s.d. of the bundled \ndata points was calculated. Owing to logistical reasons, the daily sampling of the \nvarious experiments could not be conducted at exactly the same times, therefore \nthey were also bundled over a time period of a ±9h. For comparison of two \ngroups, two-tailed Student’s t test was used. Data were reported as mean±s.d. \nP<0.05 was considered as significant. Exact sample size (n) for each experimental \ngroup and units of measurement were provided in the text and figure captions. No \nassumptions or corrections were applied in statistical analysis.

Email: s.large@nhs.net.\nFifty years since the first successful human heart transplant from a non-heart beating donor, this concept of \nheart transplantation from donation after circulatory determined death (DCD) promises to be one of the \nmost exciting developments in heart transplantation. Heart transplantation has established itself as the best \ntherapeutic option for patients with end-stage heart failure, with the opportunity to provide these patients \nwith a near-normal quality of life. However, this treatment is severely limited by the availability of suitable \ndonor hearts. In recent times, heart transplantation has been limited to using donor hearts from donors \nfollowing brain stem death. The use of donor hearts from DCD had been thought to be associated with high \nrisk and poor outcomes until recent developments in organ perfusion and retrieval techniques have shown \nthat this valuable resource may provide an answer to the global shortage of suitable donor hearts. With \nestablished DCD heart transplant programmes reporting encouraging results, this technique has been shown \nto be comparable to the current gold standard of donation after brain death (DBD) heart transplantation. \nKeywords: Heart; transplant; circulatory death\nSubmitted Jan 11, 2018.

Recent data from the International \nSociety for Heart and Lung Transplantation from 1982 to \n2014 including data on more than 100,000 heart transplants \nshow continuously improving median survival with patients \nfrom 2002–2008 benefitting from a median survival of \n11.9 years (1). Despite being such an effective therapy, its \nutilization is limited by the short supply of suitable donor \nhearts. In the United Kingdom (UK), only 27% of hearts \nfrom donors following brain stem death [donation after \nbrain death (DBD)] that are offered are eventually accepted \nfor transplantation. Unfortunately, this translates to 43% of \npatients on the heart transplant waiting list either dying or \nbecoming too sick to be suitable for a heart transplant (1).\nTo a d d r e s s t h e i n c r e a s i n g d e m a n d f o r h e a r t \ntransplantation, the heart transplant community were forced \nnot only to extend the acceptability criteria for DBD hearts \nbut also to re-explore heart transplantation using hearts \nfrom donation after circulatory determined death (DCD). \nUntil recently, anxieties concerning the unquantifiable \nwarm ischemic injury to the myocardium following cardiac \narrest coupled with the inability to assess function of the \nasystolic heart have been major hurdles preventing further \nattempts at transplanting DCD hearts. However, with \nadvances in technology, research and the desperate need \nfor suitable donor hearts, successful DCD heart transplant \nprogrammes have been established with very encouraging \nresults to date.\nThe potential for DCD heart donation\nDonor shortage is not limited to cardiac transplantation \nalone. Despite early transplantation being largely from \nDCD, the mainstay of transplantation has been from DBD. \nIt has only been since the end of the century following the \n\n76 Page et al.

In the \nUK, DCD organ donation from Maastricht category III \ndonors contributed to 32% of all organs transplanted from \ndeceased donors in 2016–2017 (6).\nA retrospective review of the UK transplant registry data \nheld by NHS Blood and Transplant over a 3-year period from \n2011 to 2013, revealed that of 3,073 DCD donors referred, \n149 (5%) would be potential DCD heart donors (7). In this \nanalysis, DCD donors referred were considered unsuitable \nfor heart donation based on lack of appropriate consent, age \nover 50 years, cardiac arrest in the donor, a cardiac cause \nof death, cardiac risk factors, cardiovascular disease, the \nuse of any inotropes in the donor and a functional warm \nischemic time (FWIT) of greater than 30 minutes. FWIT \nis defined as the time from when the systolic blood pressure \nof the donor reaches 50 mmHg following withdrawal of life \nsupporting therapy (WLST) till mechanical asystole. The \ntime limit of 30 minutes for FWIT is adopted from that \nused by abdominal transplant surgeons. However, there \nhas been well established small and large animal models to \nsuggest that heart would be tolerant to 30 minutes of warm \nischemia (8). Although the application of this criteria is more \nstringent than the current protocols applied to DCD heart \ntransplantation in the UK, this conservative projection would \nhave translated to at least a 30% increase in heart transplant \nactivity over the same period.\nAnimal models of DCD heart donation\nThere have been a number of animal models of DCD heart \ntransplantation that have been explored.\nThe Japanese group experimented on a canine model \nusing exsanguination as a mode of death, antemortem \nconditioning followed by in situ machine perfusion and \ncooling to 20 ℃ prior to heart retrieval and cold storage (9). \nThey were able to wean the hearts of cardiopulmonary \nbypass in a recipient model in this series. However, there \nare a number of issues in translating this into practice in the \nUK. First antemortem interventions are not allowed in the \nUK and such pre-conditioning of the donor heart prior to \ndeath would not be possible. Secondly, this method does \nnot allow for functional assessment of the donor organ on \nits own. However, this method showed that cold storage \nof DCD hearts with evidence of myocardial viability post\ufffetransplantation might be a potential strategy.\nGundry et al., used a hypoxic lamb model with ante\ufffemortem pre-conditioning prior to DCD heart retrieval (10). \nImplantation was performed with the recipient cooled to \n20 ℃. In his initial experiments, the time from withdrawal \nto donation was limited to less than 21 minutes with cold \nstorage time less than 2 hours. Here again, no functional \nassessment was possible, and success might be attributed to \nthe short warm and cold ischemic times. \nGundry then proceeded to extend the period of \nwarm ischemia to 30 minutes using a combination of \npharmacological pre- and post-conditioning agents and \nreplicated this success in a primate model, limiting cold \nstatic storage to 60 minutes (11). \nThe use of normothermic regional perfusion, originating \nfrom Barnard’s clinical work, was explored by Ali et al. using \na porcine model of hypoxic induced DCD (12). Following \ndeath, cardio-pulmonary bypass was established and after \nallowing for a period of less than hour with the heart off\ufffeloaded and allowed to recover, bypass was weaned and \nthe heart functionally assessed using load independent \ncontractility. This suggested that the DCD heart maintains \nviability and recovers function similar to that of the BSD \nheart and may be suitable for clinical transplantation. This \nwas also confirmed in the human setting where a DCD \nheart was able to be successfully weaned off normo-thrmic \nregional perfusion (NRP) and support the circulation \nsuggesting that DCD hearts were indeed functionally \nsuitable for transplantation (13). \nThe history of human DCD heart donation\nThe first adult heart transplant in the world that was \nperformed by Barnard at the Groote Schuur Hospital in \n1967 was from a DCD donor (14). The donor had been \ninvolved in a road traffic collision and sustained severe \ntraumatic brain injury. Brain stem testing was not legally \nrecognised at the time and so DCD was the only available \noption. Following WLST, the donor arrested and death was \ndeclared 5 minutes after electrical asystole. The donor was \nthen systemically heparinized and initially placed on cardio-\n\nAnnals of cardiothoracic surgery, Vol 7, No 1 January 2018 77\n© Annals of Cardiothoracic Surgery.

In this setting, the recipient \nwas co-located and the heart retrieved without cardioplegia \nfollowed by continuous antegrade coronary blood perfusion. \nHowever, following the publication of the accepted \ndefinition of brain death, heart transplantation shifted \ntowards DBD donors (15). It was only in 2004 that \nattention was drawn to the potential for DCD for cardiac \ntransplantation in the pediatric population in a bid to \nreduce the unacceptably high waiting list mortality (16). \nThe work by Gundry et al. (11) formed the basis of the \ntechniques used by the team in Denver, Colorado when \nembarking on their clinical programme of paediatric DCD \nheart transplantation (17). Here they utilized a system of \nante-mortem heparinization and cannulation, together with \nco-location of the donor and recipient. Additionally, they \nlimited the time from mechanical asystole to confirmation \nof death to 75 seconds whereas in the UK it is a mandatory \n5 minutes. These strategies were employed to decrease the \ncold ischemic time and are considered to attribute to the \nsuccess of this strategy.\nHowever, the success of these techniques relied on \nantemortem interventions and a short cold ischemic time \nwhich could only be achieved by collocating the donor and \nrecipient. Furthermore, this did not allow for functional \nassessment of the heart following the hypoxic insult of \ncirculatory death till after implantation in the recipient\nHowever, wider acceptance of DCD heart donation was \nreported in 2015 following the transplantation of three \nadult DCD hearts in Sydney using direct procurement and \nperfusion (DPP) (18). This technique involves removing \nthe asystolic heart and reanimating the organ upon an \nex-situ perfusion platform [TransMedics Organ Care \nSystem (OCS), Andover, MA, USA)] (19). Unfortunately, \nheart function could not be assessed using this technique. \nIt was therefore thought by many that without a functional \nassessment prior to transplantation this would place the \nrecipient at unacceptably high risk of primary graft failure \nas post-operative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation \n(ECMO) support was reported at 30%. This limited the \nteam to donors less than 40 years old and a donation \nwithdrawal ischemic time to less than 30 minutes.\nIn 2015, Papworth Hospital performed the world’s \nfirst DCD heart transplant using functional assessment of \nthe donor heart through the technique of normothermic \nregional perfusion. This technique allowed re-perfusion \nof the heart and abdominal viscera within the donor with \nthe exclusion of the cerebral circulation. This permitted \nfunctional assessment of the donor heart in situ allowing the \nteam to extend donor age up to 50 years and the donation \nwithdrawal ischemic time to 247 minutes.\nTechniques of DCD heart retrieval \nThere are three techniques for procurement of DCD \ncardiac allografts that are practiced in the UK: (I) \nnormothermic regional perfusion followed by ex-situ\nmachine perfusion (NRP); (II) DPP; (III) normothermic \nregional perfusion followed by cold storage.\nFollowing the planned withdrawal of life-supporting \ntherapy which is carried out by the local anesthetic or \nintensive care independent of the retrieval in the adjoining \nanesthetic room or closely situated intensive care unit, \nthe donor is monitored by the local team. Following the \nidentification of mechanical asystole, a hands-off period \nof 5 minutes is allowed prior to the declaration of death \nin keeping with the guidance in the UK as published by \nthe Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (20). Once death \nis confirmed the donor is promptly transferred to the \noperating room where the retrieval teams are scrubbed in \npreparation for organ retrieval. \nNormothermic regional perfusion\nFollowing the declaration of death, the patient is brought \ninto the operating room and draped for thoraco-abdominal \norgan retrieval. A median sternotomy is performed first \nwith prompt administration of heparin into the right atrium \nand pulmonary artery. Tracheal re-intubation is carried \nout simultaneously. The aortic arch vessels are clamped \nto exclude cerebral circulation as per the guidelines of \norgan retrieval in the UK (20). The aorta and right atrium \nare cannulated respectively to allow for NRP. Absence of \ncerebral perfusion is cross-checked with carotid Doppler. \nOnce flow via the NRP circuit is established, a laparotomy \nis performed. After a period of up to 45 minutes, during \nwhich the heart is supported by NRP and is allowed to \nrecondition, NRP is weaned. Functional assessment is then \nperformed by means of trans-oesophageal echocardiography \nand thermodilution cardiac output studies by via a \npulmonary artery flotation catheter.\nFor the instrumentation of the allograft on the \nTransMedics OCS, 1.5 L of donor blood are collected \nvia the NRP circuit to prime the OCS in addition to the \nmanufacturer provided priming solution. The heart is then \narrested with 500 mL of cold crystalloid cardioplegia (St \n\n78 Page et al. Heart transplantation from DCD\n© Annals of Cardiothoracic Surgery.

The heart is then \ncannulated for instrumentation on the OCS.\nDPP\nIn this method, a sternotomy and laparotomy are performed \nsimultaneously. Following the opening of the pericardium, \n1.5 L of donor blood is collected in a heparinised blood \ncollection bag via a cannula inserted into the right atrium to \nprime the OCS. Myocardial protection during procurement \nis achieved by the delivery of 500 mL of supplemented cold \ncrystalloid cardioplegia as described for NRP. The heart is \nthen instrumented on to the OCS in a similar fashion.\nPerfusion on the TransMedics OCS\nIn addition to the manufacturer supplied prime solution, \nthe collected donor blood is passed through a leucocyte \nfilter to make up the priming volume of the OCS as per \nthe manufacturer’s guidelines. Attention was paid to ensure \nthat donor blood collection was performed prior to the \ndelivery of cardioplegia. An additional variable infusion of \nTransMedics maintenance solution containing dextrose\ufffeinsulin and adenosine is added to the circuit along with a \nvariable infusion of adrenaline. \nThe aorta of the donor heart is cannulated to allow \nretrograde perfusion of the heart via the coronaries in the \nsetting of a competent aortic valve. The heart is drained \nvia cannulation of the pulmonary artery and a superior \npulmonary vein vent is also placed to prevent any distension \nof the left ventricle. \nAortic flow is maintained between 800–1,000 mL/min \nand the adenosine containing maintenance solution \nadjusted accordingly to maintain and aortic pressure of \n65–90 mmHg. The donor heart is paced epicardially to \na rate between 70–90 beats per minute as required. If \non reperfusion, the heart donor heart was noted to be in \nventricular fibrillation, direct current cardioversion was \nperformed to restore sinus rhythm. In addition to coronary \nflow and electrocardiographic monitoring, arterio-venous \nsamples were taken to assess lactate metabolism as a \nsurrogate for cardiac function.\nTransplantation of the DCD heart\nIrrespective of the method of DCD heart procurement \nutilised, the beating heart on the OCS was arrested with \n1 L of cold St Thomas’ cardioplegia and transplanted. \nMost transplant teams use a system of either antegrade or \nretrograde cardioplegia during implantation to further limit \nthe burden of myocardial ischemia. \nEarly results\nIn the modern era it was the paediatric transplant \ncommunity that spear-headed the revival of DCD heart \ntransplantation with the first reported case series of three \npaediatric DCD heart transplants. Since then this team \nhave reported further success and a recent review in the \nInternational Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation \nRegistry revealed a total of 21 paediatric DCD heart \ntransplants had been performed between 2005 and 2014 (21). \nReported, was a similar overall survival between infant \nDCD and DBD recipients.\nThere are currently four centres worldwide that \nhave established clinical DCD adult heart transplant \nprogrammes. Three of these centres are based in the UK—\nPapworth Hospital, Harefield Hospital and Wythenshawe \nHospital. St Vincent’s Hospital in Australia remains the \nonly adult centre outside the UK performing DCD heart \ntransplantation.\nTo date April 2017, Dhital et al. reported 12 \nDCD heart transplants all performed using the DPP \ntechnique in Sydney, Australia. At the time of writing, \nall recipients remain alive although as reported through \npersonal communication, 30% required ECMO support \npostoperatively. Donors are limited to 40 years old and the \ndonation withdrawal ischemic time limited to 30 minutes. \nPapworth Hospital practises NRP, DPP and NRP/\nCold storage. The decision for which technique to use \nremains limited by the governing body for transplantation \nin the UK, NHS Blood and Transplant who have deemed \nit such that NRP is performed only in three donor \nreferral hospitals. With 39 DCD heart transplants to date, \nPapworth Hospital has the largest DCD heart transplant \nprogramme in the world with very encouraging early \nresults. In their programme, recipient’s survival to discharge \nfollowing DCD heart transplantation is 93%, with only \n13% requiring ECMO support in the post-operative period. \nRecipients required a median stay of 5 days in intensive care \nwith a median stay of 20 days in hospital. \nThere is debate as to which technique of procurement is \nsuperior. The Sydney group, based on their experimental \nwork (22), limit the time allowed from WLST to declaration \nof death to be eligible for DCD heart donation to 30 minutes. \n\nAnnals of cardiothoracic surgery, Vol 7, No 1 January 2018 79\n© Annals of Cardiothoracic Surgery. All rights reserved. www.annalscts.com Ann Cardiothorac Surg 2018;7(1):75-81\nThe use of NRP allowing for a comprehensive functional \nassessment of cardiac function with data obtained \nfrom the pulmonary floatation catheter (PAFC) and \ntrans-oesophageal echocardiography has allowed for \nthis relatively short interval to be extended without \ncompromising transplant outcomes (19). Additionally, the \nconfidence provided by functional assessment has allowed \nfor the inclusion of older donors, thus further expanding \nthe potential donor pool. An early review describing the \ninternational experience of DCD heart transplantation to\ufffedate, highlighted that there was no significant difference in \nmortality between the two techniques (21). However, from \na health-economics perspective, it did highlight that the \npercentage conversion of hearts perfused on the OCS that \nproceeded to transplantation was higher in those who had \nbeen assessed on NRP, allowing for a significant cost-saving. \nMore recently, a timely study published by Messer et al.\ncoinciding with the 50th anniversary of heart transplantation \nfurther confirms these findings (23). More importantly, \nthey address the question of transplant outcomes of DCD \nhearts in comparison to the current gold-standard of DBD \nheart transplants. In a matched comparison, they found \nno significant difference in survival with a reported 92% \n90-day survival in the DCD group (n=26) with no \ndifferences in intensive care duration, length of hospital stay \nor the need for mechanical support. Interestingly, they did \nreport better early cardiac function of the DCD allografts \ncompared with the matched DBD cohort.\nEthical considerations\nThe use of NRP is not possible in certain countries due \nto the many varying legal definitions of death that exist \nglobally. In the UK, current practice is based on the code \nof practice guidelines published by the Academy of Medical \nRoyal Colleges (20). These guidelines allow for the use \nof NRP and for perfusion of the heart to be restarted \nwithin the donor provided that cerebral circulation is not \nrestored. There are other legislative differences that exist \nin the process of declaration of death internationally. In the \nUK, a period of 5 minutes after mechanical asystole has \nto be allowed prior to the declaration of death, whereas in \nAustralia this time period varies between 3 to 5 minutes \nand in the paediatric cohort in Colorado was reduced to \n75 seconds. Furthermore, the use of ante-mortem \ninterventions such as ante-mortem heparin, while \nroutinely practiced for DCD retrievals in some countries is \nunacceptable in the UK. \nCo-location of the donor and recipient, while an \nexceptionally rare occurrence, has been intentionally \nemployed to facilitate paediatric DCD transplantation (17). \nHowever, this is not a strategy that is routinely acceptable \nin many other countries on ethical and logistic grounds \ndespite the proposed clinical benefits. \nFuture work\nAlthough DCD heart transplantation has been shown \nto be a viable source of good quality donor hearts, there \nremains a lot of work that needs to be done to optimise \nthis resource and allow patients to fully benefit from this \nprocedure. Significant work has already been done in \nusing post-conditioning agents on an ex-situ platform of \nperfusion to allow for better post-transplant outcome using \npharmacological agents which has already translated into \nclinical practice (24). However, apart from using NRP, \nthere remains significant doubt on the reliability of organ \nassessment on the OCS which is currently based on the \nuse of lactate as a surrogate for organ quality together \nwith flow parameters (25,26). Additionally, as with DBD \ntransplantation, primary graft dysfunction (PGD) remains \nan issue and the platform of ex-situ perfusion allows for an \nopportunity to investigate potential bio-markers that may \nbe used to predict PGD and indeed advise on organ quality. \nAlthough DCD heart transplantation has relied heavily \non ex-situ organ perfusion where normothermia was \nthe preferred strategy (27), there are a number of heart \nperfusion devices currently being developed which may \noffer an alternative strategy to preservation of the DCD \nheart (28). \nConclusions\nThe results of the established DCD heart transplant \nprogrammes provide a strong case for DCD heart \ntransplantation to be incorporated into existing heart \ntransplant programmes worldwide. As experience grows, it \nwill be important to follow the long-term outcomes of these \npioneering programmes and promote wider adoption of this \nvaluable resource for donor hearts for the ever-increasing \nnumber of patients with heart failure. However, we can say \nwith increasing confidence that the current experience with \nDCD hearts has thus far proven to provide heart failure \npatients with at least equivalent outcomes to DBD heart \ntransplantation. Additionally, the conservative estimates \nfor the potential for DCD heart transplantation to increase \n\n80 Page et al. Heart transplantation from DCD\n© Annals of Cardiothoracic Surgery.

Despite it \nbeing 50 years since the first DCD heart transplant, the \nuse of DCD hearts with distant procurement and isolated \nheart perfusion is in its infancy, and further research is \nrequired into defining the limits of this technique as well \nas mechanisms for optimising DCD hearts. With further \ndevelopments in attenuating ischemic insults using pre- and \npost-conditioning strategies we may be able to extend the \ntime limits and even allow for organ repair. The platform \nfor isolated heart perfusion provides us with a unique \nopportunity to investigate heart assessment, donor-recipient \nmatching and organ preservation. This future for heart \ntransplantation and organ donation may not only be limited \ngeographical boundaries but a global service to our patients. \nAcknowledgements\nOur study was supported by the Papworth Charity and the \nNHS Blood and Transplant authority.\nFootnote\nConflicts of Interest: The authors have no conflicts of interest \nto declare.\nReferences\n1.

The authors describe the historical background of DCD heart transplantation, starting with the first successful transplant in 1967, and highlight the challenges and limitations of this type of donation. The article explains the differences between DCD and traditional donation after brain death (DBD) and explores the reasons behind the lower usage rate of DCD donors. The authors also outline the various techniques used for DCD heart retrieval, including normothermic regional perfusion (NRP), direct procurement and perfusion (DPP), and normothermic regional perfusion followed by cold storage. The article emphasizes the importance of functional assessment of the donor heart before transplantation and notes that the current techniques allow for donor ages up to 50 years and withdrawal times up to 247 minutes. The authors conclude by stating that further research is needed to define the limits of DCD heart transplantation and optimize the procedure. Overall, the article highlights the potential benefits of DCD heart transplantation, such as reducing waiting list mortality rates, but also acknowledges the challenges and limitations that still exist. The authors call for continued research and development in this area.",1.0,0.8067102913040841,FULL_PAPER
What are the current research/knowledge gaps in standardizing perfusion protocols?,"[""R E S EAR CH A R TIC L E Open Access\nLiver transplantation in Jehovah’s\nwitnesses: 13 consecutive cases at a single\ninstitution\nDiego Costanzo1\n, Maria Bindi1\n, Davide Ghinolfi2\n, Massimo Esposito1\n, Francesco Corradi1\n, Francesco Forfori1\n,\nPaolo De Simone2\n, Andrea De Gasperi3 and Gianni Biancofiore1*\nAbstract\nBackground: Jehovah’s Witnesses represent a tremendous clinical challenge when indicated to liver transplantation\nbecause they refuse blood transfusion on religious grounds and the procedure is historically associated with\npotential massive peri-operative blood loss. We herein describe a peri-operative management pathway with\nstrategies toward a transfusion-free environment with the aim not only of offering liver transplant to selected\nJehovah’s Witnesses patients but also, ultimately, of translating this practice to all general surgical procedures.\nMethods: This is a retrospective review of prospective medical records of JW patients who underwent LT at\nour Institution. The peri-operative multimodal strategy to liver transplantation in Jehovah’s Witnesses includes\na pre-operative red cell mass optimization package and the intra-operative use of normovolemic haemodilution, veno\ufffevenous bypass and low central venous pressure.\nResults: In a 9-year period, 13 Jehovah’s Witness patients received liver transplantation at our centre representing the\nlargest liver transplant program from deceased donors in Jehovah’s Witnesses patients reported so far. No patient\nreceived blood bank products but 3 had fibrinogen concentrate and one tranexamic acid to correct ongoing hyper\ufffefibrinolysis. There were 4 cases of acute kidney injury (one required extracorporeal renal replacement treatment) and\none patient needed vasoactive medications to support blood pressure for the first 2 postoperative days. Two patients\nunderwent re-laparotomy. Finally, of the 13 recipients, 12 were alive at the 1 year follow-up interview and 1 died due\nto septic complications.\nConclusions: Our experience confirms that liver transplantation in selected Jehovah’s Witnesses patients can be feasible\nand safe provided that it is carried out at a very experienced centre and according to a multidisciplinary approach.\nKeywords: Liver transplantation, Jehovah witnesses, Bloodless medicine and surgery programs; strategies, Transfusion\ufffealternative\nBackground\nThe religion of Jehovah’s Witnesses (JW) was founded\nin the nineteenth century and its community counts\nabout 250.000 members in Italy (https://www.jw.org/it/\ntestimoni-di-geova/nel-mondo/IT). Liver transplantation\n(LT) is the only therapeutic option for patients with\nend-stage liver disease (ESLD) or acute liver failure and\nits outcomes markedly improved over the last decades\n[1]. Since the risk of life-threatening peri-operative\nbleeding in LT remains considerable and JW refuse\nblood transfusion on religious grounds, they always rep\uffferesented a tremendous clinical challenge and generated\nethical and legal concerns when indicated to this proced\ufffeure [2]. At the University of Pisa, Azienda Ospedaliera\ufffeUniversitaria Pisana, we developed a peri-operative man\ufffeagement pathway with strategies toward a transfusion\ufffefree environment with the aim not only of offering LT\nto selected JW patients but also, ultimately, of translat\ufffeing this practice to all general surgical procedures.

The study was approved by the local\nethical committee, Comitato Etico Area Vasta Nord\nOvest, Pisa (Nr 1552; 03/08/2018).\nPreoperative management\nJW patients were evaluated as per our standard Institu\ufffetional clinical protocol. For this particular class of patients,\ntwo or more indicators of severe portal hypertension\n(platelets < 50 × 103 μL, grade 3 esophageal varices, ascites,\nprevious variceal hemorrhage and hepatic encephalop\ufffeathy) were considered contraindications for listing [3] as\nwell as INR > 2.5 and stage 2 kidney injury according to\nthe AKIN classification. Patients were deactivated from\nthe list if, due to worsening of their clinical condition, they\nfell outside these criteria. Patients with previous upper ab\ufffedominal surgery and UNOS status 1 and 2 were also ex\ufffecluded. Once indicated to LT and provided that involved\nsenior surgeons and anesthesiologists agreed to perform\nthe procedure, patients were requested to attend two in\ufffeterviews: one in presence of the next of kin and a JW elder\nand one alone with our centre’s clinical leadership. All pa\ufffetients were required to sign a consent form that reflected\ntheir wishes formally refusing the use of blood products\neven in case of life-threatening anemia and stating the ac\ufffecepted therapies. In fact, since acceptance of blood frac\ufffetions by JW depends on patient’s free will apart from\nchurch doctrine [4], there are some therapies that all JW\nrefuse (whole homologous blood and its main fractions:\nplasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and\npreoperative storage of autologous blood for later use dur\ufffeing surgery) whereas there are some other treatments that\nmost, but not all, Witnesses accept (perioperative blood\nsalvage; products derived from the main components of\nblood, such as albumin, clotting factors, antithrombin III,\nsynthetic hemoglobin, autotransplantation of stem cells,\ntransplant of solid organs, normovolemic hemodilution).\nFinally, some other therapies are accepted by all Wit\ufffenesses: plasma substitutes, which are not derived from\nblood, erythropoietin and hemopoietic agents obtained\nfrom genetic recombination [4]. Therefore, all of the\nJW candidate to LT received detailed and written in\ufffeformation about each of the available therapies. Fol\ufffelowing admission to the waiting list, patients showing an\nHemoglobin (Hb) level < 12 mg/dL underwent\nhematological consultation in the aim to optimize their\nred cell mass. We developed a preoperative protocol for\nJW candidates to LT which includes supplementation\nwith iron or vitamin (vitamin B12, folic acid) and subcuta\ufffeneous recombinant erythropoietin (40.000 IU weekly).\nThe hematological package inserts also monthly labora\ufffetory checks and interviews in order to adjust treatments.\nTransplant candidates with Hb > 12 mg/dL were moni\ufffetored with regular laboratory checks and, if necessary, they\nwere included in the optimization protocol.\nIntra-operative management\nStandard anesthetic management was used as already re\ufffeported [5]. During hepatectomy and the anhepatic phase\n(the time from the physical removal of the native liver\nuntil the revascularization of the graft), patients were\nmanaged by the attending anesthetist aiming at a low cen\ufffetral venous pressure (CVP), ideally ≤5 mmHg, by restrict\ufffeive volume infusion. Intra-operative cell salvage (ICS) and\nacute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) were adopted\nwhenever feasible. The ICS (Cell Saver 4, Haemonetics\nCorporation, Braintree, MA, USA; Dideco Electa; Sorin\nGroup, Miradola, Italy) was used in all procedures and its\ncircuit was maintained in continuity with patient’s circula\ufffetion. The volume of red cells returned to patients from\nICS was used as an estimation of intra-operative bleeding\n[6]. For the purposes of ANH, we contraindicated it in pa\ufffetients with Hematocrit (Hct) < 35%, platelets count <\n100.000 and INR > 1.5. In case of ANH, blood was re\ufffemoved from a central line by gravity and drained to a\ncitrate-phosphate-dextrose (CPD) bag after anesthesia in\ufffeduction with the patient’s intravascular volume being\nmaintained by infusion of crystalloid solutions. The CPD\ntubing remained connected to the patient at all times con\ufffeforming to the patients’ religious beliefs. Hypothermia was\nlimited by the use of forced air warmer blankets and intra\ufffevenous fluids warmers. All LTs were performed using the\nconventional surgical technique with vena cava replace\ufffement and veno-venous bypass. Coagulation profiles were\ntracked using rotational thromboelastography and pa\ufffetients’ approved component therapies were administered\naccordingly. Finally, experienced surgeons and anesthetists\nwere in charge of all cases.\nPost-operative management\nAfter surgery, all patients remained under observation in\nthe ICU and then transferred to the regular ward. Opti\ufffemal basic conditions for coagulation was ensured and\nantifibrinolytic treatment was initiated early if needed. In\ncase of sub-optimal oxygenation, general anesthesia, in\ufffetubation and hyperoxic ventilation were considered\nearly. Post-operative cell salvage of drainage blood was\nimplemented in case of massive production and surgical\nre-intervention was considered immediately in case of\nworsening anemia. Laboratory tests were reduced to a\nminimum and, if necessary, performed with low volume\nCostanzo et al. BMC Anesthesiology (2020) 20:31 Page 2 of 7\n\nblood sampling systems. Postoperativelly, erythropoiesis\nwas stimulated when needed following the same criteria\nand protocol used for pre-OLT preparation.\nStatistical analysis\nResults are reported as median [IQR]. One-way analysis\nof variance (ANOVA) with Tuckey’s correction for mul\ufffetiple comparisons was used for statistical analysis and\nthe significance was set at p < 0.05. Data analysis was\nperformed using GraphPad Prism (version 7.00 for\nWindows, GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).\nResults\nSince 2007, 16 JW patients were considered for LT at\nour Institution: 3 of them showed more that 2 indicators\nof severe portal hypertension and were not admitted to\nthe transplant whereas the other 13 were listed and re\ufffeceived a graft from a deceased donor. Age at the time of\nLT was 51 [44.5–57.5] years with a BMI of 23.7 [20.8–\n26.9] kg/m2. MELD score, the scoring system for assessing\nthe severity of chronic liver disease [7], was 15 [12–22]\nand the diseases indicating LT were post infection liver\ncirrhosis (n = 8, 61.5%) which was associated with hepato\ufffecellular carcinoma in the 75% of cases (n = 6), alcoholic\ncirrhosis (n = 2, 15.4%), primary biliary cirrhosis (n = 1,\n7.7%), alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (n = 1, 7.7%) and\nhemochromatosis (n = 1, 7.7%), (Table 1). One patient was\nthalassemic and another had a previous transjugular intra\ufffehepatic portosystemic shunt due to repeated variceal\nbleeding. Waiting time before LT was 189 [58.5–390.5]\ndays. Graft’s cold and warm ischemia times were 460\n[425.5 to 528.5] and 74 [68–86.5] minutes respectively\nand total surgery duration was 435 [420 to 450] minutes.\nPatients Hct at the time of listing was 38.5 [35.1–42.3] %\nwith an hemoglobin level of 12.8 [11.8–15.4] mg/dL. Two\npatients needed red cell mass optimization and the\ntargeted Hct was achieved within 2 months. All of the\ntransplanted patients agreed to receive AHN, ICS and, in\ncase of need, coagulation factors concentrates and fibrino\ufffegen concentrate. A comprehensive report of patients\nhematologic profile is reported in Table 2 whereas Table 3\nshows individual data. ANH was performed in 6 patients\nwith 3 [2.7–3] retrieved Units. The volume of red cells\nreturned to patients from ICS was 400 [217–720] mL. No\npatient received blood bank products, 3 had fibrinogen\nconcentrate 2 g and one also needed 2 g tranexamic acid\nto correct ongoing hyper-fibrinolysis. The amount of\nfluids infused during surgery was 3560 [3425–4300] mL,\nall balanced crystalloid solutions.

In both\ncases patients did not show signs of coagulopathy and did\nnot receive transfusions. One patient developed an urinary\ntract infection on POD #5 due to Escherichia coli. Finally,\nof the 13 JW recipients, 12 (92.3%) were alive at the 1 year\nfollow-up interview: 1 patient died 11 months from LT\ndue to ischemic-type biliary lesions (ITBL)-related septic\ncomplications.\nDiscussion\nTwo key factors led us in deciding to offer LT to JW pa\ufffetients. The first was our large experience in the proced\ufffeure. In fact, we transplanted our first JW patient in\n2007, 11 years and 930 procedures from the start of our\nLT program in 1996. The second was the rate of blood\ufffeless LT characterizing our activity in the years prior to\nthat decision [5]. In our experience, a careful selection of\nrecipients was a key-player as we decided to admit JW\npatients to the pre-LT screening only if they did not\nshow indicators of severe portal hypertension since\nbleeding in LT is predominantly linked to portal hyper\ufffetension rather than primary coagulopathy [8–12]. Thus,\nearly referral and careful timing for listing is highly\ndesirable in these patients. Predicting cases requiring\nperi-operative transfusions is very desirable, particularly\nin JW patients, but it remains a very difficult task in LT\n[8, 11, 12]. In fact, despite several investigations have\nattempted to identify preoperative predictors of blood\ntransfusion, their value remain inconsistent and weak\n[2, 8–14]. In recent years, models to predict blood\nutilization with preoperative variables have been pro\ufffeposed [11, 14, 15]. However, their limitations and dif\ufffeferences in the results highlight significant concerns\nabout their generalizability and recognize that it may\nbe very difficult to develop a single, reliable, and uni\ufffeversally applicable model to predict transfusion re\ufffequirements for patients undergoing LT. In our series,\nthe use of techniques that minimize blood loss played\na major role. The adoption of a fluid restriction pol\ufffeicy and low CVP is important as it results helpful in\ndecreasing blood transfusion requirements during LT\n[8, 16]. In fact, liberal volume loading in cirrhotic pa\ufffetients tends to pool in the splanchnic circulation with\nminimal improvement in cardiac preload or output\nbut increased risk of surgical bleeding because of con\ufffegestion of the portal circulation [9, 10, 15]. Moreover,\ndilution of clotting factors and clot disturbance can\nresult, particularly if colloids are used [2, 13]. Further,\nlowering the pressure in the central veins can help in\nminimizing blood loss also because it may augment\nvenous drainage from the liver, encouraging flow of blood\naway from the surgical field [9–12]. Other intra-operative\nblood conservation strategies can be important to achieve\ntransfusion-free surgery. In our JW patients we performed\nANH but only in selected patients in order not to exces\ufffesively dilute clotting factors, including PLT. Finally, in the\nview of a multimodal strategy aimed at reducing blood\nloss [9], we used in all cases the veno-venous bypass to\nminimize the impact of mesenteric congestion and ab\ufffedominal bleeding during portal and caval cross-clamping\n[17]. In case of peri-operative coagulopathy, since JW will\nnot accept fresh frozen plasma or platelets, the use of co\ufffeagulation factor concentrates and/or tranexamic acid\nguided by rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM®) or\nthrombelastography (TEG™) [8–11] should be considered.\nTherefore, the use of fibrinogen concentrate (which can\nsupport fibrin clotting without transfusion of PLT), clot\ufffeting factors concentrates and tranexamic acid should be\nexplained and proposed to these patients in the consider\ufffeation that acceptance of blood fractions by JW depends\non patient’s free will, apart from church doctrine [4, 13].\nRegarding the use of recombinant erythropoietin to\noptimize red cell mass, it has a number of potential bene\ufffefits. The most obvious is that patients will start LT with a\nhigher blood Hb level that, besides enabling use of ANH\n[9, 10], correlates with peri-operative low or no use of red\nblood cells transfusion [2, 18]. Since erythropoietin’s use\nwas associated to a possible risk of thromboembolism\n[18], we performed regular clinical and laboratory moni\ufffetoring of LT candidates on erythropoietin treatment also\nin consideration that the waiting time for a suitable de\ufffeceased donor is unpredictable. The use of ICS in patients\nwith hepatocellular carcinoma could be discussed because\nof the potential risk of infusing malignant cells into pa\ufffetients. To date, 4 studies have evaluated the oncological\nsafety of using ICS in LT. One concluded that the device\nis effective in removing malignant cells from the aspirate,\nexcept in cases of tumor rupture whereas the other 3,\nevaluating clinical outcomes such as mortality and recur\uffference, did not demonstrate negative effects associated with\nthe use of ICS [19]. On the contrary, the use of cell salvage\nduring LT for hepatocellular carcinoma has been found to\nreduce the exposure to allogeneic blood and to be cost\ufffeeffective [20]. In summary, also according to the most re\ufffecent guidelines [21], despite theoretical risks and benefits,\nthere is no conclusive evidence that ICS can induce me\ufffetastases or affect cancer prognosis. The theoretical risk of\ninducing metastatic spread (unproven) is offset by reduced\nallogeneic transfusion and immunomodulation, which is\nproven [21]. During the last decade, blood product re\ufffequirements in LT patients have significantly decreased in\nmost centres. This improvement was related to different\nfactors including better surgical techniques, LT indication\nand liver graft preservation techniques [8–11]. Also,\nCostanzo et al. BMC Anesthesiology (2020) 20:31 Page 5 of 7\n\nexperience of the surgical and anesthesiological team is\nimportant. In particular, surgical experience and skill dur\ufffeing hepatic dissection and meticulous hemostasis has long\nbeen recognized as meaningful in determining the amount\nof intraoperative blood loss [22].\nHowever, experience is difficult to quantify and many\nunforeseen intraoperative events with the potential oc\ufffecurrence of technical difficulties impart complex changes\npredisposing to extensive bleeding. Furthermore¸ there\nis evidence that transfusional requirements can be re\ufffeduced if the anesthesia team followed protocols includ\ufffeing goal-directed transfusion practices [23]. However,\ncomparison of intraoperative transfusion requirements\nfrom different transplant centers may be inherently\nbiased by an inability to account for differences in trans\ufffefusion triggers and clinical practices. Consequently, the\npredictive models developed in one institution may\nhardly, if ever, be applicable in others.\nFew other cases of LT in JW have been reported so far\nand, since the first one ever in 1994 [24], our series is, to\nthe best of our knowledge, the second most numerous\noverall and the largest from deceased donors. In fact,\nJabbour and colleagues from University of Southern\nCalifornia reported in 2005 the results of 27 consecutive\nLT in JW patients, 19 from living and only 8 from de\ufffeceased donors whereas Detry and colleagues reported 6\ncases from Liege in Belgium [6, 25]. Other smaller case\nseries are available from different countries [26–28].\nIt is undeniable that a rather diffused concern exists\nabout offering LT to JW patients. In fact, the acceptance\nof solid organ transplantation and contemporary refusal\nof transfusion are hardly understandable for non-JW.\nHowever, it is important to remember that, as far as\norgan transplants are concerned, each Witness is called\non to decide personally whether to accept them or not,\nwith the proviso that no part of the transplantation\nprocess may include the use of blood or its main frac\ufffetions [4, 13]. Therefore, each JW patient should be inter\ufffeviewed individually excluding external pressure and the\nuse of every available peri-operative option aimed at a\nblood sparing management, including the use of factors\nand fibrinogen concentrates, should be carefully dis\ufffecussed and clarified. Since our patients have been trans\ufffeplanted over a period of 10 years, it could be argued that\nperi-operative management policies could have changed\nduring this period with a possible effect of time on re\ufffesults. However, no substantial changes in clinical care of\nrecipients were made during the considered period and\nthere was also consistency in anesthesiology and peri\ufffeoperative treatments.\nConclusion\nWe herein presented the results of the largest LT pro\ufffegram from deceased donors in JW patients that has been\nreported so far. Our experience shows that the risk-to\ufffebenefits ratio of LT can be maintained in selected adult\nJW patients provided that it is carried out at a very expe\uffferienced centre and according to a multidisciplinary ap\ufffeproach. We reported our experience in the aim to offer\na template for a broader concept of transfusion-free sur\ufffegery principles rather than as a focus on a technical\nachievement in such a complicated clinical setting. An\ufffeesthesiologists, as users of blood products, are called to\nlead a continuous re-evaluation process aimed at defin\ufffeing the most proficient approach to bloodless surgery\nand at contributing to the debate about benchmarking\nin difficult clinical scenarios.\nAbbreviations\nAHN: Acute normovolemic hemodilution; CPD: Citrate-phosphate-dextrose;\nCVP: Central venous pressure; ESLD: End-stage liver disease; Hb: Hemoglobin;\nHt: Hematocrit; ICS: Intra-operative cell salvage; ICU: Intensive care unit;\nJW: Jehovah’s Witnesses; LT: Liver transplantation\nAcknowledgements\nNone.\nAuthors’ contributions\nDC: data collection; LMB: study design, drafting of the manuscript; DG: data\nanalysis, drafting and reviewing of the manuscript; ME: data collection; PDS\nand FF: drafting of the manuscript; FC: data collection and elaboration; AdG:\ndrafting the manuscript; GB: study design, data analysis, drafting and reviewing\nof the manuscript.

The study analyzes the experiences of 13 patients who refused blood products based on their religious beliefs. The results show that none of the patients received blood products, while three patients required fibrinogen concentrate and one required tranexamic acid. Acute kidney injury occurred in four patients, and two required intraoperative reperfusion syndrome. The study highlights the importance of developing a transfusion-free strategy for liver transplantation in Jehovah's Witnesses through a multidisciplinary team effort involving anesthesiologists, surgeons, and hematologists. The authors suggest that further studies should focus on identifying effective alternatives to blood products and improving the understanding of the risks and benefits of blood product avoidance in liver transplantation. The study emphasizes the need for collaboration among healthcare professionals to ensure safe and effective liver transplantation for Jehovah's Witnesses who refuse blood products. The authors recommend that future research should explore the effectiveness of alternative methods for managing blood loss during liver transplantation in Jehovah's Witnesses. Overall, the study provides insights into the challenges and opportunities associated with blood product avoidance in liver transplantation for Jehovah's Witnesses.",0.6428571428571429,0.7915764273145154,FULL_PAPER
