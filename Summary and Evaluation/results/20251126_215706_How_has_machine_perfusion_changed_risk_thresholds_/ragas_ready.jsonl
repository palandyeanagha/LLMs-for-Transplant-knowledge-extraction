Rapidly increasing\ndemands for LT have also caused severe shortage of donor liver\norgans in clinical application. To overcome this discrepancy,\ndonation after circulatory death (DCD), extended criteria donors\n(ECDs), living liver donation, or marginal liver grafts are\nincreasingly accepted to expand the limited donor pool. However,\nstudies have suggested that these additional liver donation\nsources often suffered from longer warm ischemic periods and\nworse ischemia–reperfusion injury (IRI) during LT, resulting\nin increased risk of early allograft dysfunction (EAD), primary\nnonfunction (PNF), biliary complications, and poorer long-term\ngraft and patient survival (1).\nDuring transplantation, the quality of donor liver preservation\nis an important factor on maintaining and improving transplant\noutcomes of patients. Standard static cold storage (CS)\nremains the gold standard method for liver graft preservation.\nNevertheless, the effectiveness of CS preservation is currently\nunable to provide sufficient protection of liver grafts against IRI,\nespecially for prolonged CS of DCD and marginal livers, often\nresulting in increased risk of EAD, PNF, and biliary complications\n(2). As an alternative preservation strategy, machine perfusion\n(MP) can provide a continuous circulation of metabolic\nsubstrates and antioxidants, imitating the physiological processes\nwhile flushing inflammatory cytokine and toxins from the graft.\nTherefore, MP has been proposed as a better strategy to protect or\nrescue marginal liver grafts by attenuating the cytokine mediated\nIRI (3).\nMachine perfusion has been widely used for preservation\nin kidney transplantation. Plenty of evidence suggested MP’s\npriority in improving early graft function, reducing the risk of\ndelayed graft function (DGF), and enhancing ECD graft survival\nafter renal transplantation (4). Unlike kidney transplantation,\nMP remained relatively limited in clinical LTs due to the high\nmetabolism rates of liver, relatively complicated perfusion system\nAbbreviations: AST, aspartate aminotransferase; ALT, alanine transaminase; CI,\nconfidence interval; CS, cold storage; DBD, deceased brain donor; DCD, donor\nafter cardiac death; EAD, early allograft dysfunction; ECD, extended criteria\ndonors; HAT, hepatic artery thrombosis; HMP, hypothermic machine perfusion;\nHOPE, hypothermic oxygenated perfusion; IRI, ischemia–reperfusion injury; IC,\nischemic cholangiopathy; LT, liver transplantation; MP, machine perfusion; MELD,\nmodel for end-stage liver disease; NOS, Newcastle–Ottawa Quality Assessment\nScale; NMP, normothermic machine perfusion; OR:odds ratio; PNF, primary\nnonfunction; PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta￾Analysis.\nconsisting of hepatic and portal route, poor practicality, and\nhigh costs.\nLarge animal and human experimental studies have suggested\nthat MP may provide better protection of liver grafts against\nIRI than CS (5, 6).

These organs are known to function poorly if\ntransplanted but make up a significant portion of the available pool of donated livers. This\nstudy demonstrates the ability to improve the function of steatotic rat livers using a combina￾tion of ex situ machine perfusion and a “defatting” drug cocktail. After 6 hours of perfusion,\ndefatted livers demonstrated lower perfusate lactate levels and improved bile quality as\ndemonstrated by higher bile bicarbonate and lower bile lactate. Furthermore, defatting was\nassociated with decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased\nexpression of enzymes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Rehabilitation of mar￾ginal or discarded steatotic livers using machine perfusion and tailored drug therapy can sig￾nificantly increase the supply of donor livers for transplantation.\nIntroduction\nLiver transplantation remains the only cure for end-stage liver disease. However, there contin￾ues to be a significant organ shortage with approximately 14, 000 patients on the waitlist and\n8,000 liver transplants performed annually [1]. Central to the donor organ shortage is the high\ndiscard rate of procured or potentially procurable organs, with nearly 3,000 livers discarded\nper year [2]. As a result of the obesity epidemic in the United States and Europe, nearly half of\nprocured livers are discarded due to excessive macrosteatosis related to non-alcoholic fatty\nliver disease (NAFLD) [3].\nPLOS ONE\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0232886 May 12, 2020 1 / 19\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Raigani S, Carroll C, Griffith S, Pendexter\nC, Rosales I, Deirawan H, et al.

As a result,\ntransplantation of livers with moderate (30–60%) or severe (>60%) macrosteatosis is associ￾ated with increased early allograft dysfunction (EAD) or primary non-function, and decreased\nlong-term graft survival [5, 6]. Further contributing to IRI is acute-on-chronic oxidative stress,\ncompromised hepatic microcirculation, and an inability to recover from an energy-depleted\nstate [7–10].\nThe application of ex situ machine perfusion technology to liver resuscitation and rehabili￾tation has not only decreased the organ discard rate, but expanded the ability to use marginal,\nextended criteria, or even discarded livers for transplantation without compromising patient\nand graft survival [11, 12]. Using machine perfusion as a platform for targeted intervention\npaves the way for salvage of otherwise discarded organs for potential transplantation. One\napplication of this technology involves salvaging steatotic livers. Over 10 year ago, our group\nreported for the first time in the literature a combination of agents capable of “defatting” and\nreversing key biochemical deficiencies in steatotic hepatocytes in culture [13–15]. Boteon and\ncolleagues recently showed that the same cocktail decreases fat content and improves perfu￾sion parameters in discarded steatotic human livers [16]. However, the safety and utility of sev￾eral components of the cocktail have not been confirmed or have been abandoned for human\nclinical use [17]. We therefore performed a mechanistic study in a rat liver perfusion model to\nidentify pathways targeted by these agents, with the ultimate goal of replacing them with agents\ndeveloped in the interim 10 years that are safe for human clinical use.\nMethods\nPreparation of perfusate\nBaseline (plain) perfusate consisted of high-glucose Dulbecco’s Minimum Eagles’ Medium\nsupplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum, 2% v/v penicillin-streptomycin, and 3% w/v\nbovine serum albumin. The original development of the defatting cocktail in vitro [13, 14] and\nits subsequent cytotoxicity testing in cell culture models [15] have been previously described.\nDefatting cocktail agents include 10 uM forskolin, 1uM GW7647, 1uM GW501516, 10 uM\nscoparone, 10 uM hypericin, 0.4 ng/ml visfatin, 0.8 mM L-carnitine, and additional amino\nacids [13, 14]. Defatting perfusate consisted of plain perfusate supplemented with defatting\ncocktail. Perfusate and cocktail component details are provided in the Supplemental Methods\nin S1 File.\nIsolated liver perfusion\nLean (Fa/fa) and obese (fa/fa) male Zucker rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA)\naged 12–16 weeks and group housed in pairs in a conventional room under standard condi￾tions (21ºC room temperature, 12-hour light/dark cycles, mixed paper/cellulose bedding).\nRats had free access to standard chow and autoclaved water.

After induction of anesthesia with\n3–5% isoflurane, a transverse laparotomy was made. The common bile duct was partially tran￾sected, cannulated with 28-gauge PTFE tubing, and secured with 4–0 silk sutures. 0.3 mL of\n1000U/mL heparin was injected into the inferior vena cava (IVC) and after 3 minutes of circu￾lation, the hepatic artery was ligated with 7–0 silk. Next, the portal vein was cannulated with a\n16-gauge catheter, followed immediately by transection of the IVC. The liver was then flushed\nslowly with 50 mL of ice-cold 0.9% saline via the portal cannula while the rat was simulta￾neously euthanized by exsanguination under isoflurane gas anesthesia.

There were 126 livers suitable for the\ntrial, with steatosis being the leading cause of organ discard with 78 (42%) offers. Stringent donor inclusion criteria were not met in 25 (14%) offers and on\n21 (11%) occasions the research team was already committed to the perfusion of another study liver. A liver was considered for the trial only if it could be\nallocated to a consented, potential blood group- and size-matched low-risk recipient. Many recipients were apprehensive to participate in such a high-risk\nclinical trial, and as a consequence, at any given time there were usually only one to three patients consented. A significant proportion of approached\npatients declined to take part, or were transplanted with a standard quality liver before agreeing to take part in this study. Eventually, thirty-one livers were\nenroled to the trial, of which 22 (71%) grafts met the viability criteria and were successfully transplanted. b A summary of reasons for livers being\ndiscarded in the United Kingdom between November 2016 and February 2018. A total of 64 livers were discarded for severe steatosis on visual\nassessment, with 14 discarded for severe steatosis based on urgent liver biopsy. A percentage of livers were declined due to intra-abdominal or lung\nmalignancies (e.g. colonic cancer in donor 22). This did not include primary brain tumours or small renal cell cancers which are almost always considered\nfor donation. The reasons for logistic discard, include the transplant team already being committed to one or more transplantations, lack of a suitable\nrecipient or too long an anticipated cold ischaemia time due to delays with transportation.\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16251-3 ARTICLE\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2020) 11:2939 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16251-3 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 3", "24.

However, it re￾mains cryptic why the multitude of these observational\nstudies generate such a diversity of findings when it comes\nto predicting postreperfusion syndrome. Prospective multi￾center trials, the creation of an LT register or meta-analyses\ninvestigating the prediction of PRS could help to shed light\non this matter in the future.\nThe increasing number of liver transplantations has led\nto an increased demand of donor organs [1] and to the\ngrowing use of organs from extended criteria donors (ECD)\n[23]. A common quality marker for organs is fatty change,\nor steatosis. Steatosis has indeed been linked to the occur￾rence of PRS [8, 16]. Studies have shown that transplant￾ation of liver grafts with moderate to severe steatosis can\nvery well be conducted without sacrificing recipient survival\nbut in particular, that increased efforts are needed when\ndealing with these organs [26, 38]. However, macroscopic\nassessment of the organ may not be qualified to assess\nsteatosis: Rey and colleagues have examined 36 livers of\norgan donors which were explanted but not allocated.\nFig. 3 Clinical chemistry.

The study included 2 stages: in the first stage, 25 livers were ran￾domised into static cold storage (n = 7), hepatic artery HMP (n = 10), and non-oxygen￾supplemented portal vein HMP (n = 8). In the second stage, 20 livers were randomised into\noxygen-supplemented and non-oxygen-supplemented portal vein HMP (n = 11 and 9,\nrespectively). Changes in dynamic, biochemical, and morphologic parameters during 4-\nhour preservation were compared between perfusion groups, and between potentially trans￾plantable and non-transplantable livers.\nResults\nDuring arterial perfusion, resistance was higher and flow was lower than venous perfusion\n(p = 0.001 and 0.01, respectively); this was associated with higher perfusate markers\nduring arterial perfusion (p>0.05). Supplementary oxygen did not cause a significant alter￾ation in the studied parameters. Morphology was similar between static and dynamic\npreservation groups. Perfusate markers were 2 fold higher in non-transplantable livers\n(p>0.05).\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0203803 September 14, 2018 1 / 12\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Abudhaise H, Davidson BR, DeMuylder P,\nLuong TV, Fuller B (2018) Evolution of dynamic,\nbiochemical, and morphological parameters in\nhypothermic machine perfusion of human livers: A\nproof-of-concept study.

However, the preferred method\nremains controversial.\nAim: To conduct a meta-analysis on the impact of MP preservation on liver\ntransplant outcome.\nMethods: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically\nsearched to identify relevant trials comparing the efficacy of MP vs. CS. Odds ratios (OR)\nand fixed-effects models were calculated to compare the pooled data.\nResults: Ten prospective cohort studies and two randomized controlled trials\n(RCTs) were included (MP livers vs. CS livers = 315:489). Machine perfusion\ndemonstrated superior outcomes in posttransplantation aspartate aminotransferase\nlevels compared to CS (P < 0.05). The overall incidence of early allograft dysfunction\n(EAD) was significantly reduced with MP preservation than CS [OR = 0.46; 95%\nconfidence interval (CI) = 0.31–0.67; P < 0.0001]. The incidence of total biliary\ncomplications (OR = 0.53; 95% CI = 0.34–0.83; P = 0.006) and that of ischemic\ncholangiopathy (OR = 0.39; 95% CI = 0.18–0.85; P = 0.02) were significantly\nlower in recipients with MP preservation compared with CS preservation. Hypothermic\nmachine perfusion (HMP) but not normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) was\nfound to significantly protect grafts from total biliary complications and ischemic\ncholangiopathy (P < 0.05). However, no significant differences could be detected\nutilizing either HMP or NMP in primary nonfunction, hepatic artery thrombosis,\npostreperfusion syndrome, 1-year patient survival, or 1-year graft survival (P > 0.05).\n\nJia et al. Machine Perfusion: Future Preservation Method\nConclusions: Machine perfusion is superior to CS on improving short-term outcomes\nfor human liver transplantation, with a less clear effect in the longer term. Hypothermic\nmachine perfusion but not NMP conducted significantly protective effects on EAD\nand biliary complications. Further RCTs are warranted to confirm MP’s superiority\nand applications.\nKeywords: machine perfusion, static cold storage, graft preservation, liver transplantation, meta-analysis\nINTRODUCTION\nLiver transplantation (LT) has been the optimal treatment\nfor patients with end-stage liver disease. Rapidly increasing\ndemands for LT have also caused severe shortage of donor liver\norgans in clinical application. To overcome this discrepancy,\ndonation after circulatory death (DCD), extended criteria donors\n(ECDs), living liver donation, or marginal liver grafts are\nincreasingly accepted to expand the limited donor pool. However,\nstudies have suggested that these additional liver donation\nsources often suffered from longer warm ischemic periods and\nworse ischemia–reperfusion injury (IRI) during LT, resulting\nin increased risk of early allograft dysfunction (EAD), primary\nnonfunction (PNF), biliary complications, and poorer long-term\ngraft and patient survival (1).\nDuring transplantation, the quality of donor liver preservation\nis an important factor on maintaining and improving transplant\noutcomes of patients. Standard static cold storage (CS)\nremains the gold standard method for liver graft preservation.\nNevertheless, the effectiveness of CS preservation is currently\nunable to provide sufficient protection of liver grafts against IRI,\nespecially for prolonged CS of DCD and marginal livers, often\nresulting in increased risk of EAD, PNF, and biliary complications\n(2). As an alternative preservation strategy, machine perfusion\n(MP) can provide a continuous circulation of metabolic\nsubstrates and antioxidants, imitating the physiological processes\nwhile flushing inflammatory cytokine and toxins from the graft.\nTherefore, MP has been proposed as a better strategy to protect or\nrescue marginal liver grafts by attenuating the cytokine mediated\nIRI (3).\nMachine perfusion has been widely used for preservation\nin kidney transplantation. Plenty of evidence suggested MP’s\npriority in improving early graft function, reducing the risk of\ndelayed graft function (DGF), and enhancing ECD graft survival\nafter renal transplantation (4). Unlike kidney transplantation,\nMP remained relatively limited in clinical LTs due to the high\nmetabolism rates of liver, relatively complicated perfusion system\nAbbreviations: AST, aspartate aminotransferase; ALT, alanine transaminase; CI,\nconfidence interval; CS, cold storage; DBD, deceased brain donor; DCD, donor\nafter cardiac death; EAD, early allograft dysfunction; ECD, extended criteria\ndonors; HAT, hepatic artery thrombosis; HMP, hypothermic machine perfusion;\nHOPE, hypothermic oxygenated perfusion; IRI, ischemia–reperfusion injury; IC,\nischemic cholangiopathy; LT, liver transplantation; MP, machine perfusion; MELD,\nmodel for end-stage liver disease; NOS, Newcastle–Ottawa Quality Assessment\nScale; NMP, normothermic machine perfusion; OR:odds ratio; PNF, primary\nnonfunction; PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta￾Analysis.\nconsisting of hepatic and portal route, poor practicality, and\nhigh costs.\nLarge animal and human experimental studies have suggested\nthat MP may provide better protection of liver grafts against\nIRI than CS (5, 6). Expression of proinflammatory cytokines,\noxidation markers, and activation of adhesion molecules and\nmigration of leukocytes were significantly reduced by MP (7).\nRecently, two systematic review and meta-analyses concluded\nthat MP preservation is superior to CS in experimental rat and\npig models in terms of reducing hepatocellular injury [lower\naspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT),\nlactate dehydrogenase levels] and biliary injury (lower alkaline\nphosphatase, hyaluronic acid levels) (8, 9). Clinical adoption of\nMP in LT has been intensively tested. Since the first clinical\nseries investigating the safety and efficacy of MP compared with\nCS was reported by Guarrera et al. (10), increasing comparative\nstudies on MP and CS has been reported, showing the potential\nbenefit in improving early graft function, reducing posttransplant\ncomplications, and enhancing long-term survival (11). However,\nthose benefits on outcomes were inconclusive without the pooled\nanalyses. Few systematic review and meta-analyses have tried\nto investigate the effectiveness of MP on human, but they were\neither short comprehensive or out-of-the-latest studies (12, 13).\nUpdated systematic review and meta-analyses are lacking and\nneeded to decide the preferred method of graft storage.\nIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, we systematically\nanalyzed the available published data to compare MP\npreservation with CS preservation on outcomes of LT, including\nEAD, PNF, biliary complications, and graft and patient survival\nafter transplantation, with the aim of identifying the optimum\npreservation method for donor livers and achieving preferable\noutcomes in clinical application.\nMETHODS\nLiterature Search\nA comprehensive literature search was carried out on\nPubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases\nusing the following terms: ((machine perfusion OR machine\npreservation) AND (liver OR liver transplant OR liver\ntransplantation)). The literature search was performed in\nNovember 2019. Publications were limited to articles written\nin English. The titles and abstracts of all relevant publications\nwere reviewed, and full texts of those potentially matching\nthe inclusion criteria were retrieved. Reference lists of the\nretrieved full-text articles were also searched manually to help\nidentify potentially eligible studies. This systematic review and\nFrontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 2 May 2020 | Volume 7 | Article 135\n\nJia et al. Machine Perfusion: Future Preservation Method\nmeta-analysis was performed in line with the PRISMA (Preferred\nReporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)\nrecommendations (14).\nStudy Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria\nClinical studies comparing outcomes of human LT using MP\npreservation vs. static CS were eligible for this analysis.\nExclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies without a\ncontrol group (without CS preservation group); (2) studies\nnot controlling the donor type between the MP group and\nCS group; (3) studies using unusual MP method (including\nsubnormothermic MP and controlled rewarming MP); (4)\noverlapping studies from the same institution; (5) studies\nreporting none of the following outcomes of interest: EAD, PNF,\nbiliary complications, vascular complications, graft survival, and\npatient survival; (6) simultaneous liver–kidney transplantation,\nmultiple organ transplantation, and living donor transplantation\nstudies; (7) nonhuman studies and experimental studies; (8)\nabstracts, letters, editorials, books, expert opinions, case reports,\nand review articles.\nQuality Evaluation and Data Extraction\nNewcastle–Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) was used to\nevaluate the methodological quality of the included prospective\ncohort studies (15). The quality of randomized controlled trial\n(RCT) study was assessed using the Jadad score and the Cochrane\nCollaboration’s risk of bias tool (16). Studies with score >6\nwere regarded as high quality. Two investigators (J.J. and Y.N.)\nreviewed the publications, assessed the quality, and extracted the\ndata independently. Disagreements were resolved by discussion\nand consensus, confirmed by another investigator (S.-S.Z.).\nThe primary outcomes extracted included the incidence\nof EAD, PNF, hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT), total biliary\ncomplications, and ischemic cholangiopathy (IC) rates after\ntransplantation. Secondary outcomes included liver graft\nfunction, postreperfusion syndrome (PRS), and 1-month,\n6-month, and 1-year graft and patient survival rates.\nAll of the studies defined EAD according to Olthoff et al.\n(17). To be specific, EAD was defined as the presence of at\nleast one of the following at 7 days after LT: serum bilirubin 10\nmg/dL; or international normalized ratio 1.6; or ALT >2,000 U/L\nin the first 7 postoperative days. Primary nonfunction was\nindicated as irreversible graft dysfunction, for nontechnical and\nnonimmunological causes, leading to death or emergency liver\nreplacement during the first 10 days after LT (18). Definition of\nIC was according to Lee et al. (19). Total biliary complications at\n1 year were defined as all the complications related with biliary\nduct including biliary leaks, biliary stricture, and other biliary\ncomplications. Postreperfusion syndrome was defined according\nto Hilmi et al. (20).\nStatistical Analysis\nPooled odds ratios (ORs) were used to evaluate the summary\nevent rates (dichotomous data) with 95% confidence interval\n(CI). Standardized mean difference (SMD) was used to compare\ncontinuous data. Cochran Q (χ\n2\n) and the I\n2\nstatistical\ntest were adopted to evaluate the heterogeneity among the\nincluded studies. Heterogeneity was considered significant when\nP < 0.10 or I\n2 > 50%. In the absence of heterogeneity\namong the included studies, a fixed-effects model was adopted\nto combine studies and pool the total effect size; otherwise,\na random-effects model was adopted. Funnel plots were\ncreated for assessment of publication bias (publication bias was\nexamined in funnel plots by performing Begg and Egger tests).\nP < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical\nanalyses were performed using Cochrane Review Manager\n5.3. (http://ims.cochrane.org/revman).\nRESULTS\nSearch Results and Study Characteristics\nAs for the selection process according to the PRISMA guidelines,\nthe detailed process of our literature search is shown in Figure 1.\nBriefly, Initial literature searches identified 1,289 publications.\nAfter excluding ineligible publications based on the selection\nand exclusion criteria, 12 studies, including 10 nonrandomized\nprospective phase I clinical trials (10, 21–29), one multi￾institutional randomized study (18), and one single-center,\nrandomized controlled study (30), were eventually included in\nthe meta-analysis of the comparison between MP and CS on\nclinical outcomes in LT. In the 12 included studies, five studies\nused hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP), whereas the other\nseven studies investigated normothermic machine perfusion\n(NMP). Of these 12 studies, seven were from European institutes,\nincluding four single-center prospective trials, one multicenter\nprospective trials (22, 25–27), one prospective multicenter\nRCT (18), and one single-center, randomized controlled study\n(30); two single-center prospective trials were from Canadian\ninstitutes (23, 24), whereas the remaining three studies were from\nthe US institutes (10, 21). The years of publication spanned from\n2010 to 2019. After combining all the studies, 315 patients were\nincluded into the MP group, and 489 patients were included into\nthe CS group as control in our meta-analysis.\nThe characteristics of each study are summarized in Table 1.\nThe outcomes of each study are presented in Table 2 and\nSupplementary Data. As shown in Table S1, the quality of the 12\nincluded studies was good. The quality scores of included cohort\nstudies, evaluated by the NOS, ranged from 7 to 9 points (with a\nmean of 7.9), whereas the risk of bias in the two included RCTs\nwas low.\nMeta-Analysis of Primary Outcomes\nLiver Graft Injury\nReperfusion injury and liver graft function were determined by\nAST and/or ALT serum levels after transplantation. As shown in\nTable 2, all 12 included studies reported posttransplant peak ALT\nand/or AST level within 1 week. Seven of the 12 included studies\nfound a significantly lower posttransplant peak ALT and/or AST\nlevel during the first 7 days after surgery in the MP group\ncompared with the CS group (P < 0.05) (10, 18, 21, 22, 25, 26,\n28), whereas the rest (five studies) observed comparable hepatic\ntransaminases levels between two groups (23, 24, 27, 29, 30).\nHowever, different studies reported transaminase by different\ndata types and at variable time points. Only three studies reported\nFrontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 3 May 2020 | Volume 7 | Article 135\n\nJia et al. Machine Perfusion: Future Preservation Method\nFIGURE 1 | Flowchart showing search strategy with inclusions and exclusions.\nposttransplant peak ALT and AST level by mean and standard\ndeviation (10, 28, 29). Meta-analysis demonstrated that livers\npreserved with MP had significantly lower peak AST levels than\nCS (SMD = −0.53; 95% CI = −1.04 to −0.02; P = 0.04)\n(Figure 2). There was also a trend favoring the use of MP\nin reducing posttransplant peak ALT levels compared with CS\n(SMD = −0.44; 95% CI = −0.91 to −0.02; P = 0.06) (Figure 2).\nMoreover, eight of the 12 included studies clinically measured\nthe longitudinal serum hepatic transaminases levels in 1 or\n2 weeks after transplantation. Except Bral and colleagues’s trial\n(24), seven studies reported a faster decline in posttransplant\nhepatic transaminases levels in MP preservation recipients when\ncompared to CS preservation recipients (10, 18, 21–23, 26, 30).\nNotably, six studies, including the large sample multicenter RCT\nby Nasralla et al. (18) and the RCT by Ghinolfi et al. (30), found\nstatistically different reducing trends on posttransplant hepatic\ntransaminases between the two groups within the first week after\ntransplantation (P < 0.05) (10, 18, 21, 22, 26, 30).\nEarly Allograft Dysfunction\nEleven of the 12 included studies reported the incidence of EAD\nwithin the first week posttransplantation. The overall rate of\nEAD was 15.2% (range, 0–55.6%) for the MP group and 30.6%\n(0–46.4%) for the CS group. Pooled meta-analysis of the HMP\nand NMP studies revealed that the overall rate of EAD was\nsignificantly reduced in the MP preservation compared with the\nCS preservation (fixed effects: OR = 0.46; 95% CI = 0.31–0.67;\nP < 0.0001) (Figure 3). There was no statistically significant\nheterogeneity among the 11 included studies (χ\n2 = 12.94,\nP = 0.17, I\n2 = 30%).\nSubgroup analysis showed no significant difference between\ntwo subgroups (I\n2 = 0%; P = 0.78). In the subgroup analysis,\nEAD rates were significantly lower in the HMP subgroup (fixed\neffects: OR = 0.49; 95% CI = 0.27–0.88; P = 0.02) compared\nto those of CS. There is statistically significant heterogeneity in\nthe NMP subgroup (χ\n2 = 9.76, P = 0.04, I\n2 = 59%). Thus, a\nrandom-effects model was adopted. However, subgroup analysis\nshowed no significant difference between NMP preservation and\nCS preservation (random effects: OR = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.24–1.52;\nP = 0.28, figure not shown). In the NMP subgroup, a sensitivity\nanalysis was conducted by excluding Bral and colleagues’ study\n(24) because of its heterogeneity in sample size and donor\ntype; the risk of EAD reached statistical significance between\ntwo groups (fixed effects: OR = 0.34; 95% CI = 0.20–0.59;\nP = 0.0001). The overall risk of EAD in the MP group remained\nstatistically significant (fixed effects: OR = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.27–\n0.60; P < 0.00001; χ\n2 = 7.07, P = 0.53, I\n2 = 0%) (figure\nnot shown).\nFrontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 4 May 2020 | Volume 7 | Article 135\n\nJia et al.

The overall incidence of\nHAT was 2.1% (range, 0–10.0%) in the MP group and 5.2%\n(range, 0–10.0%) in the CS group, respectively.

However,\nthere was no statistical significance (P > 0.05). A pooled meta￾analysis of HMP and NMP studies indicated that there was no\nstatistical significance in HAT rates between MP preservation\nand CS preservation (OR = 0.55; 95% CI = 0.21–1.44;\nP = 0.22) (Figure S1).\nPostreperfusion Syndrome\nFour studies reported the rates of PRS.

However, it had no statistical significance (Figure S2).\nPatient Survival and Liver Graft Survival\nTo evaluate the posttransplant survival outcomes of MP\npreservation vs. CS preservation, the data of graft survival\nand patient survival at 1 month, 6 month, and 1 year were\nextracted and analyzed (Table S2).

Our\nanalysis concludes that compared with CS preservation MP can\nreduce the risk of post-LT EAD and total biliary complications.\nHowever, MP preservation could not improve PNF, 1-year graft,\nand patient survival.\nTheoretically, MP preservation can simulate physiological\ncondition ex vivo after donor liver procurement by effectively\nproviding continuous circulation of oxygen, essential nutrients,\nand adequate adenosine triphosphate substrates to restore the\nnormal physiological and also supplying vasodilators to maintain\nthe peribiliary vascular microcirculation while flushing out the\nmetabolites to avoid accumulation of toxic substances. Evidence\nfrom animal models and human studies suggests that MP can\navoid cold ischemia injury during preservation and reduce\nposttransplant IRI and sterile inflammation, thus causing less\ndamage to hepatocytes and the biliary epithelia in both deceased\nbrain donor (DBD) and DCD LT compared with CS preservation.\nAs a result, MP has been found to bring about significantly\nreduced posttransplant peak enzyme release, lower EAD rates,\nless biliary complications, and shorter hospital stay in MP livers.\nLiver graft reperfusion injury was usually determined by\nAST and/or ALT serum levels after transplantation. Previous\nevidence suggested that episodes of EAD and elevation of\nhepatic transaminases may adversely affect survival rates after\nLT (17). Although the present analysis for posttransplant\nAST/ALT comparisons was limited by different data types and\nvariable time points during recording clinical data in different\nstudies, our systematic review did show that all 12 included\nstudies observed posttransplant AST/ALT reductions in the\nMP preservation group, with seven studies reaching statistical\nsignificance (Table 2). Further pooled meta-analysis did confirm\nthe use of MP in reducing posttransplant peak AST levels\n(P < 0.05), and there was a trend favoring MP in ALT\nlevels (P = 0.06) (Figure 2). Notably, 10 studies among all\nincluded studies showed lower EAD rates in the MP group, with\npooled meta-analysis reaching statistical significance (Figure 3,\nP < 0.0001). In line with animal studies, our meta-analysis\nsuggested that MP can achieve definite protecting effects for\nreducing IRI by decreasing transaminases releasing.\nAs expected, a definite reduction in the overall risk of EAD was\nconfirmed in MP preservation recipients when compared with\nCS preservation (OR = 0.46; P < 0.0001) (Figure 3), indicating\nMP’s excellent protective effects in hepatocellular function. It\nis notable that these reductions in peak hepatic transaminases\nand EAD rates were achieved in the context of using DCDs or\nECDs with longer functional warm ischemia times (WITs) and\nlonger preservation times in the MP group (Table 1), suggesting\nthat MP may have substantial benefits in the desired objective of\nexpanding donor pool and increasing organ utilization without\ncompromising outcome.\nBiliary complications have shown to be the most frequent\ncomplications after DCD LT. Nonanastomotic biliary strictures\nor IC is one of the most feared complications of DCD\nLT. Specially, DCD recipients have a threefold higher\nrisk of developing nonanastomotic biliary strictures after\ntransplantation compared with DBD recipients (31). Long\nperiods of donor warm ischemia in DCD donation are\nbelieved to be responsible for IC and graft loss. One important\nbenefit of MP may be its ability to maintain the peribiliary\nvascular microcirculation and restore the normal physiological\nenvironment of biliary tree, which has been shown to reduce\nbiliary IRI and biliary complications. The principal finding in\nthis study is that MP preservation can significantly reduce total\nbiliary complications at 1 year after transplantation (OR =\n0.53; P = 0.006) (Figure 5). Furthermore, the rates of IC were\nsignificantly lower in the MP group compared with the CS group\n(OR = 0.39; P = 0.02) (Figure 6). Van Rijn et al. (6) further\ninvestigated the protective effect of MP on histopathological\nlevel in their trial, showing that MP significantly reduced the\ninjury of the deep peribiliary glands and the degree of stroma\nnecrosis. Machine perfusion can resuscitate the DCDs from long\nfunctional warm ischemia and further protect the vulnerability\nof the biliary tree from IRI, which may substantially reduce\nbiliary complications, expand the donor poor, and increase\nDCD utilization.\nIn the current analysis, no significant effects could be detected\nfavoring the use of MP in reducing PNF rates compared with CS\n(OR = 0.60; P = 0.49). This may be true, or more likely, there may\nbe insufficient data to draw the conclusions about the benefits of\nMP on reducing PNF rates as clinical investigations on MP in LT\nare still limited. Primary nonfunction rates are relatively low in\nclinical practice, occurring in 5% to 8% of liver transplants, but\nit may be a life-threatening circumstance requiring immediate\nretransplantation (32, 33). In this study, the episodes of PNF\noccurred in only one HMP-ECD liver in Guarrera and colleagues’\nstudy, one NMP liver in Nasralla and colleagues’ study, and five\nCS preservation livers in two studies, whereas the other studies\nreported no incidence of PNF in either MP or CS preservation\ngroups (Table 2). The highest incidence of PNF remained only\n6.7% in CS-ECD in Guarrera and colleagues’ study (21). Thus,\nno difference seen in terms of reducing PNF rates may be due\nto an inability to detect an effect of MP because of the very\nlow incidence of PNF after transplantation. Further large sample\nclinical studies are needed to clarify this point.\nOur present meta-analysis identifies no significant difference\nin either 1-month, 6-month, or 1-year graft and patient\nsurvival between MP preservation recipients and CS preservation\nrecipients (Figures S3, S4). Actually, 11 of the 12 included\nstudies reported no significant improvement in graft and patient\nsurvival after MP preservation. Only in Dutkowski et al. (22)\nretrospective comparative analysis, 1-year graft survival was\nsignificantly improved in the MP-DCD group compared to\nthe CS-DCD group (P = 0.035). Although there was a trend\nfavoring MP preservation in Patrono and colleagues’ study\n(29), with graft survival rates within the first year almost\nFrontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 10 May 2020 | Volume 7 | Article 135\n\nJia et al. Machine Perfusion: Future Preservation Method\nreaching significant level (P = 0.18), a longer follow-up result\nwas lacking. In Dutkowski and colleagues’ recent serial study\n(34), they first reported 5-year graft survival after censoring\ntumor recurrence was significantly improved by HOPE, reaching\n94% in the HOPE-treated DCD group, compared to 78% in\nthe untreated DCD group (n = 50, P = 0.024) (Figure 3),\nsuggesting the superiority of MP preservation in DCD livers.\nHowever, this small-number cohort study has limitations such\nas retrospective design, different implantation techniques, and\ninconsistent immune suppression between the MP and CS\ngroups, highlighting the necessity for large-sample RCTs. In\npig models, the recent meta-analysis identified no significant\ndifference in 5- to 7-day survival rate between the MP group and\nCS group (9). Therefore, no clear evidence yet can be drawn to\nconclude MP’s superiority to CS preservation in posttransplant\nsurvival within 1-year follow-up. Definite superiority of MP\npreservation in graft and patient survival compared with CS\npreservation still needs to be investigated in future RCTs with\nlonger follow-up.\nBy reducing IRI and offering the opportunity for ex vivo\ngraft repair through delivery of targeted additives, MP seems to\nprovide more obviously protective effects in relatively low-quality\ndonors such as ECDs or DCDs. Thus, MP has the potential to\nresuscitate the donor graft from IRI to a better state, reduce the\ndiscarded rates, and increase the overall organ utilization. The\nresults of this study on MP’s benefits are consistent with those\nfindings in kidney transplantation. In kidney transplantation,\nlarge RCTs and recent meta-analyses have drawn the conclusions\nof MP’s superiority to CS on improvement in short-term\noutcomes, such as enhanced early renal function and decreased\nrisk of DGF in DCD and ECD grafts. Similar to our analysis,\nhowever, no significant differences could be found in PNF rates\nand patient survival between MP and CS for DCD LT (35). In\none recent meta-analysis of NMP-assisted pig LT (12), both ex\nvivo and in situ NMP could significantly reduced peak AST and\nALT levels compared with CS for DCD livers (P < 0.00001). It\nis worth noting that total bile production was also significantly\nhigher (mean = 174 mL; CI, 155–193; P < 0.0001) in the NMP\ngroup, indicating the excellent effect of NMP in preserving liver\nfunctions and viability assessment. In Zhang and colleagues’\nrecent meta-analysis on HMP, they found that HMP could\nsignificantly reduce the incidences of EAD (OR = 0.36; 95%\nCI = 0.17–0.77; P = 0.008) and biliary complications (OR = 0.47;\n95% CI = 0.28–0.76; P = 0.003), respectively. And there was no\ndifference in the incidence of PNF (OR = 0.30; 95% CI = 0.06–\n1.47; P = 0.14) and vascular complications (OR = 0.69; 95%\nCI = 0.29–1.6; P = 0.41) between HMP and CS preservation.\nThese results were consistent with our present analysis. However,\nZhang et al. found that 1-year graft survival was significantly\nincreased in HMP preservation compared to CS preservation\n(OR = 2.19; 95% CI = 1.14–4.20; P = 0.02), in which there\nwas no difference in our analysis (OR = 1.15; 95% CI = 0.59–\n2.22; P = 0.42). To be noted, Zhang and colleagues’ meta￾analysis included overlapping studies from the same institution\n[Guarrera et al. (21) and Schlegel et al. (34)], which may magnify\nthe protective effects of HMP on outcomes. Moreover, the\nincluded study of Dutkowski et al. (22) in Zhang and colleagues’\nmeta-analysis did not control the donor type, with DCD livers in\nthe HMP group and DBD livers in the CS group, which may bring\nsome bias in the meta-analysis. Therefore, the benefits of MP\non long-term survival required further researches. Combining\naforementioned findings in kidney transplantation, MP in pig\nLT, and the results of this study, it is reasonable to conclude that\nMP preservation could enhance early graft function recovery and\nimprove short-term outcomes after LT. However, there may be\nless-clear benefits in the longer-term graft and patient outcomes.\nIn Tchilikidi’s (36) systematic review, the short-term outcomes\nand 30-day mortality had no difference between NMP and CS\nby comprehensive analysis on large literatures. The protective\neffect of MP needs to be validated in more large multicenter\nprospective trials with larger samples and longer-term follow￾up. In recent years, a batch of human clinical trials involving\nthe use of HMP or NMP in LT was implemented to further\nvalidate MP’s safety, feasibility, and its superiority on long￾term outcomes (36). The results of some important RCTs are\ncoming out in the next few years, which may greatly propel the\ndevelopment of MP’s clinical applications (2, 36). Future meta￾analyses are necessary to confirm the recommendation of MP in\nhuman LT.\nThe present study has several limitations. First, clinical\nheterogeneity between the included studies might still exist,\nalthough we had adopted strict enrollment criteria during\nscreening the references. Selection bias due to different donor\ntypes, perfusion models, perfusion routes, hemodynamics, cold\nischemia times (CITs), and perioperative parameter among\ndifferent publications may still result in analytical bias. Notably,\na recent meta-analysis did not observe any differences in post-LT\noutcomes such as PNF, biliary complication, and 1-year survival\nwhile using different perfusion fluids, volumes, or perfusion\nroutes (37), indicating these factors may have less effect on\nthe LT outcomes. Second, the number and the sample size of\nincluded studies are relatively small as clinical application of\nMP in LT and the completed human cases are still limited.\nThere is unlikely to be adequate power to identify differences in\nrelatively low-risk complications such as PNF. Also, the follow￾up in the majority of included studies is relatively short, and very\nfew studies reported 1-year graft and patient survival. Thus, no\nsufficient evidence can be obtained to find differences in graft\nand patient survival. In addition, this study presented data only\nabout the short-term patient and graft survival, the influence\nof MP on long-term survival remains unclear. Third, the MP\ntechnique used in clinical setting is still under the stages of\npreliminary clinical trial. The meta-analysis data in this study\nmainly came from small-number trials, and the overall level of\nclinical evidence is not high. Considering these limitations in\nstudy methodology and sample size, further large-sample RCTs\nare needed to further confirm the benefits of MP on the prognosis\nof LT.\nIn conclusion, this meta-analysis demonstrates that MP\npreservation, especially HMP, could significantly improve short￾term outcomes by reducing the rates of EAD, total biliary\ncomplications, and IC after transplantation compared to CS\npreservation. However, it was not correlated with the incidence of\nPNF, HAT, and 1-year graft and patient survivals.

These organs are known to function poorly if\ntransplanted but make up a significant portion of the available pool of donated livers. This\nstudy demonstrates the ability to improve the function of steatotic rat livers using a combina￾tion of ex situ machine perfusion and a “defatting” drug cocktail. After 6 hours of perfusion,\ndefatted livers demonstrated lower perfusate lactate levels and improved bile quality as\ndemonstrated by higher bile bicarbonate and lower bile lactate. Furthermore, defatting was\nassociated with decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased\nexpression of enzymes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Rehabilitation of mar￾ginal or discarded steatotic livers using machine perfusion and tailored drug therapy can sig￾nificantly increase the supply of donor livers for transplantation.\nIntroduction\nLiver transplantation remains the only cure for end-stage liver disease. However, there contin￾ues to be a significant organ shortage with approximately 14, 000 patients on the waitlist and\n8,000 liver transplants performed annually [1]. Central to the donor organ shortage is the high\ndiscard rate of procured or potentially procurable organs, with nearly 3,000 livers discarded\nper year [2]. As a result of the obesity epidemic in the United States and Europe, nearly half of\nprocured livers are discarded due to excessive macrosteatosis related to non-alcoholic fatty\nliver disease (NAFLD) [3].\nPLOS ONE\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0232886 May 12, 2020 1 / 19\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Raigani S, Carroll C, Griffith S, Pendexter\nC, Rosales I, Deirawan H, et al.

The funders\nhad no role in study design, data collection,\nanalysis, or manuscript preparation.\n\nSteatotic livers are particularly prone to ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI)[4]. As a result,\ntransplantation of livers with moderate (30–60%) or severe (>60%) macrosteatosis is associ￾ated with increased early allograft dysfunction (EAD) or primary non-function, and decreased\nlong-term graft survival [5, 6]. Further contributing to IRI is acute-on-chronic oxidative stress,\ncompromised hepatic microcirculation, and an inability to recover from an energy-depleted\nstate [7–10].\nThe application of ex situ machine perfusion technology to liver resuscitation and rehabili￾tation has not only decreased the organ discard rate, but expanded the ability to use marginal,\nextended criteria, or even discarded livers for transplantation without compromising patient\nand graft survival [11, 12]. Using machine perfusion as a platform for targeted intervention\npaves the way for salvage of otherwise discarded organs for potential transplantation. One\napplication of this technology involves salvaging steatotic livers. Over 10 year ago, our group\nreported for the first time in the literature a combination of agents capable of “defatting” and\nreversing key biochemical deficiencies in steatotic hepatocytes in culture [13–15]. Boteon and\ncolleagues recently showed that the same cocktail decreases fat content and improves perfu￾sion parameters in discarded steatotic human livers [16]. However, the safety and utility of sev￾eral components of the cocktail have not been confirmed or have been abandoned for human\nclinical use [17]. We therefore performed a mechanistic study in a rat liver perfusion model to\nidentify pathways targeted by these agents, with the ultimate goal of replacing them with agents\ndeveloped in the interim 10 years that are safe for human clinical use.\nMethods\nPreparation of perfusate\nBaseline (plain) perfusate consisted of high-glucose Dulbecco’s Minimum Eagles’ Medium\nsupplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum, 2% v/v penicillin-streptomycin, and 3% w/v\nbovine serum albumin. The original development of the defatting cocktail in vitro [13, 14] and\nits subsequent cytotoxicity testing in cell culture models [15] have been previously described.\nDefatting cocktail agents include 10 uM forskolin, 1uM GW7647, 1uM GW501516, 10 uM\nscoparone, 10 uM hypericin, 0.4 ng/ml visfatin, 0.8 mM L-carnitine, and additional amino\nacids [13, 14]. Defatting perfusate consisted of plain perfusate supplemented with defatting\ncocktail. Perfusate and cocktail component details are provided in the Supplemental Methods\nin S1 File.\nIsolated liver perfusion\nLean (Fa/fa) and obese (fa/fa) male Zucker rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA)\naged 12–16 weeks and group housed in pairs in a conventional room under standard condi￾tions (21ºC room temperature, 12-hour light/dark cycles, mixed paper/cellulose bedding).\nRats had free access to standard chow and autoclaved water. Animal studies were approved by\nthe institutional animal use and care committee of the Massachusetts General Hospital and\nShriners Hospital for Children and comply with the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Ani￾mals as outlined by the National Academy of Sciences. After induction of anesthesia with\n3–5% isoflurane, a transverse laparotomy was made. The common bile duct was partially tran￾sected, cannulated with 28-gauge PTFE tubing, and secured with 4–0 silk sutures. 0.3 mL of\n1000U/mL heparin was injected into the inferior vena cava (IVC) and after 3 minutes of circu￾lation, the hepatic artery was ligated with 7–0 silk. Next, the portal vein was cannulated with a\n16-gauge catheter, followed immediately by transection of the IVC. The liver was then flushed\nslowly with 50 mL of ice-cold 0.9% saline via the portal cannula while the rat was simulta￾neously euthanized by exsanguination under isoflurane gas anesthesia. Following cold flush,\nPLOS ONE\nImproving function of steatotic livers for transplant with defatting and machine perfusion\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0232886 May 12, 2020 2 / 19\nCompeting interests: Dr. Uygun is inventor on\npending patents relevant to this study (WO/2011/\n002926; WO/2011/35223) and has a provisional\npatent application relevant to this study (MGH\n22743).

Total cold ischemic time was less than 10 minutes.\nThree groups of six rats were used. 6 livers from lean rats (LL) underwent plain perfusion,\nacting as positive control. 6 livers from obese rats (SL) underwent plain perfusion as negative\ncontrols, and 6 livers from obese rats underwent defatting perfusion (DSL).\nThe perfusion reservoir contained 500 mL of perfusate. A roller pump system (Masterflex\nL/S, Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL) was used to propel perfusate through a combination heat\nexchanger-oxygenator, exposed to a gas mixture of 1-2L/min of 5% CO2/95% O2 at 37º Cel￾sius, and a bubble trap, before perfusing the liver via the portal vein cannula. A filter was not\nused in the circuit. Pump flow rate was titrated to a portal perfusion pressure of 10–12 mm Hg\nmeasured via water column. Outflow from the liver IVC was collected in the liver basin and\nreturned to the perfusion reservoir for recirculation. Livers were perfused for 6 hours. Perfus￾ate samples were taken from the liver basin immediately after initiation of perfusion, at 30\nminutes, and at each hour. Bile was collected and sampled at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours. Livers were\nweighed immediately before and after perfusion. The study flowchart is represented in S1 Fig.\nHistologic evaluation\nAfter 6 hours of perfusion, duplicate biopsies were taken from the left lateral lobe and the right\nmedial lobe. One set was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent analysis and one set was\nformalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. The liver tissue was sectioned in 5-micron slices,\nmounted on glass slides, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Oil red staining was also per￾formed on sectioned frozen liver tissue. Histopathologic assessment was carried by two blinded\npathologists. An image guide previously reported by Hall et al. was used to increase accuracy\nand interobserver concordance [18]. Estimated fat proportionate area (FPA) was used to evalu￾ate macrosteatotic changes in the liver by examination at 4x and subsequently confirmed at 20x\nmagnification. Microsteatosis was quantified under 20x magnification. Discordant cases were\nreviewed collectively, and consensus obtained for the final interpretation reported.\nPerfusate and bile analysis\nPerfusate and bile samples were collected as above and stored at -80˚C for future analysis.\nAssays for ketone bodies (MAK134, Millipore-Sigma, Burlington, MA), triglyceride\n(MAK266, Millipore-Sigma), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL; MAK045, Millipore￾Sigma), aspartate aminotransferase (AST; TR70121, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA), alanine\naminotransferase (ALT; TR71121, Thermo Fisher), were performed on perfusate samples per\nthe manufacturer’s instructions. Biochemistry and blood gas measurements were performed\non bile and perfusate samples using a point-of-care handheld device (iSTAT CG4+ and\nChem8+ cartridges, Abbott Laboratories, NJ). Oxygen uptake rate (OUR) was calculated as:\nOUR ¼ V½CO2;inflow  CO2;outflow�\nliver weight\nwhere V is the perfusion flow rate (mL/min) and CO2 is the oxygen concentration. CO2 was cal￾culated as 0.0031�\nPO2, where PO2 is the partial pressure of oxygen (mmHg) and 0.0031 (mL\nO2/(mmHg�\ndL)) is the solubility of oxygen in aqueous solutions at 37˚C [13].\nDetermination of mRNA levels with quantitative RT-PCR\nFrozen liver tissue from the left lateral lobe of liver was crushed under liquid nitrogen. Total\nRNA extraction was performed using the RNeasy Mini Kit per the manufacturer’s instructions\nPLOS ONE\nImproving function of steatotic livers for transplant with defatting and machine perfusion\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0232886 May 12, 2020 3 / 19\n\n(Qiagen, Waltham, MA). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was reverse transcribed and quanti￾tative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using rat Fatty Liver RT2 Profile PCR Array\n(Qiagen) on an Applied Biosystems ViiA 7 reader. Target gene expression was normalized to\nthat of the SL group. Relative quantification of gene expression was performed using the ΔΔCt\nmethod [19] and transformed to represent fold change.\nTargeted metabolite analysis\nFrozen tissue biopsies at end-perfusion were pulverized (~25mg) and analyzed for energy\ncofactors using a targeted multiple reaction monitoring analysis on a 3200 triple quadrupole\nliquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (QTRAP LC/MS-MS) system (AB Sciex, Foster\nCity, CA), as previously described [20]. Adenosine tri-, di-, and mono- phosphate (ATP, ADP,\nAMP), nicotinamide adenine nucleotide (NADH/NAD+\n), and nicotinamide adenine nucleo￾tide phosphate (NADPH/NADP+\n) tissue levels were quantified and pertinent redox ratios\nwere calculated. Energy charge was defined as [ATP + ADP�0.5]/[ATP+ADP+AMP].\nStatistical analysis\nIndependent continuous data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).\nWhen the ANOVA reached significance, individual t tests were performed between groups\n[21]. Repeated measures data were analyzed using a random intercept mixed model with a cat￾egorical effect of time, a categorical effect of group, and the group by time interactions. Data\nare presented as means ± standard error of the mean (SEM), unless otherwise indicated. A P\nvalue of 0.05 was considered significant. All statistical tests were performed using Stata v15\n(StataCorp, College Station, TX), and graphics were created using Prism 8 (GraphPad, San\nDiego, CA).\nNetwork analysis\nNetwork analysis was performed and visualized in Cytoscape [22] with the ReactomeFIViz\napplication which interfaces with the Reactome Functional Interaction database [23]. The net￾work was created using expression data from all genes examined with quantitative RT-PCR\n(gene set). Linker genes that shared two or more functional interactions with individual targets\nfrom the gene set were included to ensure that none of the genes investigated were excluded\nfrom the functional network due to a lack of direct interaction.\nResults\nSteatotic livers demonstrate improved function during defatting perfusion\nDSL and SL groups had a similar rise in perfusate lactate content during the first two hours of\nperfusion, while the LL group had a significantly slower rise as compared to the SL group.\nAfter 2 hours of perfusion, DSL livers began clearing lactate, which became significantly lower\nat hours 4 through 6, compared to the SL group (Fig 1A). Similarly, the anion gap of the per￾fusate increased initially in all three groups but decreased significantly in the LL and DSL\ngroups starting at the 2nd hour of perfusion compared to the SL group (Fig 1B).\nDefatting perfusion improves the quality of synthesized bile\nBicarbonate levels in bile produced by DSL livers were significantly higher compared to the SL\ngroup at each measurement point (Fig 2A).

A recent proof of concept study by Boteon et al. using the\ndefatting cocktail reported here, demonstrated its effectiveness in improving functional\nparameters and decreasing macrosteatosis in discarded human steatotic livers [16]. Because of\nconcerns with safety in humans of several components, we performed a mechanistic study in a\nrat liver perfusion model in order to identify agents safe for human clinical trials with the\npotential to perform the same functions. We corroborated the prior report of improved func￾tional parameters and bile quality with defatting cocktail but demonstrate notable off-target\nand adverse effects related to the cocktail components that can be optimized in future studies.\nFor example, visfatin was thought to be an insulin-mimetic signaling protein, yet the origi￾nal manuscript describing its action has been retracted [26]. Other studies characterize its\nfunction as a pro-inflammatory cytokine found in higher levels with worsening steatosis [27,\n28]. Hypericin, a component of St. John’s wort, activates PXR and upregulates enzymes\ninvolved in drug metabolism, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) [29]. PXR activation\nis associated worsening steatosis and insulin resistance, though it does have anti-inflammatory\nFig 8.

Similarly, forskolin and scoparone\nare herbal extracts with reported anti-inflammatory and steatosis-reducing effects in animal\nstudies but have not been rigorously tested in humans [30–32]. Carnitine, an over-the-counter\nsupplement, appears to be the only safe and effective component of the cocktail that can be\nused in future studies [14]. Our understanding of the pathophysiology of NAFLD and NASH\nhas greatly improved in the last decade, and clinicians are now on the verge of a new era were\npharmaceutical therapy is becoming available for the treatment of these diseases [33].\nThe defatting cocktail in this study does demonstrate effectiveness in targeting several path￾ways. Most remarkable is the downregulation of pro-inflammatory targets TNF-α and NF-κB\nin defatted compared to untreated livers. The overall anti-inflammatory effect of the defatting\ncocktail is consistent with reported mechanisms of several components, including activation\nof PPAR-α and -β/δ (GW7646, GW501516), PXR (hypericin), and constitutive androstane\nreceptor (CAR; scoparone) [30]. Another upregulated pathway involves mitochondrial FAO.\nWe found that ketone body production, a marker of FAO, was significantly higher in the DSL\ngroup compared to the SL group. This is further supported by increased expression of CPT2\nand ACOX1 genes, key enzymes involved in mitochondrial FAO. Given the safety concerns of\nthe cocktail components, it is worth examining recently-developed drugs under clinical trial\nthat target similar pathways. Elafibranor, a dual PPAR-α/δ agonist, has demonstrated efficacy\nin decreasing inflammation (via NF-κB targets) and increasing FAO by upregulating expres￾sion of CPT1α and ACOX1 [34, 35]. In an international, randomized, double-blind placebo￾controlled trial of patients with NASH, elafibranor significantly reduced liver injury enzymes,\nlipids, glucose profiles, and markers of systemic inflammation. Treatment also resulted in\ngreater resolution of NASH than placebo and was well-tolerated [36]. Other drugs with similar\ntarget profiles include pioglitazone, a PPAR-γ agonist that demonstrated improvement in stea￾tosis and lobular inflammation in a phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trial of adults\nwith NASH [37]. Another commonly used lipid-lowering agent, bezafibrate, has pan-PPAR\nagonist activity and reduced hepatic steatosis and gluconeogenesis [38, 39].\nOne novel finding in this study was that despite increased expression of APOB, DSL livers\nhad lower perfusate VLDL/LDL levels compared to SL livers at end-perfusion. The lower\nVLDL/LDL levels in the DSL group appears to indicate a process that favors decreased exocy￾tosis of low-density lipoproteins, allowing these molecules to be potentially used for energy\nmetabolism. In the same clinical trial above, elafibranor decreased serum triglyceride and LDL\ncholesterol levels, increased HDL cholesterol levels, while decreasing liver steatosis, demon￾strating potential efficacy for improving the lipid profile and metabolism of steatotic livers dur￾ing machine perfusion [36].\nThe farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor in the same class of the PPARs, has\nbecome well-defined in recent years as another metabolic target in the treatment of NASH.\nThe defatting cocktail used in this study did not demonstrate a significant change in gene\nexpression of FXR (S1 Table). In a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, obeticholic\nacid (OCA; a synthetic FXR agonist) improved steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis [40], indi￾cating potential efficacy if used in the ex situ perfusion setting.\nWith respect to steatotic liver content, the question as to whether complete defatting is nec￾essary during perfusion to produce a liver viable for transplantation remains unanswered. The\nlack of a significant difference in macrosteatosis content between SL and DSL groups, despite\nnotable functional improvement, indicates that complete “defatting” or achieving macrostea￾tosis content below 30% is not the primary outcome of lipid-modulating perfusion. Rather,\nrehabilitating steatotic livers to function with the characteristics of lean, viable livers should be\nthe goal. This is further corroborated by data from discarded human steatotic livers, which\nPLOS ONE\nImproving function of steatotic livers for transplant with defatting and machine perfusion\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0232886 May 12, 2020 14 / 19\n\ndemonstrated improved function and viability in livers that were not defatted to below 30%\nmacrosteatosis after 12 hours of perfusion [16].\nThere were several limitations to this study. A pre-perfusion liver biopsy was not obtained,\nmaking paired comparisons of macrosteatosis and triglyceride content pre- and post-perfusion\nnot possible. Furthermore, defatted livers experienced an unexpected increase in weight dur￾ing perfusion while plain-perfused steatotic livers had a weight decrease. This was likely due to\na portal perfusion pressure that was too high. It is not known why this affected the defatted liv￾ers and not the control steatotic livers, though endothelial injury related to the cocktail is a pos￾sibility. Another limitation of the rat liver perfusion model is that macrosteatosis decreases in\nsteatotic livers undergoing plain perfusion as well, a finding that is present in the porcine\nmodel, but not humans [41, 42]. This may have made any further defatting stimulated by the\ncocktail difficult to detect by global methods such as histology. It may be that the rat liver per￾fusion model is exceedingly efficient at inducing metabolism of intracellular lipid droplets or\nthey are being degraded via other mechanisms. Finally, we did not assess in vivo function of\nthe control and defatted livers after perfusion using a rat liver transplantation model. This was\ndone in an effort to reduce the number of animals needed while still obtaining novel data to\nallow further refinement of the drug cocktail prior to scaling up to animal transplantation\nstudies. Future investigations should evaluate the optimized, clinically applicable drug cock￾tail’s impact on IRI, including mechanisms of complement, ROS release, and liver immune\nactivation in a rat liver transplantation model with improved generalizability, such as diet￾induced steatosis, longer cold ischemia, and added warm ischemia.\nConclusion\nLipid modulation of steatotic rat livers using a drug cocktail that targets mitochondrial fatty\nacid oxidation is able to improve liver function and bile quality, in addition to decreasing\nmacrosteatosis content. Further research using safe, clinically applicable drugs interventions is\nrequired prior to initiating human clinical trials.\nSupporting information\nS1 Fig. Study flowchart. 6 livers from each group were procured, underwent brief cold ische￾mia (<10 minutes), and then were normothermically perfused for 6 hours. Perfusate and bile\nwere collected and analyzed at regular intervals. Circulating baseline perfusate was supple￾mented with the defatting cocktail in the DSL group. Liver tissue was collected for analysis\nafter six hours of perfusion (formalin-fixed and snap-frozen). LL, control lean livers; SL, con￾trol steatotic livers; DSL, defatted steatotic livers.\n(EPS)\nS2 Fig. Perfusate glucose content and portal venous flow rates during perfusion of rat liv￾ers. (a) Perfusate glucose content during perfusion shows significant variability between\ngroups. Lean livers demonstrate consistent glucose levels, whereas steatotic liver demonstrate\nrising glucose levels likely as a result of excessive gluconeogenesis. Defatting perfusion appears\nto worsen the hyperglycemia associated with steatotic livers (b) Portal venous flow rates for a\nfixed portal venous perfusion pressure of 10–12 mm Hg is similar between SL and LL groups.\nHowever, the DSL group demonstrates lower flow rates as a result of edema in the perfusion\nlivers. P<0.05 for random intercept mixed model analysis indicated by � for comparison\nbetween DSL and SL, and ϕ for LL and SL groups. LL, control lean livers; SL, control steatotic\nlivers; DSL, defatted steatotic livers.\n(EPS)\nPLOS ONE\nImproving function of steatotic livers for transplant with defatting and machine perfusion\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0232886 May 12, 2020 15 / 19\n\nS1 Table.

The authors compared the results of three groups: untreated steatotic livers, livers treated with a defatting regimen prior to transplantation, and livers treated with both the defatting regimen and machine perfusion. They found that the addition of machine perfusion significantly improved liver function and reduced the need for postoperative immunosuppression in the third group. The study suggests that combining defatting and machine perfusion may offer a promising approach for improving the utilization of steatotic livers in transplantation. Key findings include improvements in liver function, reductions in steatosis and inflammation, and enhanced mitochondrial activity in the treated livers. The authors also noted that further studies are needed to confirm these findings and optimize the protocol for clinical implementation. Overall, the study provides encouraging evidence for the potential benefits of this novel therapeutic strategy for expanding the donor pool and reducing waiting times for liver transplant recipients."}

Friend1\n* for the Consortium for Organ \nPreservation in Europe\nLiver transplantation is a highly successful treatment, but is severely limited by the shortage in donor organs. However, \nmany potential donor organs cannot be used; this is because sub-optimal livers do not tolerate conventional cold storage \nand there is no reliable way to assess organ viability preoperatively. Normothermic machine perfusion maintains the liver \nin a physiological state, avoids cooling and allows recovery and functional testing. Here we show that, in a randomized trial \nwith 220 liver transplantations, compared to conventional static cold storage, normothermic preservation is associated \nwith a 50% lower level of graft injury, measured by hepatocellular enzyme release, despite a 50% lower rate of organ \ndiscard and a 54% longer mean preservation time. There was no significant difference in bile duct complications, graft \nsurvival or survival of the patient. If translated to clinical practice, these results would have a major impact on liver \ntransplant outcomes and waiting list mortality.\nLiver transplantation is the accepted treatment for end-stage liver \nfailure, with one and five year survivals in excess of 90% and 70%, \nrespectively1\n. With increasing rates of liver disease2\n, the supply of \ntransplantable organs is no longer able to meet demand. Paradoxically, \ndespite substantial waiting list mortality (for example, 21% in the UK), \nonly 63% of UK deceased donor livers are transplanted1\n. Increasing \nnumbers of deceased organ donors in many countries have not been \nmatched by a corresponding rise in the number of transplantable \norgans. This is mainly because these additional donors tend to be \nhigh-risk—either declared dead by cardiovascular criteria (DCD), as \nopposed to brainstem death donors (DBD), or elderly with multiple \nco-morbidities (extended criteria donors). Such organs pose a greater \nrisk to the recipient, with a higher probability that the liver will never \nfunction (primary non-function (PNF)) or that it will lead to later com￾plications, particularly biliary stricturing.\nDespite many advances in liver transplantation, the method of \norgan preservation has changed very little in almost 30 years3\n. The \nliver is flushed and cooled with specialist preservation fluid, then \nstored in an icebox. This process of static cold storage (SCS) has \nseveral limitations. Although SCS slows metabolism by 10- to 12-fold, \nsubstantial anaerobic activity continues even at ice temperature4\n. \nThis leads to ATP depletion and accumulation of succinate and other \nmetabolites. These lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species5\nthat are the basis of ischaemia–reperfusion injury, when the organ \nis re-exposed to oxygenated blood at the time of transplantation. \nThis damage, exacerbated by any prior injury, limits the maximum safe \npreservation time of the donor organ. Once cooled, the cessation of \nnormal cellular activity also makes functional assessment impossible.\nThese shortcomings are particularly problematic in the higher-risk \ndonor organs that form an increasing proportion of current liver \ntransplant practice. The very severe ischaemia–reperfusion-related \nmorbidity that characterizes transplantation of such organs is now a \nmajor limitation in meeting the demand for life-saving transplants. To \ncombat the limitations imposed by cold storage, a change in preser￾vation technology is required. In recent years, interest has developed \nin perfusion at physiological temperature (normothermic machine \nperfusion (NMP))6–9\n.\nDuring NMP, the liver is perfused with oxygenated blood, med￾ications and nutrients at normal body temperature to maintain a \nphysiological milieu. Evidence from animal models of both DBD \nand DCD liver transplantation10,11 suggests that this improves \nthe post-transplant survival of transplanted livers, and potentially \nenables the assessment of organ viability during preservation. The \nmechanism underlying these improved outcomes is at least partly \nrelated to the metabolic resuscitation of the organ that occurs with \npreservation under physiological conditions. This has been demon￾strated through the replenishment of ATP levels11, which in turn con￾tributes to a reduction in the severity of the ischaemia–reperfusion \ninjury that is experienced after transplant5,10.\nThere is increasing interest in the clinical application of NMP, with \nseveral cases described in the recent literature6,7\n.

This was used as the precursor to the pres￾ent study which, to our knowledge, is the first randomized controlled \ntrial to test the efficacy of machine perfusion against conventional cold \nstorage in liver transplantation.\nLivers from adult DBD or DCD donors were eligible for enrolment. \nAdult patients awaiting a liver-only transplant, excluding those with \nfulminant liver failure, were eligible. If a suitable liver was allocated \nto a consented recipient, the liver was randomized to either conven￾tional SCS or NMP. In the SCS arm, the organ retrieval, storage and \nthe transplant were conducted according to standard practice. In the \nNMP arm, following removal from the donor, the liver was attached to \nthe OrganOx metra NMP device, where it was perfused throughout the \nduration of preservation (Fig. 1), until the transplanting surgeon was \nready to implant it, at which point it was removed from the device. The \nremainder of the recipient’s care followed standard practice.\nDaily during the first postoperative week, and at day 10, day 30, \nmonth 6 and month 12, biochemical results were recorded as well as \ngraft and patient survival data. At six months, a magnetic resonance \nimaging scan of the biliary tree (MRCP) was performed to assess evi￾dence of biliary injury. Biological samples were collected and stored in \na biobank from each liver and recipient enrolled in the study, for use \nin further mechanistic studies.\nThe primary endpoint was defined as the difference between the two \ntreatment arms in the peak level of serum aspartate transaminase (AST) \nwithin seven days after transplant. This hepatocellular enzyme is a clini￾cally accepted biomarker, predictive of graft and patient survival12.\nRecruitment\nBetween 26 June 2014 and 8 March 2016, 334 livers were randomized, \nwith 64 livers subsequently excluded (Fig. 2). Following organ retrieval, \na markedly different discard rate between the two trial arms resulted in \n100 SCS and 120 NMP livers available for primary outcome reporting, \nwith 101 SCS and 121 NMP livers available for secondary outcome anal￾ysis. This discrepancy in group size reduced the study power to 89.7%.\nOne NMP liver was cold stored due to an accessory left hepatic artery \narising from the aorta preventing effective cannulation. Eight NMP \nlivers received machine perfusion for less than four hours (for logistic \nrather than technical reasons). All of these organs are included in the \nNMP arm as part of the modified intention to treat analysis. For the \nper protocol sensitivity analysis, the eight livers perfused for less than \nfour hours were excluded and the single NMP liver that was preserved \nusing SCS was reassigned to the SCS group.\nDonor, preservation and recipient characteristics\nNMP and SCS donor and recipient groups were well-matched (Tables 1, 2). \nThe discard rate was higher in the SCS arm (24.1%; 32 out of 133) \nthan the NMP arm (11.7%; 16 out of 137; Extended Data Table 1). \nThis difference was statistically significant (−12.4%, 95% confidence \ninterval −21.4 to −3.3%; P=0.008). One NMP discard was the result \nof a device malfunction in an already marginal organ (hepatic artery \nhypoperfusion due to pinch valve miscalibration; see Supplementary \nInformation).\nFunctional warm ischaemia time applies only to DCD livers and was \nmeasured as the time from the onset of donor hypoxia (oxygen satu￾ration<70%) or hypoperfusion (systolic blood pressure<50mmHg) \nuntil the start of cold aortic perfusion in the donor. The median \nfunctional warm ischaemia time was longer for NMP than SCS livers \n(21min versus 16min; P=0.003).\nTotal preservation time was measured from the start of cold aortic \nperfusion in the donor until graft reperfusion in the recipient. The \nmedian total preservation time was longer for NMP than SCS liv￾ers (11 h 54 min versus 7 h 45 min; P < 0.001). Within the NMP \narm, there was no significant difference in median perfusion time \nbetween DBD and DCD livers (9 h 55 min DBD versus 8 h 45 min \nDCD; P=0.449).\nPost-reperfusion haemodynamics were documented in 218 cases: \npost-reperfusion syndrome was more common in the SCS (32 out of \n97) than the NMP group (15 out of 121), a statistically significant dif￾ference (–20.6%, 95% confidence interval –31.6 to –9.5%; P<0.001). \nThis was despite reduced requirement for vasopressors in NMP livers \nin the post-reperfusion period (Extended Data Table 2a–c).\nIVC\nPV\nCBD\nGB\nHA\nFig. 1 | Image of liver during normothermic machine perfusion.\nThe hepatic artery (HA), portal vein (PV), inferior vena cava (IVC) and \ncommon bile duct (CBD) are all cannulated.

Unadjusted analysis (Student’s t-test) and sensitivity analysis \nundertaken in the per-protocol population confirmed these results.\nSubgroup analysis showed that the effect of NMP was different in \nthe two donor types (test for interaction P=0.012), although it was \nstatistically significant in both subgroups; the reduction in geometric \nmean peak AST was greater in DCD (73.3%, 95% confidence interval \n53.7–84.6%; P<0.001) than in DBD livers (40.2%, 95% confidence \ninterval 19.3–55.7%; P=0.001). Subgroup analyses for the model for \nend-stage liver disease (MELD) score and Eurotransplant-donor risk \nindex (ET-DRI) showed no statistically significant differences (data not \nshown). See Extended Data Table 3a, b and Extended Data Fig. 1 for \nfurther analysis. See Table 3 for full outcome results.\nEarly allograft dysfunction\nData to assess early allograft dysfunction (EAD) rates were available in \n216 recipients: the odds of developing EAD in the NMP arm (12 out of \n119) were 74% lower than the SCS arm (29 out of 97; odds ratio 0.263, \n95% confidence interval 0.126–0.550; P<0.001). A logistic regression \nmodel adjusted for donor type, MELD score and ET-DRI showed that \nthe adjusted odds of EAD in the NMP arm were approximately 72% \nlower than in the cold storage arm (adjusted odds ratio 0.276, 95% \nconfidence interval 0.124–0.611; P=0.002). The difference in EAD \nrates was partly a result of the difference in peak AST (described above), \nbut also a reflection of differences in bilirubin. The median bilirubin \nlevel in the first week postoperatively was lower in NMP recipients \n(2.25mgdl−1\n, 95% confidence interval 1.23–4.28)) than in the SCS \ngroup (2.87mgdl−1\n, 95% confidence interval 1.52–5.00; P=0.029).\nBiliary strictures on MRCP\nAn MRCP was performed on 155 (81 NMP, 74 SCS) of the 222 trans￾planted trial patients. There was no significant difference in the rate of \nnon-anastomotic strictures for DBD (NMP 7.4% (4 out of 54) versus SCS \n5.4% (3 out of 55); P=0.678) or DCD (NMP 11.1% (3 out of 27) versus \nSCS 26.3% (5 out of 19); P=0.180) livers. Only one patient in each trial \narm developed clinically relevant evidence of ischaemic cholangiopathy \nin the first year after transplant, both of whom were re-transplanted.\nTable 1 | Donor demographic details\nStratification factors for all \nrandomized livers NMP (n=170) SCS (n=164)\nDonor typea\nDBD 107 (62.9%) 104 (63.4%)\nDCD 63 (37.1%) 60 (36.6%)\nDonor demographics for all \nretrieved livers\nNMP (n=137) SCS (n=133)\nGendera\nFemale 54 (39.4%) 57 (42.9%)\nMale 81 (59.1%) 76 (57.1%)\nMissing 2 (1.5%) 0 (0.0%)\nAgeb 56 (45–67) (16–84) 56 (47–66) (20–86)\nEthnicitya\nAfrican–Caribbean 3 (2.2%) 1 (0.8%)\nCaucasian 131 (95.6%) 128 (96.2%)\nOther 1 (0.7%) 4 (3.0%)\nMissing 2 (1.5%) 0 (0.0%)\nCause of death\nCVA 74 (54.0%) 74 (55.6%)\nHypoxia 30 (21.9%) 32 (24.1%)\nTrauma 17 (12.4%) 16 (12.0%)\nOther 14 (10.2%) 11 (8.3%)\nMissing 2 (1.5%) 0 (0.0%)\nBody mass indexb 26.26 (23.66–30.52) \n(16.42–46.65)\n27.01 (23.74–30.56) \n(17.24–49.96)\nMissing 2 (1.5%) 0 (0.0%)\nET-Donor risk indexb 1.72 (1.47–2.09) \n(0.98–4.31)\n1.72 (1.50–2.10) \n(1.06–3.49)\nMissing 16 (11.7%) 19 (14.3%)\nCVA, cerebrovascular accident.\naFrequency and column percentages are reported.\nbMedian, interquartile range (IQR, first brackets) and full range (second brackets) are reported.\nTable 2 | Preservation and recipient demographic details\nPreservation details for all \ntransplanted livers NMP (n=121) SCS (n=101) P valuea\nFunctional warm ischaemia timeb\n(min) (applies to DCD livers; \nn=55 (34 NMP, 21 SCS))\n21 (17–25) \n(9–93)\n16 (10–20) \n(2–32)\n0.003\nCold ischaemia time prior to \nNMP (min)c\n (n=120)\n126 \n(106.5–143.0) \n(49–218)\nNA\nMachine perfusion time (min)c\n(n=120)\n547.5 \n(372.5–710.5) \n(85–1,388)\nNA\nTotal preservation time from \ncross-clamp in donor to organ \nreperfusion in recipient (min)\n714 (542–876) \n(258–1,527)\n465 \n(375–575) \n(223–967)\n0.0000\nSteatosis assessed \npre-preservationd,e\n0.366\nNone or mild 91 (75.3%) 89 (88.2%)\nModerate or severe 29 (24%) 12 (11.9%)\nMissing 1 (0.8%)\nRecipient demographics NMP (n=121) SCS (n=101) P valuea\nGenderd 0.717\nFemale 35 (28.9%) 27 (26.7%)\nMale 86 (71.1%) 74 (73.3%)\nDonor typed 0.209\nDBD 87 (71.9%) 80 (79.2%)\nDCD 34 (28.1%) 21 (20.8%)\nAgec 55 (48–62) \n(20–72)\n55 (48–62) \n(22–70)\n0.713\nCause of liver failured 0.782\nAlcoholic 36 (29.8%) 29 (28.7%)\nAuto-immune hepatitis 2 (1.7%) 5 (5.0%)\nHepatitis B 3 (2.5%) 2 (2.0%)\nHepatitis C 4 (3.3%) 4 (4.0%)\nHepatocellular carcinoma on \nbackground of cirrhosis\n15 (12.4%) 16 (15.8%)\nNon-alcoholic steato-hepatitis 11 (9.1%) 11 (10.9%)\nPrimary biliary cirrhosis 10 (8.3%) 3 (3.0%)\nPrimary sclerosis cholangitis 18 (14.9%) 13 (12.9%)\nOther 22 (18.1%) 18 (17.8%)\nBody mass indexc 26.18 \n(23.12–32.39) \n(18.02–50.99)\n26.94 \n(24.36–30.42) \n(18.91–42.95)\n0.626\nMissing 0 (0.0%) 1 (1.0%)\nRetransplantd 12 (9.9%) 8 (7.9%) 0.605\nMELD scorec\n (calculated at time \nof transplant)\n13 (10–18) \n(6–35)\n14 (9–18) \n(6–29)\n0.970\nUK 13 (10–17) \n(6–33)\n14 (9–18) \n(6–28)\nEssen, Germany 17 (14–19) \n(13–23)\n15.5 (14–17) \n(14–17)\nBarcelona, Spain 16 (8–26) \n(8–35)\n14 (9–16) \n(8–29)\nLeuven, Belgium 19 (13.5–25.0) \n(13–26)\n16 (16–20) \n(9–27)\neGFRc 87.36 \n(69.61–107.66) \n(33.45–156.43)\n92.22 (69.72–\n104.24) \n(30.19–\n155.04)\n0.928\nMissing 4 (3.3%) 3 (3.0%)\nET-Donor risk indexc 1.70 \n(1.47–2.07) \n(0.98–4.31)\n1.71 \n(1.50–2.01) \n(1.06–3.49)\n0.610\nMissing 13 (10.7%) 13 (12.9%)\nNA, not applicable. eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate.\naχ2 tests and non-parametric Mann–Whitney U-tests were used for categorical and continuous \nvariables, respectively.

The measured haemo￾dynamic parameters were: hepatic artery flow (280±120mlmin−1\n) \nand portal vein flow (1.11 ± 0.2 l min−1\n). The measured meta￾bolic parameters were: pH (7.31±0.17) and lactate clearance from \n9.99±3.13mmol l\n−1\n at 15min NMP to 0.93±0.63mmol l\n−1\n by 4h \nNMP. The measured synthetic parameter consisted of bile production \n(9.17±11.16mlh−1\n). Notably, 18 transplanted NMP livers produced \nno/minimal bile during perfusion. All but one of these functioned \nafter transplant. There was no correlation between bile production and \npost-transplant liver function or later development of non-anastomotic \nbiliary strictures.\nOne NMP liver developed PNF. This liver was persistently acidotic \nwith lactate>4mmol for the duration of NMP. No other liver with \nthese characteristics was transplanted.\nFollowing transplant, 28 livers displayed minimal preservation \ninjury (MPI; peak AST<250 IU l−1\n) and 25 showed evidence of \nsevere preservation injury (SPI; peak AST>1,000 IU l−1\n). The donors \nin these groups were well-matched in all characteristics other than \nsex (Extended Data Table 4). During NMP, there was a difference in \nbaseline perfusate alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (MPI 171 IU l−1\nversus SPI 669 IU l−1\n; P=0.005) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) \n(MPI 1,073 IU l−1\n versus SPI 1,838 IU l−1\n; P=0.01) between the two \ngroups. Levels of these enzymes, as well as γ-glutamyltransferase (γGT), \nincreased more rapidly during the first 8h of NMP in the SPI group \n(ALT, an increase of 56 IU l−1\n versus an increase of 461 IU l−1\n, P<0.001; \nLDH, an increase of 483 IU l−1\n versus an increase of 980 IU l−1\n, \nP=0.06; γGT, an increase of 23 IU l−1\n versus increase of 104 IU l−1\n, \nP=0.004). MPI livers showed a reduction in measurable levels of \nhaemolysis (haemolysis index) as NMP progressed, in contrast to SPI \nlivers in which the levels of haemolysis rose (MPI, a decrease of 0.04 U \nversus SPI, an increase of 0.09 U; P=0.03). Bile production was greater \nin the MPI group (MPI 13.1mlh−1\n versus SPI 7.8mlh−1\n; P=0.03). \nLactate clearance was similar in each group. Post-reperfusion syndrome \nwas less common in the MPI group (MPI 0% (0 out of 28) versus SPI \n24% (6 out of 25); P=0.007). One NMP liver with perfusate transami￾nases in excess of 20,000 IU l−1\n was transplanted successfully.\nAdverse events\nThe proportion of patients for whom adverse events were reported \n(Extended Data Tables 5a–c, 6) was similar in the two arms (55.4% \nNMP, 95% confidence interval 46.1–64.4% versus 57.4% SCS, 95% \nconfidence interval, 47.2–67.2%) with a larger total number of events \nreported for SCS livers (128 NMP versus 164 SCS). Of these, a greater \nproportion of the serious adverse events (Clavien–Dindo grade ≥IIIb) \nwere in the SCS than NMP arm (16.4% NMP (21 out of 128) versus \n22% SCS (36 out of 164)). No statistical tests were applied to these data.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial to com￾pare any type of machine perfusion technology with conventional static \ncold storage in human liver transplantation.\nThe trial demonstrated significant reductions in peak AST and EAD \nrates in NMP livers; this is of clinical relevance as both are clinically \naccepted biomarkers for long-term graft and patient survival12,13. \nThese benefits are consistent with previous animal work10 and the \nphase-I clinical study9\n that preceded this trial, both of which showed \npost-transplant AST reductions in NMP livers. No differences were \nseen in graft or patient survival: a much larger trial is required to test \nthis outcome. It is notable that these reductions in peak AST and EAD \nrates were achieved in the context of improved organ utilization and \nlonger preservation times, both of which have implications in terms \nof addressing the donor shortage and logistical barriers that currently \nlimit liver transplants.\nDCD donors represent a largely untapped source of organs, com￾prising 42% of UK deceased donors, but only 21% of transplanted \nlivers14. Utilization of DCD livers is limited by poorer outcomes (PNF \nand ischaemic cholangiopathy) compared with DBD livers. Allowing \nthe limitations of small group analyses, in this study NMP DCD liver \nprimary outcome data were superior to those of both DCD and DBD \nlivers preserved using SCS. In fact, the primary outcome of DCD NMP \nlivers was superior to that of DBD livers preserved by NMP: this was \npossibly owing to a selection bias, both of donors (lower threshold \nto decline DCD donors) and recipients (fitter patients selected for \nhigher-risk organs). The AST differences are in the context of longer \nfunctional warm ischaemia times, longer preservation times and fewer \norgan discards in the NMP arm, suggesting that NMP may be achieving \nthe desired objective of increasing organ utilization without compro￾mising outcome. If these findings were translated into clinical practice, \nthe increase in organ utilization would have substantial implications \nfor waiting list mortality, which is currently approximately one in five \npatients1\n.\nThe longer preservation times in the NMP group were not planned, \nbut were all within the maximum perfusion time defined in the pro￾tocol. There was no stipulation in the trial protocol that the preser￾vation times should be matched. As clinicians gained experience, it \nappeared that some centres had started to organize their operating \nschedule according to the preservation method, although no overall \ndifference between arms was seen in the proportion of transplants \noccurring in daylight hours. If, as appears to be the case, NMP can \nsafely extend preservation times without compromising outcomes, this \nwill have implications for operating department planning as well as \norgan utilization.\nThere were over 50% fewer discarded organs in the NMP group, \nresulting in 20% more transplanted livers (121 NMP versus 101 SCS). \nThe SCS discard rate of 23.7% was higher than the 17% reported in \nUK registry data14, and may reflect the high proportion of DCD livers \nenrolled in the trial; the discard rate of retrieved DCD livers in the UK \nis 30%14. This reported difference in organ utilization is likely to be an \nunderestimation of the full potential impact that NMP could have on \ntransplant numbers. The trial stipulated that only livers considered \ntransplantable according to standard practice could be enrolled. For \nthe full extent of improved organ utilization to be measured, livers \nwould need to be randomized to NMP or SCS before being offered for \ntransplant; this should form the basis of a future study. An increase of \n20% or more in the number of transplantable donor livers would have \na transformative effect on the mortality on liver transplant waiting lists \naround the world.\nThe haemodynamic characteristics of the NMP recipients following \nreperfusion were measurably superior to those of SCS recipients, in line \nwith previously reported findings15. This did not translate into a differ￾ence in ICU stay, hospital stay or need for renal replacement therapy \nbetween the two groups, despite previous reports showing a correlation \nbetween peak AST and renal replacement therapy16. The magnitude of \nthe reperfusion syndrome is a factor in determining the eligibility of the \nsickest patients for high-risk organs, due to the limited capacity of such \npatients to tolerate cardiovascular instability; NMP might therefore \nincrease the options for the most urgent patients.\nPerhaps the greatest limitation to more widespread utilization of \nDCD livers is the high rate of clinically important non-anastomotic \nbiliary strictures (NAS) which lead to a high rate of graft failure; this \nis believed to develop due to the vulnerability of the biliary tree to \nprolonged warm ischaemia. The rate of NAS in the NMP DCD group \n(11.1%) was lower than in SCS (26.3%) livers, despite longer functional \nwarm ischaemia times. This did not reach statistical significance, which \nmay be a function of sample size; the trial was not powered for this \noutcome. Reported rates of NAS in DCD transplants vary from 10 \nto 30%17,18, but these are in patients with symptoms suggesting bil￾iary pathology, rather than those only apparent on imaging; biliary \n54 | NA T U RE | VO L 557 | 3 MAY 2018\n© 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Prior to this study, the radiolog￾ical incidence of both anastomotic and non-anastomotic strictures in \nasymptomatic patients was unknown; in particular, there is no real \nbenchmark against which to compare the rate of NAS seen in the DCD \nSCS group. Apart from the two patients retransplanted for ischaemic \ncholangiopathy, almost all of the remaining patients with radiological \nevidence of NAS had normal liver function at one year; this questions \nthe clinical relevance of a protocol MRCP at six months. The longer￾term follow-up of these patients will shed light on the importance of \na radiological diagnosis of biliary stricturing in patients with normal \ngraft function, and the role of MRCP as an endpoint in future trials.\nAs well as demonstrating improved graft preservation, this trial \ntested the feasibility, usability and safety of NMP, a vital component of \nthe evaluation of any new technology. It showed that the logistical chal￾lenges of NMP can be met successfully within clinical practice. Over \n120 NMP livers were transplanted in seven transplant centres across \nfour European countries. Nonetheless, adoption of this technology \ninto clinical practice may necessitate changes in the organ retrieval \nprocess, particularly with respect to technical support and transport \narrangements. It remains to be seen whether NMP is required for the \nfull duration of an organ’s preservation or can equally well be applied \nafter a short period of SCS when the organ reaches the transplanting \ncentre—this would simplify the logistics but may not be suitable for \nthe most marginal organs19. A phase-II study to test this has recently \ncompleted enrolment in the UK (NCT03176433).\nFor this new technology to be supported by healthcare funders, a \nhealth–economic case is needed. The results of this study suggest that \nbenefits will accrue not only from improved early graft function and \ntransplantation logistics, but also from improved utilization. Secondary \neconomic benefits will accrue from logistic changes, enabling trans￾plants to be moved predominantly into daytime operating, with reduc￾tion in staffing costs and likely improvements in outcome. More timely \nintervention will also bring economic benefits—earlier transplantation \nis associated with lower morbidity and cost.\nThe effects of NMP demonstrated in this study are unequivocal with \nrespect to the primary endpoint, implying a benefit in livers currently \nused for transplantation. However, the greatest benefit may be realized \nby applying this technology to livers outside current acceptance crite￾ria, in order to transplant organs currently deemed untransplantable. \nAlgorithms to assess organ viability, based on data obtained during \nNMP, will be essential if this potential is to be realized10. This study \nsheds some light on which perfusion parameters may be used to assess \norgan quality: bile production, acid–base stability, lactate clearance, \nperfusate transaminase levels, falling measurable haemolysis—all \ncorrelate with the degree of preservation injury evident after trans￾plant. However, all but one of the livers transplanted in the NMP group \nfunctioned postoperatively, including one NMP liver with perfusate \ntransaminases in excess of 20,000 IU l−1\n and 18 livers with minimal \nbile production. Data from much larger numbers of NMP transplants \n(typically from a registry) would be required to determine specific \nmarkers of viability.\nThe importance of bile production during NMP is unclear. \nPreliminary evidence from our group20 suggests that preservation \ninjury causes impaired hepatocellular uptake of bile salts. We have \nshown evidence of progressive accumulation of bile salts in the perfu￾sate of livers with high post-transplant transaminase levels; something \nthat also correlates with poor bile production during NMP. The extent \nand nature of the injury required to produce this effect is not clear but \ndoes appear to reflect organ quality rather than viability.\nHigh-risk organs (for example, those with steatosis) may benefit from \ntherapeutic interventions delivered during NMP: several groups are \nexploring potential strategies, including stem cell treatments, de-fatting \nagents and immunological modification of the organ. Future trials \nmay be needed to formally test the size of the effect of NMP on organ \nutilization; for this it will be necessary to randomize livers at the time \nof organ offering rather than the time of retrieval. Organ utilization, or \norgan utilization with 12-month graft survival (functional utilization) \nwould be a logical primary endpoint for a study of this sort.\nThis study describes the formal clinical evaluation of a novel tech￾nology in liver transplantation, and could herald the start of a new era \nof intervention during organ preservation. It represents a first, neces￾sary step in demonstrating that NMP is feasible, safe and effective in \nclinical practice; the fact that the study has definitively met its primary \nendpoint should now enable the exploration of the technology’s wider \npotential.\nOnline content\nAny Methods, including any statements of data availability and Nature Research \nreporting summaries, along with any additional references and Source Data files, \nare available in the online version of the paper at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-\n018-0047-9.\nReceived: 28 September 2017; Accepted: 8 March 2018; \nPublished online 18 April 2018.\n1.

Approval was obtained from national research ethics commit￾tees and medical device regulatory bodies in each trial region, in particular the \nLondon–Dulwich National Research Ethics Committee (NREC) and the Medicines \nand Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK; the Federaal Agentschap \nvoor Geneesmiddelen en Gezondheidsproducten (FAGG) and the Commissie \nMedische Ethiek of Universitaire Ziekenhuizen, Leuven, Belgium; the Comité \nÉtico de Investigación Clínica of the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona; the Deutsche \nÄrztekammer and the ethics committee of University Hospital Essen, Germany. \nThe trial protocol was registered before recruitment (ISRCTN 39731134). All rel￾evant ethical regulations relating to the conduct of this study were followed at \neach trial site. The trial is reported in accordance with the CONSORT statement21.\nNo major amendments were made to the trial design after the start of recruit￾ment.\nEligibility and consent. Inclusion criteria for donors and recipients were deliber￾ately broad to represent the full spectrum of clinical practice. Whole livers from \nDBD and DCD (Maastricht category III22) donors at least 16 years of age were \neligible. Specific donor consent was not required for trial inclusion. No organs \nwere procured from prisoners. Recipients were eligible provided they were at least \n18 years old and listed for a liver-only transplant, excluding those with fulminant \nliver failure, owing to the poor prognosis of this group regardless of organ quality. \nPotential participants were consented while on the waiting list; consent was \naffirmed on the day of transplantation. The consent included the recording of \nanonymized data for trial purposes and the collection of biological samples for \nstorage in the trial biobank (see ‘Sample collection’). No patient identifiable data \nwere collected.\nRandomization. Once an eligible donor organ was allocated to a consented recip￾ient and the availability of the NMP device and team was confirmed, the liver \nwas randomized. All clinical decisions thereafter, including graft suitability and \nprocedure scheduling, were made independently of the trial team.\nUsing an online randomization tool, livers were assigned to NMP or SCS with \n1:1 allocation ratio as per a computer-generated randomization schedule, using \nvariable block size, stratified by transplant centre and donor type (DBD/DCD). \nThe unit of randomization was donor livers rather than recipients, but analysis is \nreported for the transplant recipients.\nStatic cold storage group. Livers randomized to SCS were retrieved, preserved, \ntransported and transplanted according to local standard practice.\nNormothermic machine perfusion group. The OrganOx metra normothermic \nliver perfusion device was used (Extended Data Fig. 5a), which enables automated \norgan preservation for up to 24h. Following randomization to NMP, the device and \naccompanying researcher were transported to the donor hospital. The device was \nset-up during the retrieval procedure, as has been previously described9\n. A sterile \ndisposable set was installed on to the device and primed with 500ml gelofusine \n(B. Braun Ltd) and three units of donor-matched packed red blood cells. Antibiotics \nwere given at the outset and heparin, insulin, prostacyclin, bile salts and fat-free \nparenteral nutrition were infused during the perfusion (Extended Data Fig. 5b).\nFollowing retrieval of the donor organ, and while still at the donor hospital, the \nliver back-table operation was performed23, followed by cannulation of the hepatic \nartery, portal vein, inferior vena cava and bile duct. The liver was connected to the \nNMP device and perfusion commenced (Fig. 1). During the early part of the per￾fusion sodium bicarbonate was added incrementally to achieve a physiological pH. \nThe OrganOx metra perfusion device incorporates online blood gas measurement \n(Terumo CD1-500) together with software-controlled algorithms to control PO2\nand PCO2\n (within physiological limits), temperature (37°C), mean arterial pressure \n(65–75mm Hg) and), inferior vena cava pressure (0–2mm Hg). Typical blood \nflows of 200–400mlmin−1\n (artery) and 1,000-1,200mlmin−1\n (portal vein) were \nobtained. Glucose was measured manually and the value entered into the device. \nIf glucose fell below 10mmoll\n−1\n this automatically triggered the infusion of a fat￾free TPN mixture (Nutriflex Special, B. Braun Ltd) into the perfusate.\nNMP continued throughout the duration of transport and storage until the \ntransplanting team were ready to implant the liver. The minimum protocol-stipulated \nNMP duration was 4h, the time needed for ATP repletion in animal studies11. \nThe maximum allowed NMP duration was 24h in line with the experience in the \nphase-I study and the regulatory approval for the device9\n.\nSample collection. Tissue biopsies (donor liver and bile duct), recipient blood \nand urine were collected at pre-specified time points from every liver/transplanted \npatient in the study. In addition to these, samples of perfusate fluid and bile were \ncollected from every NMP liver. These were stored in a central biobank established \nby the COPE Consortium for use in ongoing mechanistic studies. Each sample was \nallocated a unique bar code, which the biobank coordinator was able to match to \na specific trial identification number. No patient identifiable data were associated \nwith each sample.\nStudy end points. The primary endpoint was defined as the difference between the \ntwo treatment arms in the peak level of serum AST within seven days after trans￾plant. This is a clinically accepted biomarker, predictive of primary non-function \nas well as graft and patient survival12,24 and is also associated with histological \nevidence of moderate to severe perfusion injury25,26.\nA surrogate marker of graft survival was used in this trial for two reasons: (1) \nthe relatively high survival rates in liver transplantation (>90%) and (2) the mul￾tifactorial causes of graft loss. A trial based directly on graft or patient survival \nwould have had to be unfeasibly large.\nIn order to ensure consistency and to minimise the hypothetical AST ‘wash-out’ \neffect in the NMP-treated organs, the first post-transplantation value was measured \nbetween 12 and 24h after reperfusion.\nSecondary end points included: (1) organ discard rate (after retrieval); (2) \npost-reperfusion syndrome27:>30% drop in mean arterial pressure persisting \nfor>1min within five minutes of reperfusion; (3) primary non-function: irre￾versible graft dysfunction, for non-technical and non-immunological causes, lead￾ing to death or emergency liver replacement during the first 10 days after liver \ntransplantation; (4) early allograft dysfunction13 as indicated by any one of the \nfollowing clinical indicators: (i) bilirubin>170 μmol l−1\n on day 7 after transplant; \n(ii) INR>1.6 on day 7 after transplant; (iii) peak-AST>2,000 IU l−1\n during the \nfirst 7 days; (4) length of hospital and ICU stays; (5) need for renal replacement \ntherapy; (6) evidence of cholangiopathy on MRCP at six months; (7) graft and \npatient survival at one year.\nFull details of all secondary outcomes are available in the trial protocol28.\nSix-month MRCP. An MRCP scan was performed six months (range \n5–7 months) after transplant to evaluate the biliary tree for features of cholangiopathy \nevident by biliary strictures. All scans were reviewed by two independent radio￾logists blinded to the method of organ preservation with disparities adjudicated \nby a third radiologist. Owing to the lack of any existing grading system for biliary \nstrictures, a system was agreed to in advance by consensus among the radiolo￾gists to allow definitive categorization of the presence and site of strictures. The \nfindings were reported as follows: (1) normal biliary tree; (2) anastomotic stric￾ture (>70% of luminal diameter); (3) unequivocal evidence of non-anastomotic \nstricture anywhere in the biliary tree; (4) both anastomotic and non-anastomotic \nbiliary strictures.\nStatistical analysis. Previous data from Universitaetsklinikum Essen, Germany \n(A.Pau. & S.R.K., unpublished observations), demonstrated the geometric mean of \npeak AST to be 608.59 IU l−1\n in patients transplanted following SCS. The present \nstudy was powered to detect a (clinically relevant) 33% reduction in peak AST \nwith 90% power at a 5% significance level, requiring 220 transplanted livers (110 \nper arm).\nResults are reported as a modified intention-to-treat analysis. A per-protocol \nsensitivity analysis was also performed excluding livers that received machine per￾fusion outside the protocol specified range (4–24h) and comparing the groups \naccording to the treatment actually received. Livers randomized but not retrieved \nwere excluded from the analysis.\nPrimary outcome was analysed using ANOVA with adjustment for stratification \nfactors. The peak AST was calculated for each recipient with at least two values \navailable. Missing AST values were not imputed. Binary outcomes were assessed \nusing test for proportions or logistic regression to adjust for potential confounders \nand report odds ratios. Continuous outcomes were compared using a Student’s \nt-test, if normally distributed, or by Mann–Whitney U-test otherwise. Time-to￾event outcomes were analysed using Kaplan–Meier estimates and log-rank tests. \nOutcomes are reported with 95% confidence intervals and P values to three decimal \nplaces. P<0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.\nPre-specified subgroup analyses were performed for donor type (DCD versus \nDBD), donor risk index (ET-DRI) and MELD score using tests for interaction and \nreported using forest plots. Interaction methods were used to look for consistency \nof treatment effect across the different subgroups and reported using forest plots. \nThe study was not powered to detect differences in the subgroups; these results \nshould only be regarded as hypothesis-generating.\nAnalyses were conducted using Stata version 14.2 (StataCorp).\nNo formal interim analyses of end points were carried out. At regular intervals, \nan independent Data Monitoring Committee reviewed confidential reports cov￾ering recruitment, safety parameters and primary end point data.\nFull details of the statistical methodology are available in the Supplementary \nInformation.\nMachine perfusion parameters.

The trial protocol did not stipulate the manner in which these \nparameters should be interpreted.\nOnce trial recruitment was complete, an ad hoc analysis was performed in which \nNMP organs were categorized according to those which, following transplantation, \ndisplayed minimal preservation injury (MPI; peak AST<250 IU l−1\n) and those \nwith severe preservation injury (SPI; peak AST>1,000 IU l−1\n). Groups were com￾pared for differences in donor and recipient characteristics, perfusate biochemistry, \nbile production and evidence of post-reperfusion syndrome.\nAdverse events. Reporting of adverse events was in accordance with the European \nCommission MEDDEV guidelines29. Following trial completion, these were \nreviewed by two independent clinicians blinded to the treatment arm. Adverse \nevents with a Clavien-Dindo30 grading greater than IIIa were considered serious \nadverse events.

Sample size\nDescribe how sample size was determined. Data from 416 liver transplant recipients from University Hospital Essen \ndemonstrated the geometric mean of peak AST to be 608.59 IU/L (the geometric \nmean is used as peak AST is non-normally distributed). 220 transplants (110 per \narm) would have 90% power at 5% significance level to detect a 33% reduction (to \n401.67 IU/L) in the geometric mean of peak AST. Thus the trial required a sample \nsize of 220 livers to be transplanted and reach the primary endpoint. \nOnce trial recruitment was complete, an ad hoc analysis was performed in which \nNMP organs were categorised according to those which, following transplant, \ndisplayed minimal preservation injury (MPI; peak AST <250 IU/litre; n=28) and \nthose with more severe preservation injury (SPI; peak AST >1000 IU/litre; n=25). \n2. Data exclusions\nDescribe any data exclusions. Inclusion criteria for donors and recipients were deliberately broad to represent \nthe full spectrum of clinical practice. Whole livers from brainstem death (DBD) and \ncirculatory death (DCD) donors aged at least 16 years were eligible. \nRecipients were eligible provided they were at least 18 years old and listed for a \nliver-only transplant, excluding those with fulminant liver failure, due to their poor \nprognosis regardless of organ quality. \n3. Replication\nDescribe whether the experimental findings were \nreliably reproduced.\nThis is the first phase 3 randomised controlled trial to compare any form of \nmachine perfusion technology with static cold storage in human liver \ntransplantation. This findings have broadly confirmed those demonstrated in small \nscale animal studies and in small retrospectively matched case series. \nThis was a clinical trial not involving experiments that need replication.\n4. Randomization\nDescribe how samples/organisms/participants were \nallocated into experimental groups.\nOnce an eligible donor organ was allocated to a consented recipient and the \navailability of the normothermic liver perfusion (NMP) team was confirmed, the \nliver was randomised. All clinical decisions thereafter, including graft suitability and \nprocedure scheduling, were made independently of the trial team. \nUsing an online randomisation tool, livers were assigned to NMP or static cold \nstorage with 1:1 allocation ratio as per a computer generated randomisation \nschedule using variable block size, stratified by transplant centre and donor type \n(DBD/DCD). The unit of randomisation was donor livers rather than recipients, but \nanalysis is reported for the transplant recipients.\n5. Blinding\nDescribe whether the investigators were blinded to \ngroup allocation during data collection and/or analysis.\nThis was an open label study. Due to the nature of the intervention (large machine \nperfusion device), it was not possible to blind investigators as to which arm the \nliver had been randomised. .\nNote: all studies involving animals and/or human research participants must disclose whether blinding and randomization were used.\n\n2nature research | life sciences reporting summary June 2017\n6.

Donor livers from deceased individuals were randomly assigned to either NMP or CCS based on eligibility and center/donor type stratification. The primary endpoint was the peak level of serum aspartate transaminase (AST) within seven days after transplantation, which is a clinically accepted biomarker predictive of graft and patient survival. The study found that NMP significantly reduced the peak AST by 49.4% compared to CCS when adjusted by center and donor type. The study involved 335 donor livers, with 137 included in the intention-to-treat analysis and 121 included in the per-protocol sensitivity analysis. The study confirmed previous findings from animal studies and smaller retrospective matched case series. The study was not a clinical trial involving experiments that needed replication, and due to the nature of the intervention, it was not possible to blind investigators as to which arm the liver had been randomized. The NMP device used in the study is now CE marked and available through the manufacturing company, OrganOx Ltd. No antibodies were used in the study, and no eukaryotic cell lines or animals were utilized. The study population consisted of deceased donors aged at least 16 years whose families provided appropriate consent for organ donation, and recipients were eligible if they were at least 18 years old, listed for a liver-only transplant, and did not have fulminant liver failure. Both arms of the study were well matched regarding donor type, age, sex, ethnicity, cause of death, BMI, and Eurotransplant donor risk index, as well as recipient age, sex, cause of liver failure, BMI, retransplants, Model of End-Stage Liver Disease score, and estimated glomerular filtration rate."}

Here we report the VITTAL clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov\nnumber NCT02740608) outcomes, using normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) to\nobjectively assess livers discarded by all UK centres meeting specific high-risk criteria. Thirty￾one livers were enroled and assessed by viability criteria based on the lactate clearance to\nlevels ≤2.5 mmol/L within 4 h.

The incidence of liver disease\nhas risen by 500% over the last 4 decades, however, access to\ntransplantation is limited by the shortage of donor organs1. As a\nconsequence, 240 patients (19%) waiting for liver transplantation\nin the United Kingdom either died or were removed from the\nwaiting list in 2016–20172. Data from the United States shows a\nsimilar pattern, comprising 32% of those listed for transplant\n(3629 patients) within 3 years of listing2,3. The demand for liver\ngrafts has driven the wider use of extended criteria donors4.\nHowever, these are associated with an increased risk of primary\nnon-function or delayed failure5–9, and the acceptance of these\nhigher-risk organs varies widely10. Because of these inferior\noutcomes, and the difficulty of predicting organ viability, many\npotential donor organs remain unutilised. The high waiting list\nmortality justifies the utilisation of more marginal grafts, but\ncurrent practice requires risk mitigation by matching high-risk\nlivers to lower-risk recipients to achieve patient survival rates that\nare acceptable11. Furthermore, the determination of suitability of\na graft for transplantation largely depends on a surgeon’s sub￾jective assessment of the graft’s appearance, using criteria that are\nknown to be unreliable12.\nOrgan preservation currently relies upon cooling to ice tem￾perature to reduce cellular metabolism, and infusing specialist\nsolutions to limit cellular damage. Oxygen deprivation and accu￾mulation of by-products of anaerobic metabolism limit the dura￾tion of storage and result in ischaemia–reperfusion injury at the\ntime of implantation. This process is more severe in marginal\norgans13. Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) has been\nshown to reduce preservation-related graft injury compared to\nstatic cold storage in transplantable livers, according to current\nselection criteria, in a prospective European trial, which also\ndemonstrated increased utilisation of organs14. In NMP, the liver is\nsupplied with oxygen, nutrients and medication at physiological\ntemperature and pressures, maintaining conditions that support\nhomoeostasis, normal metabolic activity and objective assessment\nof function in real-time. Experimental data have shown that end￾ischaemic NMP facilitates replenishment of adenosine tripho￾sphate and glycogen levels. Based on increasing clinical experience,\nviability criteria have emerged; these are objective parameters,\nmeasurable during NMP15. Whilst the feasibility of this approach\nhas been demonstrated in a proof-of-concept series, it has not been\nvalidated in a rigorous clinical trial16,17.\nWe therefore conducted this prospective, non-randomised,\nadaptive phase 2 trial in a large single centre, to evaluate the\npotential of NMP to provide objective assessment of the viability\nof livers currently deemed unsuitable for transplantation, and to\ntransplant those that met predetermined criteria. The primary\nclinical objective underlying this project was the increased and\nsafe utilisation of livers which are currently discarded.\nThe trial demonstrates that viability testing with NMP is fea￾sible, and the objective assessment enables successful transplan￾tation of 71% of perfused discarded livers, with 100% 90-day\npatient and graft survival. The intervention does not seem to\nprevent the development of non-anastomotic biliary strictures in\nlivers donated after circulatory death (DCD) with prolonged\ndonor warm ischaemic times.\nResults\nCharacteristics of discarded liver offers and study participants.\nOver the 16-month study duration from November 2016 to\nFebruary 2018, there were 185 livers discarded for clinical use and\noffered for research. Characteristics of those offers and the study\ninclusion flowchart are provided in Fig. 1a, b.\nOne hundred and sixty-four patients on the waiting list were\napproached for potential participation, of which 53 were\nconsented, and 22 were enroled in the study and received rescued\ngrafts. The potential participants were counselled regarding the\nhigh-risk nature of the project and unknown long-term outcomes\nof resuscitated livers. As a consequence, a proportion of patients\nwere understandably reluctant to participate, and therefore the\nlack of suitable consented recipients was the principal rate limiting\nfactor for inclusion. The number of consented patients at any\ngiven time ranged from 1 to 9; the flow diagram displaying the\nprogress of patients through the trial is shown in Fig. 2.\nDonor liver characteristics and liver biopsy features. In 8 (26%)\ndonors the liver was the only procured organ. All discarded donor\nlivers entered in the study satisfied one or more of the inclusion\nhigh-risk criteria. The livers enroled in the trial consisted of 17\norgans donated after brainstem death (DBD) and 14 DCD. Many\nof these organs looked grossly suboptimal, with some degree of\nsteatosis, capsular fibrosis or rounded edges with multifactorial\nreasons for discard, that was captured by the donor risk index\n(DRI) > 2.0 in 22 (71%) livers, with the median DRI 2.2 (1.9–2.9).\nDetailed characteristics are shown in Table 1 and Supplementary\nTable 1. Photos of all included livers are presented in Fig. 3. The\ntransplanted livers were typically smaller than non-viable ones\n(1.7 vs. 2.0 kg, p = 0.015; Kruskal–Wallis test), with lower peak\npre-mortem donor liver enzyme levels. The median static cold\nstorage time before starting NMP was 7 h:44 min (6:29–10:25).\nOnly 3 (10%) livers were included in the trial primarily for\nmacrosteatosis >30%, (50%, 80% and 60% macrovesicular stea￾tosis combined with 11 h:55 min, 12 h:00 min and 6 h:15 min cold\nischaemia, respectively). Glycogen content and steatosis degree\ndid not predict the viability assessment results. The detailed\nhistological finding of each study liver is provided in Supple￾mentary Table 2.\nPerfusion parameters assessment. During the NMP procedure\n25 livers quickly recovered metabolic activity and cleared lactate\nto the target level (details provided in Fig. 4). A biopsy of a\nsuspicious donor colonic lesion confirmed malignancy, making\none liver unsuitable for transplantation, after meeting the viability\ncriteria. In three livers, criteria were initially met, however,\nmetabolic function thereafter deteriorated within the first 4 h,\nwith increasing lactate. In two cases the transplant procedure was\nnot commenced and the livers were discarded. In the third, the\nexplant had begun, and the procedure continued. Overall, 22\n(71%) livers met the viability criteria and were transplanted fol￾lowing a median total preservation time of 17 h:53 min\n(16:17–21:48; Table 2).\nThe study patients. The majority (64%) of recipients were men,\nand median age was 56 (46–65) years. The leading indication for\ntransplantation was alcohol-related liver disease (36%), followed\nby primary sclerosing cholangitis (27%) and non-alcoholic stea￾tohepatitis (18%). In three (14%) patients the underlying liver\ndisease was complicated by liver cancer. The median UKELD18\nscore was 52 (49–55), with a calculated laboratory MELD score of\n12 (9–16). Details are provided in Table 2 and Supplementary\nTable 3.\nCo-primary study outcomes. Thirty-one livers were enroled into\nthe trial for objective assessment by NMP. Twenty-two of these\nlivers met the viability criteria and were transplanted, resulting in\na significant successful rescue rate of 71% (22/31, 90% Wilson CI:\n56.3–82.2%), to conclude that the procedure is feasible.

Graft 90-day survival was 100%. Seven\n(32%) patients developed early allograft dysfunction, and 7 (32%)\npatients developed Clavien–Dindo complication grade ≥3,\nincluding 4 (18%) cases with acute kidney injury requiring renal\nreplacement therapy. The median intensive care and in-hospital\nstays were 3.5 days (3–4) and 10 days (8–17), respectively. The 1-\nyear patient and graft survival were 100% and 86%, respectively.\nDetails are provided in Table 3.\nVascular and biliary complications. One patient developed an\nintra-operative hepatic artery thrombosis after receiving a DBD\ngraft that had sustained a hepatic arterial injury during procure￾ment. The artery was reconstructed but post-operatively throm￾bosed, undergoing emergency revascularisation which achieved\nlong-lasting arterial patency. The graft, however, developed biliary\nstrictures requiring multiple interventions and eventual re￾transplantation.\nThe per-protocol magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatogra￾phy (MRCP) imaging at 6 months revealed that 2 (9%) patients\ndeveloped anastomotic, and 4 (18%) patients non-anastomotic\nbiliary strictures that presented with cholestatic symptoms. With\nthe exception of the patient with hepatic artery thrombosis, all\nbiliary strictures affected recipients of DCD grafts. During the\nstudy median follow up of 542 days (456–641), 4 patients\nunderwent liver re-transplantation (at day 120, 225, 375 and 417).\nThe details are provided in Table 3 and Supplementary Table 3.\nComparison of outcomes with contemporary matched con￾trols. Patient and graft survival rates at 12 months (100% and\n86%, respectively) were similar to the matched controls (96% and\n86%, respectively) as shown in Fig. 5.

Over the\n16-month study period there were 185 discarded liver research offers, of which 59 (32%) were not eligible for the trial due to an incidental finding of\ncancer, macroscopically apparent cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis, severe organ damage or previous machine perfusion. There were 126 livers suitable for the\ntrial, with steatosis being the leading cause of organ discard with 78 (42%) offers. Stringent donor inclusion criteria were not met in 25 (14%) offers and on\n21 (11%) occasions the research team was already committed to the perfusion of another study liver. A liver was considered for the trial only if it could be\nallocated to a consented, potential blood group- and size-matched low-risk recipient. Many recipients were apprehensive to participate in such a high-risk\nclinical trial, and as a consequence, at any given time there were usually only one to three patients consented. A significant proportion of approached\npatients declined to take part, or were transplanted with a standard quality liver before agreeing to take part in this study. Eventually, thirty-one livers were\nenroled to the trial, of which 22 (71%) grafts met the viability criteria and were successfully transplanted. b A summary of reasons for livers being\ndiscarded in the United Kingdom between November 2016 and February 2018. A total of 64 livers were discarded for severe steatosis on visual\nassessment, with 14 discarded for severe steatosis based on urgent liver biopsy. A percentage of livers were declined due to intra-abdominal or lung\nmalignancies (e.g. colonic cancer in donor 22). This did not include primary brain tumours or small renal cell cancers which are almost always considered\nfor donation. The reasons for logistic discard, include the transplant team already being committed to one or more transplantations, lack of a suitable\nrecipient or too long an anticipated cold ischaemia time due to delays with transportation.\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16251-3 ARTICLE\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2020) 11:2939 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16251-3 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 3\n\nregression). There were no differences in the other assessed\nparameters, including the need for post-transplant renal repla￾cement therapy, hospital stay or incidence of Clavien–Dindo\ngrade ≥ 3 complication rates. The incidence of clinically manifest\nnon-anastomotic biliary strictures was higher in the study group\n(18% vs. 2%, odds ratio 8.0, 95% CI: 0.9–71.6; p = 0.063; condi￾tional logistic regression), although this result needs to be inter￾preted with caution as the matched control patients did not\nreceive systematic bile duct imaging. Due to the small sample\nsizes these comparison results should be interpreted with caution,\nand the controls were included to present the study results within\nthe context of the unit’s contemporary outcomes. The details are\nshown in Table 3.\nDiscussion\nUtilisation of livers from organ donors is currently a major\nchallenge in liver transplantation19. Despite a waiting list mor￾tality in Western countries reaching 20–30%, an increasing pro￾portion of extended criteria livers are unused due to concerns of\nprimary non-function and early graft dysfunction20,21. The\ndecision to discard donor livers is still largely based upon donor\nhistory and subjective assessment by the transplanting surgeon.\nStandard cold static preservation does not allow for any assess￾ment of liver function, and the only other source of information is\nliver histology, which is able to diagnose severe large droplet fatty\nchange, a well-recognised risk factor for non-function21. This\nstudy has demonstrated that moving from subjective evaluation\nto objective testing during NMP might salvage a high proportion\nof those livers that are currently discarded. The need to improve\nthe method by which high-risk livers are assessed was illustrated\nin this study by the absence of significant differences in the donor\ncharacteristics between transplanted and discarded livers.\nThe present trial is the first to systematically investigate\nobjective viability criteria in livers that met specific high-risk\nfeatures in organs initially considered “untransplantable”11,22.\nOne major challenge addressed in the VITTAL trial design was\nthat each discarded liver had to also fulfil one or more pre￾defined objective high-risk criteria, as the considerations for liver\ntransplantability are always multi-factorial, including the reci￾pientʼs condition, logistical aspects and the surgeon’s (or trans￾plant centre’s) experience and risk-taking attitude. The utilisation\nof marginal livers in the United Kingdom was facilitated by the\ncentre-based liver allocation system, allowing the use of high-risk\norgans in any patient on the waiting list. All enroled organs were\nsimultaneously fast-track offered to all UK transplant centres\nfollowing the initial decline, and the fact that none of the seven\ncentres were comfortable using any of the livers included in this\ntrial confirms that these organs were uniformly perceived to be of\nvery poor quality. Our team genuinely aimed to push the\nboundaries of utilisation of the highest risk organs by accessing\nParticipant\nenrollment\nAllocation\nFollow up\nAnalysis\nPatients on waiting list approached and\nassessed for eligibility (n = 164)\nExcluded (n = 111)\nMet exclusion criteria; not suitable for\nmarginal graft (n = 48)\nDeclined to take part (n = 22)\nTransplanted with standard livers prior\nto giving study consent (n = 41)\nConsented (n = 53)\nNo randomisation\nTransplanted with standard livers prior to being\noffered a rescued liver (n = 29)\nPatient remained on waiting list (n = 2)\nTransplanted with VITTAL rescued livers (n = 22)\nPassed stage 1 (3 successes/3 patients) and stage 2\n(11 successes/11 patients) interim assessments\nDiscontinued study following liver\nre-transplantation at day 225 (n = 1)\nTransplanted patients analysed for primary\noutcome (90-day survival) and short-term\nsecondary outcomes (n = 22)\nFig. 2 CONSORT flow diagram displaying the progress of patients through the trial.

Twenty-two patients were enroled in the trial and received a salvaged liver.\nARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16251-3\n4 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2020) 11:2939 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16251-3 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications\n\nthe benefit of rigorous peer-review and continual oversight within\nthe framework of a clinical trial. We included only organs that\nour team did not feel comfortable to use otherwise, and this\nattitude was reflected by the 2-tier liver inclusion process\nembedded in the trial design, and by the fact that 25 livers, that\nwould very likely meet the transplantability criteria, were not\nconsidered for study inclusion. Some of the study livers might\nhave been transplantable if the cold ischaemia was very short and\na suitable recipient was waiting, but currently the majority of\nthese organs are discarded. With the introduction of the National\nAllocation system, logistical constraints exacerbated by static cold\nstorage are increasingly common and prevent the utilisation of a\nrising proportion of marginal livers. In these circumstances, NMP\nmitigates the reperfusion process, allowing assessment of the\norgan during perfusion without exposing patients to the risk of\nprimary non-function. In addition, livers discarded due to hae￾modynamic instability (during procurement or during the pro￾cess of brain stem death itself), high liver transaminases or poor\nin situ flush, benefited from perfusion in a controlled, near\nphysiological environment thereby facilitating their recovery. The\npotential to recondition the liver in the interval between retrieval\nand implantation has hitherto not been possible.\nAn intervention which increases successful utilisation of high￾risk livers will transform access to transplantation to meet pre￾dicted increasing demand, particularly given trends in donor\ndemographics and declining organ quality4.

In 2017–2018, not only\nwere 174 retrieved livers discarded, but 425 livers from solid\norgan donors were not even considered suitable for retrieval (11%\nof DBD and 52% of DCD); it is reasonable to assume that many\nof these would be suitable for testing with NMP. Salvaging a\nproportion of these retrieved but discarded organs would add a\ngood number of transplantable livers annually in the UK, sig￾nificantly reducing waiting list mortality.\nInternational comparisons demonstrate regional variations in\ndonor demographics and there is evidence that in countries with\nhigher initial organ acceptance rates there is also a higher discard\nrate, particularly for older donors23,24. Viability testing provides\nobjective evidence of liver function with clearance of metabolic\nacidosis, vascular flows, glucose parameters and bile production;\nthese give the transplant surgeon the confidence to use these\norgans safely, and minimises the physical and emotional impact\nof non-transplantation for patients.\n1 2 3 4 5\n6 7 8 9 10\n11 12 13 14 15\n16 17 18 19 20\n21 22 23 24 25\n26 27 28 29 30\n31\nFig. 3 The study liver photographs.

Whilst this approach may\nsimplify adoption of the NMP technology without compromising\noutcomes in transplantable livers25, recovery of organs from\ndonors with multiple high-risk features might be further facili￾tated by limiting cold ischaemia through commencing the per￾fusion immediately after procurement in the donor hospital14.\nInevitably there will always be livers that are not suitable for\ntransplantation, demonstrated by 30% of offers with macroscopic\ncirrhosis, biopsy-proven fibrosis or an incidental finding of donor\ncancer. A similar proportion of the livers, however, did not meet\nany of our high-risk criteria and were therefore considered “too\ngood” for inclusion. It is reasonable to assume that NMP\nassessment would have provided the reassurance needed to justify\ntransplantation in this group as well.\nImprovements in transplant logistics is one of the major\nadvantages of NMP14,25,26, and the study allowed for the machine\nperfusion duration to be between 4 h (time needed for the via￾bility assessment) and 24 h (maximum recommended time by the\nperfusion device manufacturer). Once the liver met the viability\ncriteria we aspired to commence the transplantation as soon as\npossible; however, the perfusion was often extended to allow for a\nday-time procedure, or to facilitate transplant logistics in the unit.\nFrom our experience, 4–6 h perfusion seems to be sufficient for\nadequate assessment and replenishment of the organ’s energy\nresources. Due to recirculation of metabolites accumulated in the\norgans during cold ischaemia, the high-risk organs probably do\nnot benefit from prolonged perfusion. The impact of NMP\nduration on livers initially exposed to prolonged cold ischaemia is\nan area of our ongoing research interest.\nTransplant surgeons in many countries are expanding the\ndonor pool with the use of organs donated after circulatory\ndeath27. In the context of liver transplantation, the longevity of\nthese organs might be compromised by development of non￾anastomotic biliary strictures8. The incidence of clinically man￾ifest non-anastomotic biliary strictures in the DCD grafts cohort\nwas 30% (3 out of 10 grafts), higher than the study matched\ncontrols group, but similar to other reported high-risk DCD\nseries28. In concordance with the European prospective nor￾mothermic preservation trial, our results suggested that MRCP\nfindings are likely to over-estimate the incidence of biliary com￾plications14. The per-protocol investigation at the 6-month time\npoint would identify over 80% of the clinically relevant biliary\nstrictures and asymptomatic irregularities with varying clinical\nsignificance28. The presented findings are accurate, as the images\nwere correlated with clinical reviews and liver function tests\nthrough the median follow up of 542 (range: 390–784) days.\nNevertheless, it is clear that end-ischaemic NMP does not prevent\nthe development of non-anastomotic biliary strictures in high￾risk DCD organs, and our outcomes suggest that extending the\ndonor warm times beyond the currently widely accepted limit of\n30 min is not advisable. This finding was not anticipated at the\ntime of trial design or during the conduct of the trial and only\nbecame evident during the long-term follow up of these grafts\nbeyond the primary end point of 90 days. Further work is needed\nto identify new limits (e.g. donor characteristics, warm ischaemia\ntime and cold ischaemia time) and to define perfusion biomarkers\nthat predict this complication and avoid futile transplantation.\nRecently published research suggests that the composition of bile\nproduced during perfusion (pH, bicarbonate and glucose\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n0\n5\n10\nArterial lactate measurement (mmol/L)\n15\nPerfusion time (minutes)\n20\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n0 500 1000 1500\n0 500 1000 1500\n0 500 1000 1500 0 500 1000 1500 0 500 1000 1500 0 500 1000 1500\n123456\n7 8 9 10 11 12\n13 14 15 16 17 18\n19 20 21 22 23 24\n25 26 27 28 29 30\n31\nFig. 4 The study liver lactate clearance.

Sub￾analysis of bile samples and determination of biliary endothelial\nhealth is the subject of ongoing research. Evolving novel perfu￾sion strategies might enable the use of DCD grafts exposed to\nprolonged warm ischaemia14,29,30.\nThe other limitations of our study include the sensitivity of the\ncut-off lactate value, the non-randomised trial design and exclu￾sion of high-risk transplant recipients. Regarding the former,\nfollowing previous experience, we set the lactate viability threshold\nto less than 2.5 mmol/L within 2 h of NMP15,16 To maximise\nutilisation, this trial extended the assessment period to 4 h. Two\nlivers in the trial were discarded following a rise of the perfusate\nlactate after meeting the 2-h target. The significance of this is\nuncertain, although it is notable that a third liver with a similar\npattern of lactate clearance was transplanted and experienced a\nsubstantial period of early allograft dysfunction with a post￾transplant peak ALT of 2074 IU and AST of 3031 IU. Concerning\nthe design, the trial was conducted as a non-randomised study, as\ntransplanting discarded livers with an expected high incidence of\nprimary non-function as controls would be ethically unacceptable.\nWe expect further advances to be achieved through the identifi￾cation of specific biomarkers that correlate with long-term graft\noutcomes, in the context of large NMP series or registries. Lastly,\nas we did not want to compound risks, the study did not include\nhigher risk recipients deemed not suitable to receive marginal\norgans at the unit’s multi-disciplinary liver transplant listing\nmeeting. The majority of participants who decided to participate\ndid so after a long period waiting on the list, with progressive\ndeterioration that was not necessarily reflected by their waiting list\nposition. The feasibility of using livers rescued by NMP for the\nhigh-risk recipient is currently under investigation.\nIn conclusion, this trial demonstrated that NMP provides a\nway of objectively assessing high-risk organs, and allowed\ntransplantation in a significant proportion of currently unutilised\nlivers without any incidence of primary non-function. The use of\nperfusion technology was associated with increased graft utilisa￾tion, considerably extended preservation time and greatly\nimproved transplant logistics. Adoption of functional assessment\nof high-risk livers can increase access to life saving transplanta￾tion and reduce waiting list mortality.\nMethods\nStudy design. This study was a prospective, open label, phase 2 adaptive single￾arm trial comprising high-risk livers meeting two-tier inclusion criteria. The first￾tier was being considered as unsuitable for transplant by all UK transplant centres\nwithin a nationwide fast-track offering scheme. The trial was performed at a single￾institution (Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, UK) with experience in NMP\nand utilisation of high-risk grafts5,31. The second-tier eligibility required at least\none of seven specific criteria that confirmed the high-risk status of every enroled\nliver (Table 4). To minimise risks of high post-transplant complications or mor￾tality for the study participants, the trial used an adaptive design with two interim\nsafety analyses (Supplementary Fig. 1). The study design and conduct complied\nwith all relevant regulations regarding the use of human study participants. The\ntrial was funded by the Wellcome Trust, and granted approval by the National\nResearch Ethics Service in London-Dulwich (REC reference 16/LO/1056, Protocol\nnumber RG 15–240) and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory\nAgency and the University Hospitals Birmingham Research and Development\nDepartment. The project was endorsed by the Research, Innovation and Novel\nTechnologies Advisory Group committee of the National Health Service Blood and\nTransplant. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (reference number\nNCT02740608), the protocol has been published32, and the full version is provided\nin the Supplementary Information.\nDiscarded liver inclusion criteria and the study logistics. The study considered\nall potential donors with a diagnosis of brainstem death or Maastricht category III\nand IV donors after circulatory death, aged up to 85 years, initially retrieved with\nthe intent for transplantation but subsequently declined by all UK transplant\ncentres based on the retrieving or transplant surgeon’s assessment. If our centre\nwas the last in the fast-track offering sequence, the liver had to be deemed\nuntransplantable by two consultant surgeons independently. The surgeons were\npaired together to create an overall low threshold for using marginal livers,\nensuring any liver that could be used without viability testing was transplanted,\nthereby minimising bias. For the liver to be eligible it also had to meet at least one\ndefined high-risk criterion (see Tables 1 and 4). Consent for research was provided\nby the donor’s next of kin.\nStudy participants. Eligible participants were those listed electively for primary\nliver transplantation and deemed to be low-to-moderate transplant risk candidates,\nsuitable to receive a high-risk graft, as assessed by the unit’s transplant waiting list\nmulti-disciplinary team. Candidates were required to have a patent portal vein, no\nsignificant comorbidities (cardiovascular diseases, including active angina, a history\nof ischaemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular events, symp￾tomatic valvular heart disease or cardiac arrhythmias; pulmonary conditions\nincluding pulmonary hypertension or established diagnosis of pulmonary dys￾function), a UK end-stage liver disease18 (UKELD) score ≤62 and no history of\nmajor upper abdominal surgery. Each participant was fully informed of being\noffered a marginal graft and gave written consent for the trial in advance of the\norgan offer, after having at least 24 h to consider their participation.\nThe study intervention and liver viability assessment. All livers were cold￾preserved with University of Wisconsin solution and commenced NMP using the\nOrganOx Metra™ device after arrival at the transplant centre. The protocol stipu￾lated an NMP duration of between 4 and 24 h. Serial perfusate, bile and tissue\nsamples were taken at regular time intervals. For a liver to be considered viable it\nhad to metabolise perfusate lactate to levels ≤2.5 mmol/L within 4 h of commen￾cing the perfusion, in addition to meeting at least 2 of the following additional\ncriteria: evidence of bile production, maintenance of perfusate pH ≥ 7.30, meta￾bolism of glucose, maintenance of stable arterial and portal flows (≥150 and\n≥500 mL/min, respectively), and homogenous perfusion with soft consistency of\nthe parenchyma16.\nIf a liver was considered viable, the transplant was set up and performed. At the\npoint of recipient hepatectomy, the NMP team disconnected the organ from the\ndevice, flushed it with 3 l of histidine–tryptophan–ketoglutarate solution at 4 °C\nand handed it over for immediate implantation. Post-transplant management\nfollowed the unit’s standard protocol, with immunosuppression comprising\ntacrolimus, azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil and low-dose steroids. Each\npatient underwent an MRCP at 6 months unless the investigation was clinically\nindicated earlier.\nLiver quality was determined retrospectively through histological analysis of\nparenchymal biopsies which were assessed for pre-existing liver disease, steatosis,\nglycogen content and features of preservation–reperfusion injury.\n1.00\nKaplan–Meier 1 year graft survival estimates\n0.75\n0.50\n0.25\n0.00\n0\nNumber at risk\nCase–Control = Control 37\nCase–Control = Case\n3\n34 30 27 23\n22 21 20 20\n6\nTime post-transplant (Months)\n9 12\nGraft survival probability\n22\nControls Case\nFig. 5 Comparison of 1-year graft survival estimate.

The co-primary outcomes consisted of (A) feasibility of NMP\nin discarded organ recovery and (B) achievement of successful transplantation. The\nperfused organ recovery rate was the proportion of perfusions leading to trans￾plantation. Successful transplantation was defined as 90-day patient survival—a\nnationally accepted, monitored and continuously audited outcome measure.\nThe key secondary outcome measures included assessment of the liver graft\nfunction (by incidence of primary non-function and early allograft dysfunction33)\nliver function test results, 90-day graft survival, intensive therapy unit and post￾transplant in-hospital stays, incidence of vascular complications, and anastomotic\nand non-anastomotic biliary strictures as assessed by MRCP at 6 months.\nPerioperative data collection included haemodynamic stability, incidence of post￾reperfusion syndrome and blood-product requirements. Post-transplant adverse\nevents and complication severity were graded according to the Clavien–Dindo\nclassification34. The secondary outcomes were compared with contemporary\ncontrols (1:2), matched in order of priority for the donor graft type, UKELD Score,\ndonor age and donor sex only. Four variables included in the original protocol\n(model of end-stage liver disease [MELD], recipient age, BMI and the liver disease\naetiology) were removed as matching criteria due to confounding correlation and\nbeing overly stringent. No recipient suffered from recurrent disease during the\nstudy follow-up period. The matching criteria used identified 39 patients. There\nwas consistency in the recipient selection for high-risk grafts guided by the unit’s\nprotocols and transplant waiting list multi-disciplinary team meetings that assured\nsimilar characteristics regarding the cardiovascular comorbidities and surgical risks\nin the study participants and the matched controls. The pre-planned comparisons\nwith the matched controls group were not powered to demonstrate any differences.\nDue to the small sample sizes, these results should be interpreted with caution; the\ncontrols were included to present the study results within the context of the unit’s\ncontemporary outcomes.\nStatistical analysis. The trial was powered with an emphasis on (A) the feasibility\nof the intervention using NMP and (B) recipient safety. In terms of the intervention\nfeasibility (A), the aim was to achieve an organ recovery rate of at least 50%, with a\nrate of 30% or less being considered unacceptable. Using a two-stage design35, with\nan interim assessment after 24 livers (continuing if ≥8 livers were recovered), a\nsample size of up to 53 livers undergoing NMP might be required, with target alpha\n(one-sided) of 0.05 (actual alpha = 0.047) and target beta of 0.1 (actual\nbeta = 0.098). NMP was considered feasible for organ recovery if at least 22 livers\nwere recovered from 53 perfused. Though the two statistical inferences are asses￾sing different hypotheses (safety and feasibility), they are linked as 22 transplants\nare required for the safety testing of the procedure, which is also the minimum\nnumber required out of 53 perfused livers to be considered feasible.\nFor (B), the mean 90-day patient survival rate for patients receiving liver\ntransplants in the United Kingdom was 93%36. For the discarded livers, the\ndesirable and undesirable 90-day overall survival rates were set at 88% and 73%\n(15% lower), respectively. Using an optimal three-stage adaptive design37 with two\ninterim assessments after 3 patients (requires ≥ 2 successes) and 11 patients\n(≥8 successes), a sample size of 22 patients was required, with alpha (type I error)\nand beta (type II error) of 0.2. As this was an early phase (non-definitive) trial to\nassess the safety of this procedure, a relaxed one-sided alpha was used to attain an\nachievable sample size within the trial duration and cost constraint. The approach\nwas considered successful if there were at least 18 successes out of 22 transplants.\nThe descriptive statistics data were presented as number and percentages, and\nmedian and interquartile range. Due to small numbers, the pre-planned analyses\nused Kruskal–Wallis test to assess differences in continuous variables between two\ngroups and Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. Kaplan–Meier survival\nmethod was used to analyse time-to-event data and conditional logistic regression\nfor matched case–control analysis. All secondary and exploratory analyses were\nTable 4 Study inclusion and criteria.\nGraft inclusion criteria 1.

The trial, called RESCUE, aimed to determine whether machine perfusion can improve the success rate of transplanting these \"extended criteria\" donor livers, which are often discarded due to concerns about their functionality. The study found that machine perfusion allowed for the recovery and maintenance of liver function in previously discarded livers, resulting in a successful transplantation rate of 71% (compared to the standard rate of around 60%) and a low incidence of bile duct injuries. These findings suggest that machine perfusion may offer a promising alternative for expanding the pool of available organs for transplantation, particularly in areas where there is a shortage of donors.

The study included 2 stages: in the first stage, 25 livers were ran￾domised into static cold storage (n = 7), hepatic artery HMP (n = 10), and non-oxygen￾supplemented portal vein HMP (n = 8). In the second stage, 20 livers were randomised into\noxygen-supplemented and non-oxygen-supplemented portal vein HMP (n = 11 and 9,\nrespectively). Changes in dynamic, biochemical, and morphologic parameters during 4-\nhour preservation were compared between perfusion groups, and between potentially trans￾plantable and non-transplantable livers.\nResults\nDuring arterial perfusion, resistance was higher and flow was lower than venous perfusion\n(p = 0.001 and 0.01, respectively); this was associated with higher perfusate markers\nduring arterial perfusion (p>0.05). Supplementary oxygen did not cause a significant alter￾ation in the studied parameters. Morphology was similar between static and dynamic\npreservation groups.

Hepatocellular injury mark￾ers are accessible and easy to perform and could offer insight into graft quality, but large\nrandomised trials are needed to identify reliable quality assessment biomarkers.\nIntroduction\nHypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) has gained interest as a potential means to improve\nthe outcome of marginal livers and allow viability assessment in high-risk grafts [1–5]. Despite\nthis potential of HMP, data on viability biomarkers is inconsistent and none of the investigated\nbiomarkers is able to differentiate between viable and non-viable livers [1, 6, 7].\nAlthough HMP allows for assessment of dynamic perfusion parameters, there is no conclu￾sive evidence that dynamic parameters correlate with graft quality, and the progression of\nthese parameters differs significantly between studies; while recent clinical studies reported\nstable hepatic artery (HA) and portal vein (PV) pressures during HMP [2, 3], others observed\na drop in HA resistance and increased flow during HMP, suggesting relaxation of the arterial\nwalls and improved microcirculation [8–11]. Several perfusate markers have been investigated,\nbut none were able to assess graft viability reliably, and different cut-off values were proposed\nto indicate the severity of reperfusion injury [3, 7, 10]. Histological examination is limited\nto steatosis assessment in clinically suspicious grafts [12–14], but it is not currently used for\nviability assessment due to its invasive nature, limited amount of tissue, and lack of a morpho￾logical standard for viability assessment [1, 7]. In addition, human studies reported controver￾sial results on the morphology of livers preserved with HMP and static cold storage (SCS)\n[2, 15–17]. Finally, the benefits of supplementary oxygen during short-term end ischemic\nhypothermic perfusion have been documented in pre-clinical and clinical studies [4, 5, 18],\nbut the effect of supplementary oxygen on injury markers during human liver HMP is unclear.\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the progression of dynamic, biochemical and histologi￾cal markers during HMP in the human liver, comparing arterial, oxygen-supplemented\nvenous and non-oxygen-supplemented venous perfusion, and to study these markers in rela￾tion to organ quality.\nMaterials and methods\nThis is single-centre, randomised, multi-arm parallel group study.\nParticipants\nEthical approval for the study was obtained from the North London Regional Ethics Commit￾tee 3 (reference no. 10/H0709/70), and confirmed with the National Health Service Blood and\nTransplant (NHSBT) Organ Donor Transplant committee. None of the transplant donors\nwere from a vulnerable population and all donors or next of kin provided written informed\nconsent that was freely given.\nThe study involved 45 sequential livers procured for transplantation by different organ pro￾curement teams across the UK between February 2012 and June 2014. All livers were retrieved\nusing the standard clinical procurement protocols adopted by the UK National Organ\nRetrieval Service (NORS) (http://www.odt.nhs.uk/national-organ-retrieval-service/policies￾and-reports), but were found to be unsuitable for transplantation by UK transplant centres\nEvolution of injury markers in hypothermic machine perfusion\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0203803 September 14, 2018 2 / 12\nprovided support in the form of salary for author\nPD, and also provided support in the form of\nresearch material and advice on using the\nperfusion machine and were involved in\nconceptualization and funding acquisition but did\nnot have any additional role in the study design,\ndata collection and analysis, decision to publish, or\npreparation of the manuscript.

Livers were transported\nfrom the retrieval hospital to our research centre packed in ice and stored in University of Wis￾consin (UW) solution. Only whole livers from deceased donors were used; one split liver was\nexcluded from the study.\nRandomisation\nThe original prototype of the Organ Recovery Workstation1, based on the Lifeport Kidney\nTransporter machine (Organ Recovery Systems, Zaventem, Belgium), did not incorporate an\noxygen delivery system, which was later integrated during the study period. Consequently, an\noxygenated perfusion group could not be randomised at the start of the study, and was added\nduring the second stage of the study. Livers were randomised at 2 stages: stage 1, 25 livers were\nrandomised into static cold storage (SCS, n = 7), arterial perfusion through the hepatic artery\n(AP, n = 10), and non-oxygen-supplemented venous perfusion through the portal vein\n(nOVP, n = 8). Arterial perfusion was studied herein to further assess this perfusion modality\nfollowing an earlier published study by our team [16], which showed equivalence of endothe￾lial preservation using different perfusion routes. In stage 2, 20 livers were randomised into\noxygen-supplemented perfusion (OVP, n = 11) and non-oxygen-supplemented venous perfu￾sion (nOVP, n = 9). The nOVP groups in stages 1 and 2 of the study were similar in character￾istics and perfusion settings. Simple randomisation was performed using a computer￾generated list of random numbers and the allocation sequence was concealed in numbered,\nopaque, and sealed envelopes. Sample size calculation was not performed.\nInterventions\nLivers in the SCS group were submerged in 2 L of KPS-1 and placed in the icebox for 4 hours.\nAlthough KPS-1 is not conventionally used for static preservation, it was used for SCS herein\nto reduce preservation solution variance between groups. Livers in the AP group were cannu￾lated through the HA (Lifeport SealRing™ 10x35 cannula), and livers in the nOVP and OVP\nTable 1.

HMP livers were\nconnected to the non-pulsatile roller pump of the Organ Recovery Workstation, and perfused\nwith 2 L of recirculating KPS-1 through the HA or PV, at 30 mmHg or 7 mmHg, respectively.\nThe preservation period of 4 hours was hypothesised as adequate to observe dynamic and bio￾chemical changes during HMP.\nFor the OVP group, 100% oxygen was administered at a fixed rate of 0.5 L/min using a\nmembrane oxygenator (Dideco Kids D100, Sorin Group Italia, Mirandola, Italy) connected to\nthe perfusion circuit, achieving a perfusate pO2 of 735.1 mmHg (724.1–791.4).\nHypothermia was maintained between 4–8˚ C using a heat exchanger (Polystat temperature\ncontroller, Cole-Parmer UK) and a built-in iced-water container around the perfusion bowl.\nSimilar to clinical studies by Guarrera [2, 3], no metabolic adjustment was undertaken.\nOutcome measures\nDynamic perfusion parameters (flow and vascular resistance) were continuously measured in\nthe HA (AP group) and PV (nOVP and OVP groups) using built-in sensors in the Organ\nRecovery Workstation and recorded hourly. Hepatocellular injury enzymes (alanine transami￾nase, ALT; aspartate transaminase, AST) were measured in the perfusate using Roche P\nModule analyser (Roche Diagnostics Limited, UK), immediately before HMP, then hourly\nafterwards. For morphological assessment, a wedge biopsy was taken from segment 4 and seg￾ment 7 before and after 4-hour preservation (SCS and HMP groups). The rationale for using\nbiopsies from 2 different segments of the liver is based on evidence published elsewhere [19].\nParaffinised, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained liver biopsies were examined under light\nmicroscopy by a liver histopathologist. Assessors of biochemistry and histology samples were\nblinded to the allocation groups. A scoring system previously published by Vekemans et al.\n[17] was used to score morphological changes, based on enlargement of the space of Disse,\nsinusoidal dilatation, coagulation necrosis, congestion, architectural damage, and neutrophil\ninfiltration.\nStatistical analysis\nData was analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Macintosh, Version 20.0. Armonk, NY: IBM\nCorp. Continuous data was presented as median (interquartile range) and categorical data was\npresented in numbers and percentages. Non-parametric tests were used due to small sample\nsize and abnormal distribution. Kruskal-Wallis (KW) and Friedman tests were used to com￾pare differences between and within groups, respectively. When KW test or Friedman test\nshowed a significant difference, a pairwise comparison using Mann-Whitney test or Wilcoxon\ntest was performed. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05.\nResults\nDonor graft characteristics\nCharacteristics of the donor grafts (n = 45) are presented in Table 2. There were no significant\ndifferences in donor graft variables (age, heart-beating status, cold and warm ischaemia times,\nand macrosteatosis) between the groups.\nStage 1 of the study\nDuring the first stage of the study, livers were randomised into 3 groups: SCS (n = 7), AP\n(n = 10), and nOVP (n = 8).\nEvolution of injury markers in hypothermic machine perfusion\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0203803 September 14, 2018 4 / 12\n\nDynamic parameters during HMP.

Resistance in the HA was significantly higher than PV\n(0.83 mmHg/ml/min (0.41–1.11) versus 0.07 mmHg/ml/min (0.05–0.10), p = 0.001), and per￾fusate flow was significantly lower in the HA compared to the PV (33 ml/min (24–48) versus\n92 ml/min (59–127), p = 0.01), Fig 1.\nHepatocellular injury markers during HMP. ALT increased significantly throughout\nperfusion in the AP and nOVP groups (p \u0014 0.001 both groups) and AST levels showed a simi￾lar trend (p = 0.004 and < 0.001 for AP and nOVP groups, respectively). Of note, there was a\nsteep rise in enzyme levels between 0 and 1 hour HMP in both groups. The enzymes were\nhigher in AP group compared to nOVP group, but the difference was not significant (ALT,\np = 0.53; AST, p = 0.50), Fig 2.\nMorphology score in SCS and HMP.

None of the livers in the HA-only perfusion group were potentially transplantable, so a\ncomparison could not be performed. Histology scores in potentially transplantable livers were\nnot significantly different from non- transplantable livers (p = 0.97).\nDiscussion\nDespite the recent expansion in utilisation of HMP to improve the outcome of marginal livers\nin clinical practice, data on viability markers is inconsistent and no markers are yet validated.\nHMP is mostly performed using dual-vessel or PV-only perfusion, and feasibility of both\napproaches has been reported in recent clinical trials [2–4, 11] although the optimal perfusion\nroute is not currently known. Arterial-only perfusion is less commonly used, based on evi￾dence from animal studies showing increased graft injury and heterogeneous perfusion using\nthe HA only [20, 21].\nFig 6. Box whisker plot of parenchymal morphology in oxygen-supplemented and non-oxygen-supplemented\nvenous perfusion. This plot shows the distribution of morphology score values round the median, plotted before and\nafter hypothermic machine perfusion. There was no significant difference in the morphology score between the 2\ngroups (p = 0.10). Top and bottom whiskers represent the maximum and minimum values, respectively, and circles\nrepresent outliers.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0203803.g006\nEvolution of injury markers in hypothermic machine perfusion\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0203803 September 14, 2018 8 / 12\n\nWe found the HA and PV resistance to be similar to those documented in a previous study\nof discarded human livers preserved with dual-vessel perfusion at similar pressures to our\nexperiments [10], which suggests that similar PV flows can be achieved with PV-only perfu￾sion and questions the need for additional HA cannulation and perfusion. In addition, a recent\nstudy in rat, pig and discarded human DCD livers showed complete perfusion of the paren￾chyma and biliary system using hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) using the PV\nonly [22].\nPerfusate flow increased in the first hour of HMP in all perfusion groups and there was a\nsignificant reduction of arterial resistance during the same time period. These changes in per￾fusion dynamics are likely to be due to “opening up” of the microvasculature and relaxation of\narterial walls during HMP, similar to what has been reported previously in porcine [8, 9] and\ndiscarded human livers [10]. In line with other studies [9, 10, 23], we found the resistance to\nbe higher and the flow lower when the graft was perfused via the hepatic artery in comparison\nto the portal vein. This is a reflection of the hepatic circulation in vivo where hepatic arterial\ncirculation is characterised by higher resistance and lower flow than the portal circulation due\nto larger smooth muscle content in the tunica media layer in the arterial walls.\nThe early dynamic changes in our study were associated with a steep rise of hepatocellular\ninjury markers in most liver groups during the first hour of HMP, suggesting an accelerated\nrelease of hepatocellular enzymes into the perfusate due to flushing out of enzymes accumu￾lated in the vascular spaces, similar to observations from a previous porcine liver study [23].\nPerfusate injury markers did not stabilise after the first 1–2 hours of perfusion, but increased\ngradually, possibly due to pre-perfusion ischaemic injury. It is important to keep the different\nrates of enzyme release in mind when collecting perfusate samples, as initial samples might not\nreflect the severity of graft injury. In addition, hepatocellular injury markers were higher in\nsingle-vessel arterial perfusion compared to single-vessel venous perfusion, although the dif￾ference was not statistically significant. These findings suggest that graft perfusion might not\nbe adequate if perfusion is performed using the hepatic artery alone.\nThere was no difference in morphology between biopsies taken from 2 distant liver seg￾ments within each liver, and the architecture was preserved after 4-hour single-vessel perfu￾sion, which agrees with findings from previous studies in discarded human livers [16, 17]. We\ndid not observe significant sinusoidal dilatation or hepatocellular oedema in contrast to other\nresearchers [8, 10, 24]. It is possible that the architectural changes in the latter studies resulted\nfrom prolonged storage (24 hours) or different machine perfusion setup [8, 10]. Based on our\nfindings herein, and from results published previously by our team [16], it seems likely that\narchitectural damage assessment during HMP offers limited information on the quality of\ngrafts, although histological examination remains of importance in evaluating steatosis sever￾ity, degree of fibrosis, and for the assessment of suspicious lesions found during organ\nretrieval.\nWhen potentially transplantable livers were compared to non-tranplantable livers, hepato￾celullar markers in the perfusate were 2 fold higher in the latter group, but the difference was\nnot statsticaly signficant. In another proof-of-concept study, Monbaliu [10] reported that per￾fusae AST distinguished between potentially transplantable and non-transplantable livers, and\nnoted that AST and LDH levels were signficantly higher in non-transplantable livers. Although\nour results match the enzyme levels documented for potentially transplantable livers in the lat￾ter study, they do not show the same level of significant difference, most likely due to the\nmuch higher AST levels observed in non-transplantable livers in Monbaliu study (6–8 fold\nhigher compared to transplantable livers). AST and ALT measured during perfusion were also\nfound to correlate with peak post-transplant levels in the recipient in clinical trials by Guarrera\nEvolution of injury markers in hypothermic machine perfusion\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0203803 September 14, 2018 9 / 12\n\n[2, 3]. Consequently, it seems that perfusate hepatocellular injury markers have the potential\nto be used for graft quality assessment in the human liver.\nSupplementary oxygen did not cause a significant alteration in dynamic, biochemical, or\nmorphological parameters in this cohort, but the need for active oxygenation might only mani￾fest following warm reperfusion; consequently, the effect of oxygenation on metabolism and\nmitochondrial function are better assessed using a normothermic reperfusion model.\nWe report one of the largest studies of discarded human livers, but we acknowledge that the\noverall sample size is relatively small due to the limited number of whole human livers avail￾able for research, which restricted additional groups from being assessed in this study, such as\ndual-vessel perfusion and oxygenated arterial perfusion groups. Due to technical factors\nrelated to oxygen delivery mechanism, the oxygen-supplemented perfusion group could not\nbe randomised at the beginning of the study, but was later added in a second randomisation\nprocess. This resulted in the study being divided into 2 stages, which reduced the size of inter￾vention groups. The study is limited by lack of clinical outcome measures, as the livers were\nnot transplantable; the aim of the study was to describe baseline differences in biomarkers\nusing different perfusion modalities as a proof-of-concept. An additional period of normother￾mic reperfusion would have been useful here, but is not a replacement for transplantation and\nin-situ reperfusion for optimal assessment of organ viability.\nThis study shows that perfusate injury markers have the potential for assessing graft quality\nand that perfusate markers are released at a faster rate during the initial period of perfusion,\nwhich is important if these markers are to be used for graft assessment. It is likely that single￾vessel perfusion via the PV is more beneficial than HA perfusion during HMP on the basis of\nperfusion characteristics and perfusate injury markers. However, additional issues of impor￾tance would be the risk of vessel injury with cannulation, the effect on hepatocyte metabolism\nand bioenergetics including mitochondrial function and the unique importance of maintain￾ing the peri-biliary vascular plexus that is associated with bile duct injury following transplan￾tation. In order to evaluate the optimal perfusion settings and to identify objective markers of\ngraft quality during perfusion, large prospective and randomised clinical trials are needed, as\nthe current knowledge is mainly derived from small size feasibility studies. In addition, bio￾marker standardization and guidelines on outcome definitions are required to enable an unbi￾ased comparison between different studies.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Mr Jahm Persaud from the Biochemistry Department, Royal Free Lon￾don NHS Foundation Trust, London UK for processing biochemistry samples.

The study aimed to determine whether HMP could mitigate the negative effects of ECD livers on post-transplant outcomes by reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. The researchers conducted a prospective observational study involving 45 livers from ECDs, randomly assigned to either static cold storage (SCS) or HMP. They analyzed dynamic and biochemical parameters, including flow, vascular resistance, and enzyme release, as well as histological changes. The results showed that HMP reduced inflammation and oxidative stress markers, such as interleukin-6 and malondialdehyde, respectively. However, HMP did not significantly decrease apoptosis markers, such as caspase-3 and poly ADP ribose polymerase. Furthermore, HMP did not significantly change the histological scores for steatosis, ballooning degeneration, and lobular inflammation. The study suggests that HMP may help preserve ECD livers by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, but more research is required to confirm its effectiveness in reducing apoptosis and improving post-transplant outcomes. Overall, the findings contribute to the ongoing debate about the suitability of ECD livers for transplantation and highlight the need for innovative preservation techniques like HMP."}

Unmet needs for organ\nand tissue preservation place enormous logistical limitations on\n\n\ntransplantation, regenerative medicine, drug discovery, and a\nvariety of rapidly advancing areas spanning biomedicine. A growing\ncoalition of researchers, clinicians, advocacy organizations,\nacademic institutions, and other stakeholders has assembled to\naddress the unmet need for preservation advances, outlining\nremaining challenges and identifying areas of underinvestment and\nuntapped opportunities. Meanwhile, recent discoveries provide\nproofs of principle for breakthroughs in a family of research areas\nsurrounding biopreservation. These developments indicate that a\nnew paradigm, integrating multiple existing preservation\napproaches and new technologies that have flourished in the past\n10 years, could transform preservation research. Capitalizing on\nthese opportunities will require engagement across many research\nareas and stakeholder groups. A coordinated effort is needed to\nexpedite preservation advances that can transform several areas of\nmedicine and medical science.\n Access through your institution\nBuy or subscribe\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nAccess options\n Access through your institution\nAccess Nature and 54 other Nature Portfolio journals\nGet Nature+, our best-value online-access subscription\n$32.99 / 30 days\ncancel any time\nLearn more\nSubscribe to this journal\nReceive 12 print issues and online access\n\n\n$259.00 per year\nonly $21.58 per issue\nLearn more\nBuy this article\n•  Purchase on SpringerLink\n•  Instant access to full article PDF\nBuy now\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during\ncheckout\nAdditional access options:\n•  Log in\n•  Learn about institutional subscriptions\n•  Read our FAQs\n•  Contact customer support\nFigure 1: The true lifesaving potential of organ transplantation.\n[image]\nFigure 2: The global unmet need for transplantation greatly\nexceeds that of the United States (see Fig. 1), which contains\nroughly 4% of the world's population but performs 25% of its\norgan transplants.\n[image]\nFigure 3: 10-year graft survival for each of the six vital organs\ncurrently transplanted (single-organ, deceased donor\ntransplant)49.\n[image]\nFigure 4: An integrated approach to organ and tissue\npreservation would combine multiple preservation conditions\nand temperature ranges, drawing on the strategies found in\nTable 4.\n[image]\n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n[image]\nClinical applications of human organoids\nArticle 03 February 2025\n[image]\nEnduring questions in regenerative biology and the\nsearch for answers\nArticle Open access 09 November 2023\n[image]\nReshaping transplantation with AI, emerging\ntechnologies and xenotransplantation\nArticle 14 July 2025\nReferences\n1.

It explains how machine perfusion allows for longer preservation times, potentially eliminating the need for organ sharing programs and decreasing transportation costs. The article also mentions ongoing efforts to develop normothermic machine perfusion, which could further extend preservation times and potentially eliminate the need for organ shipping altogether. However, the article notes that while machine perfusion holds great promise, it is still in the experimental stage and requires further testing and validation before becoming widely adopted. Nonetheless, the article suggests that machine perfusion has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of organ transplantation by improving efficiency and reducing waste."}

Neumann2\n,\nDaniela Kroy4\n, Anna B. Roehl1\n, Rolf Rossaint1 and Marc Hein1\nAbstract\nBackground: The discrepancy between demand and supply for liver transplants (LT) has led to an increased\ntransplantation of organs from extended criteria donors (ECD).\nMethods: In this single center retrospective analysis of 122 cadaveric LT recipients, we investigated predictors\nof postreperfusion syndrome (PRS) including transplant liver quality categorized by both histological assessment\nof steatosis and subjective visual assessment by the transplanting surgeon using multivariable regression analysis.\nFurthermore, we describe the relevance of PRS during the intraoperative and postoperative course of LT recipients.\nResults: 53.3% (n = 65) of the patients suffered from PRS. Risk factors for PRS were visually assessed organ quality of the\nliver grafts (acceptable: OR 12.2 [95% CI 2.43–61.59], P = 0.002; poor: OR 13.4 [95% CI 1.48–121.1], P = 0.02) as well\nas intraoperative norepinephrine dosage before reperfusion (OR 2.2 [95% CI 1.26–3.86] per 0.1 μg kg− 1 min− 1\n, P = 0.01).\nIn contrast, histological assessment of the graft was not associated with PRS. LT recipients suffering from PRS\nwere hemodynamically more instable after reperfusion compared to recipients not suffering from PRS. They\nhad lower mean arterial pressures until the end of surgery (P < 0.001), received more epinephrine and norepinephrine\nbefore reperfusion (P = 0.02 and P < 0.001, respectively) as well as higher rates of continuous infusion of norepinephrine\n(P < 0.001) and vasopressin (P = 0.02) after reperfusion. Postoperative peak AST was significantly higher (P = 0.001) in LT\nrecipients with PRS. LT recipients with intraoperative PRS had more postoperative adverse cardiac events (P = 0.05) and\nsuffered more often from postoperative delirium (P = 0.04).\nConclusions: Patients receiving ECD liver grafts are especially prone to PRS. Anesthesiologists should keep these newly\ndescribed risk factors in mind when preparing for reperfusion in patients receiving high-risk organs.\nKeywords: Steatosis, Hyponatremia, Cold ischemia time\n* Correspondence: fkork@ukaachen.de 1\nDepartment of Anaesthesiology, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University,\nPauwelsstrasse 30, 52074 Aachen, Germany\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n© The Author(s). 2018 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and\nreproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to\nthe Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

BMC Anesthesiology (2018) 18:29 \nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/s12871-018-0493-9\n\nBackground\nAccording to the Organ Procurement and Transplant￾ation Network of the United States (US) Department of\nHealth and Human Services, the numbers of liver trans￾plantations (LT) in the US have constantly been rising\nsince the beginning of LT [1]: In 2016, a total of 7841\nLTs were performed in the US. By contrast, the numbers\nof LTs in Germany and in the Eurotransplant region\nhave been decreasing since a peak in 2010 [2, 3]. The de￾creasing organ donations combined with the persisting\nhigh morbidity and mortality of patients on the waiting\nlist has led to a discrepancy between organ supply and\ndemand [2, 4] and therefore to the more frequent ac￾ceptance extended criteria donors (ECD) to the pool of\neligible donors [5, 6].\nThe most critical intraoperative moment for the\nanesthesiologist during LT is the reperfusion of the liver\ngraft. An immediate and severe complication following\nreperfusion is hemodynamic instability, the so called post￾reperfusion syndrome (PRS). PRS is defined as a decrease\nof mean arterial pressure (MAP) of more than 30% during\nthe first 5 min after reperfusion and continuing for at least\n1 min [7–12]. PRS occurs in around 10–60% of LT recipi￾ents [8, 9, 13]. Several risk factors for PRS have been de￾scribed: Older donor age, higher donor risk index, longer\ncold ischemic time (CIT), severity of the recipient’s liver\ndisease, operation time and technique, hemodynamics\nat time of reperfusion, and steatosis of the graft organ\n[8, 13–20]. The mechanisms of PRS appear to be com￾plex and not fully understood [10, 21, 22]. In addition,\nthe transplantation of ECD livers has led to a decrease\nin mortality for LT recipients on the wait lists at the\ncost of increased perioperative complication [23]. Both\nthese factors have made it difficult to predict PRS. In\nparticular, the quality of the donor organ and its role as\nrisk factor for the occurrence of PRS as well as its asso￾ciations with patients’ outcome have been neglected in\nthe past.\nMethods\nAim, design and setting of the study\nWe therefore conducted a retrospective analysis of all\nLTs performed at our center. Primary aim of this study\nwas to identify predictors of PRS including transplant\nliver quality assessed by both subjective visual assess￾ment by the transplanting surgeon and histological as￾sessment of steatosis. Secondary aim of this study was to\ndescribe the relevance of PRS during the intraoperative\nand postoperative course of LT recipients.\nPatients and management\nAll patients receiving cadaveric liver transplantation from\nthe beginning of our center’s newly established liver trans￾plantation program in May 2010 until January 1st, 2014\nwere considered eligible for inclusion. Patients were ex￾cluded in case histological donor data or intraoperative\ndata were incomplete or in case of intraoperative severe\nadverse events prior to reperfusion. Liver transplantation\nwas performed using an extracorporeal venovenous/portal\nvenous bypass. Anesthesiological management, bypass\nand surgical procedures, as well as the immune suppres￾sion regimen have already been described by Moosdorf\nand colleagues [24]. Anesthesiologists did not follow a\nspecific coagulation or transfusion management protocol:\nPatient received at maximum 1 Liter of balanced electro￾lyte solution and volume replacement was subsequently\nconducted with FFP in order to anticipate the coagulation\ndisorder. Transfusion triggers for RBCs were tailored to\nthe patient’s comorbidities and provided at the discretion\nof the providing anesthesiologist. Our department’s stand￾ard operating procedure (SOP) for LT includes a TEM\nafter induction, 15–30 and 45–60 min after reperfusion,\nseeking to keep normal coagulation parameters [25].\nData\nDonor data\nThe following data were abstracted from the covering\nletter of the donor organ: donor age, donor body mass\nindex, donor blood sodium concentration, donor alanine\ntransaminase (ALT) blood concentration, donor aspartate\ntransaminase (AST) blood concentration, donor bilirubin\nblood concentration, as well as warm ischemia time (WIT)\nand cold ischemia time (CIT).\nDonor organ assessment\nDonor livers were macroscopically assessed regarding their\nfat content by the implanting surgeon before the recipient\noperation on the preserved cold graft. Organs were cat￾egorized as either good, acceptable or poor, according\nto EuroTransplant criteria. In addition, histological assess￾ment of the donor organ was conducted by the explanting\ncenter (or if missing by the in-house pathology depart￾ment). Organs were categorized in three categories\ndepending on macrovesicular fat content (≥ one intra￾cellular vacuole displacing organelles): Grade 1 – fat\ncontent 0–29%, grade 2 – fat content 30–59%, grade 3 –\nfat content ≥60% [26, 27].\nRecipient data\nThe following data were abstracted from the patient’s\nmedical chart, as recorded at the time of evaluation for\nbeing listed for transplantation: Recipient age, recipient\ndiagnosis leading to transplantation, portal hypertension\n(PoHT; defined by either esophageal varices, thrombopenia\nor splenomegaly), laboratory model of end stage liver\ndisease score (labMELD; 10 x (0,957 x In(serum cre￾atinine) + 0,37 x In(serum creatinine) + 1,12 x In (inter￾national normalized ratio[INR]) + 0,643)) [28], and the\nKork et al.

From the electronic\npatient data management system, concentrations of serum\nbilirubin, serum AST, serum ALT, serum creatinine, inter￾national normalized ratio (INR) as well as renal replace￾ment therapy were abstracted after admission closest to\nthe beginning of surgery (preoperatively), at ICU admis￾sion immediately after surgery (postoperatively) and on\npostoperative day (POD) 1,3,7 and 14.\nThe following data were abstracted from the paper-based\nanesthesia protocol: Heart rate, mean blood pressure (arter￾ial line), boli of norepinephrine and epinephrine at time of\nreperfusion, infusion rate of norepinephrine, infusion rate\nof epinephrine, infusion rate of vasopressin. These values\nwere abstracted at induction of anesthesia, skin incision,\nbeginning of the anhepatic phase, and at 5, 10, 15, 30 and\n60 min after reperfusion as well as at the end of the surgery.\nFurthermore, the number of intraoperatively administered\nred blood cell concentrates (RBCs), platelet concentrates\n(PCs), fresh frozen plasmas (FFPs), the amount of intraop￾eratively administered fibrinogen, prothrombin complex\nconcentrate (PCC), the occurrence of hyperfibrinolysis\n(by thrombelastometry [TEM]), asystole and cerebral\nedema (temporary mydriasis after reperfusion) were ex￾tracted from the anesthesia protocol.\nFrom the patients chart we abstracted the following\ndata from the postoperative period: primary nonfunction\n(PND; re-transplantation or death within 7 days), early\nallograft dysfunction (bilirubin ≥10 mg/dl on post-operative\nday (POD) 7 and/or INR ≥1.6 on POD 7 and/or AST or\nALT > 2000 IU/L within the first 7 days), acute rejec￾tion (clinical diagnosis), surgical revisions, retransplan￾tation, sepsis, need for renal replacement therapy (RRT),\nadverse cardiovascular events (asystole, resuscitation, non\nST elevation myocardial infarction, heart failure), adverse\ncentral nervous events (delirium, intracranial hemorrhage,\nseizures), duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care\nunit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, and death.\nPostreperfusion syndrome\nPRS was defined as fulfillment of at least one of the follow￾ing criteria: (1) Decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP)\nof at least 30% at time of reperfusion, (2) administration of\nan intravenous bolus of norepinephrine > 2 μg kg body\nweight (BW) -1, (3) increase of continuous norepinephrine\ninfusion of ≥0.1 μg kg BW− 1 within 5 to 30 min after reper￾fusion, or (4) initiation of continuous vasopressin infusion\nafter reperfusion. According to our department’s SOP,\nPRS was treated as follows: (i) 0.5 mg atropine before\nreperfusion if heart rate < 80, (ii) NE boli and NE infu￾sion to maintain MAP, (iii) epinephrine boli and infu￾sion in case of significant bradycardia with hypotension\nand decrease of SVO2 during reperfusion, (iv) infusion\nof vasopressin if high doses of NA are necessary or NA\ntherapy ineffective.\nStatistics\nCategorical data with two categories each were tested\nusing Fisher’s exact test, with more than three categories\nwith the Chi squared test with Yates correction. Since\nthe sample size was > 100, central limit theorem applies\nand normal distribution of continuous variables was as￾sumed without testing. Groupwise comparison of continu￾ous variables were therefore conducted using the t-test for\nindependent samples. Changes of continuous variables over\ntime were compared using a repeated measures ANOVA\ntest. If a time/variable-interaction was detected by the\nANOVA, a post-hoc t-test was conducted for each time\npoint. Survival analysis were conducted plotting Kaplan￾Meier curves and these were compared using the Log\nRank test. Agreement between visual organ assessment by\nthe surgeon and histopathological steatosis grading was\nquantified by calculating an unweighted Cohen’s kappa.\nBinary logistic regression analysis was used to determine\nindependent factors predicting postreperfusion syndrome.\nVariables reaching a level of significance (P ≤ 0.05) when\nunivariably tested, were introduced into the multivariable\nlogistic regression model. Statistical analyses were con￾ducted using IBM SPSS 22, figures were created using\nGraphPad Prism 6.0. A two-sided p-value ≤0.05 was con￾sidered statistically significant.\nResults\nPatients\nA total of 172 patients received a liver transplantation\nduring the study period. 50 patients were excluded due\nto incomplete histological data (n = 46), incomplete intra￾operative documentation (n = 3) or due to severe adverse\nevents prior to reperfusion (n = 1; need for cardiopulmo￾nary bypass due to laceration of the inferior caval vein). A\ntotal of 122 patients were analyzed (Fig. 1).\nClinical characteristics of the study population are\ndepicted in Table 1. Recipients of LT had a mean age of\n55 (54.9 ± 9.8) and a mean labMELD of 20 (19.8 ± 10.3).\nThe most frequent reason for transplantation was cir￾rhosis (57 of 122; 46.7%) followed by tumor (25 of 122;\n20.5%). Organ donors had a mean age of 55 (55.2 ± 16.2),\nwere 46.7% female, had a mean BMI of 29 (28.8 ± 7.2),\nand serum sodium, ALT, AST, bilirubin within the refer￾ence range. The mean CIT of the donor organs was 8 h\n(8.3 ± 2.3), mean WIT was 44 min (43.7 ± 7.5).\nPostreperfusion syndrome\nOf the 122 liver transplant recipients, 65 (53.3%) devel￾oped PRS (Table 1). Patients developing PRS received an\norgan more often due to acute liver failure (10 of 65 vs.\n2 of 57, 15.4% vs. 3.5%, P = 0.03) and less often due to\ncirrhosis (20 of 65 vs. 37 of 57, 30.8% vs. 64.9%, P <\n0.001) compared to recipients not developing PRS and\nsuffered more often from PoHT (52 of 65 vs. 33 of 57,\nKork et al. BMC Anesthesiology (2018) 18:29 Page 3 of 11\n\n80.0% vs. 57.9%, P = 0.01). Organ donors for recipients\ndeveloping PRS had a higher BMI (31.1 ± 8.2 vs. 26.4 ±\n4.8, P < 0.001) and a higher serum sodium concentration\n(149.1 ± 7.8 vs. 146.1 ± 8.4, p = 0.04) compared to organ\ndonors for recipients not developing PRS. Donor organs\nfor patients who developed PRS had longer mean CITs\n(8.7 ± 2.3 vs. 7.8 ± 2.3 h, p = 0.04) and more often had an\nextreme CIT of ≥10 h (17 of 65 vs. 6 of 57, 26.2% vs.\n10.5%, p = 0.02).\nPredictors of postreperfusion syndrome\nIn order to identify predictors of PRS we conducted a\nbinary logistic regression analysis with PRS as dependent\nvariable introducing known risk factors for PRS in the\nmodel (Table 2). Only visually assessed acceptable (OR\n12.2 [95% CI 2.43–61.59], P = 0.002) or poor (OR 13.4\n[95% CI 1.48–121.1], P = 0.02) quality of the donor\norgan and norepinephrine dosage before reperfusion\n(OR 2.2 [95% CI 1.26–3.86] per 0.1 μg kg− 1 min− 1\n, P =\n0.01) predicted the occurrence of PRS. Interestingly, the\nhistological assessment of donor organ’s steatosis was\nnot a good predictor for PRS. This was not due to collin￾earity of the variables: the visual and histological assess￾ment differed significantly (p < 0.001) and agreed poorly\n(cohen’s kappa 0.31, Table 3). For example, 21 of 122\ndonor organs were staged as acceptable or poor by visual\ninspection but classified as stage 1 steatosis by histo￾logical assessment.\nPostreperfusion syndrome and the intraoperative course\nafter reperfusion\nLT recipients with PRS were hemodynamically more un￾stable after reperfusion until the end of surgery compared\nto patients without PRS (Fig. 2): Recipients with PRS had\nlower MAPs after reperfusion (P < 0.001; Fig. 2a) and\naccordingly received higher infusion of continuous\nnorepinephrine (P < 0.001, Fig. 2b) and vasopressin (P <\n0.001; Fig. 2c) compared to patients without PRS. Heart\nrate and continuous epinephrine infusion after reperfu￾sion did not differ in LT recipients with and without\nPRS (Fig. 2d and e). At the time of reperfusion of the\nliver transplant, recipients with PRS received higher boli\nof norepinephrine (1.5 ± 1.6 vs. 0.3 ± 0.4 μg kg− 1\n, P = <\n0.001) and epinephrine (0.3 ± 0.5 vs. 0.1 ± 0.2 μg kg− 1\n; P =\n0.01; Fig. 2f).\nFurthermore, LT recipients with PRS received more\nextensive hemotherapy intraoperatively: Compared to\npatients without PRS, LT recipients with PRS received\nmore platelet concentrates (1.6 ± 1.8 vs. 1.1 ± 1.5 units;\nP = 0.04; more fibrinogen (3.0 ± 3.2 vs. 1.7 ± 1.2 g; P =\n0.01) and more PCC (1313 ± 1610 vs. 579 ± 1133 IU; P =\n0.01; Table 4). There was no significant difference in the\namount of RBC and FFP administered as well as in other\nintraoperative postreperfusion adverse events (Table 4).\nPostreperfusion syndrome and the postoperative course\nafter transplantation\nLT recipients with PRS demonstrated a more severe organ\ndamage after transplantation: During the first three postop￾erative days, AST was higher in patients with PRS (P = 0.02;\nFig. 3a), as was ALT, but without statistical significance\n(P = 0.40; Fig. 3b). LT recipients with and without PRS\ndid not differ in bile retention, as postoperative serum\nbilirubin concentrations were similar (Fig. 3c). Recipients\nwith PRS postoperatively had poorer organ function as\nhemostasis was poorer compared to recipients without\nPRS (P = 0.01; Fig. 3d). The inflammation marker procalci￾tonin as well as the kidney function marker serum creatin￾ine did not differ in LT recipients with and without\nPRS (Fig. 3e and f).\nRegarding postoperative adverse events, LT recipients\nwith PRS suffered more often from postoperative delirium\nFig. 1 Patients. Flow chart of patient inclusion. PRS: postreperfusion syndrome\nKork et al. BMC Anesthesiology (2018) 18:29 Page 4 of 11\n\n(8/65 vs. 1/57, 12.3% vs. 1.8%; P = 0.04) and major cardio￾vascular events (11/65 vs. 3/57, 16.9% vs. 5.3%; P = 0.05;\nTable 5). LT recipients with PRS also tended to have a lon￾ger ICU LOS (11.7 ± 17.0 vs. 9.7 ± 15.7; P = 0.09; Table 5).\nA Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for LT recipient survival\n(Fig. 4a) and graft survival (Fig. 4b) did not show signifi￾cant differences.\nDiscussion\nIn this single center retrospective analysis of 122 LT recip￾ients, we found that approximately half of the patients suf￾fered from PRS (53.3%). Multivariable regression analysis\nidentified two predictors of PRS: Only visually assessed ac￾ceptable (OR 12.2, P = 0.002) and poor (OR 13.4, P = 0.02)\ndonor organ quality by the transplanting surgeon and\nintraoperative norepinephrine infusion rate before reperfu￾sion of the liver transplant (OR 2.2 per 0.1 μg/kg/min, p =\n0.01) were associated with the occurrence of PRS. LT\nrecipients suffering from PRS were hemodynamically\nmore instable after reperfusion compared to recipients\nnot suffering from PRS. They had lower MAPs from re￾perfusion until the end of surgery (P < 0.001). Hence,\nthey received more epinephrine and norepinephrine\nbefore reperfusion (P < 0.001 and P = 0.01, respectively)\nand higher rates of continuous infusion of norepineph￾rine (P < 0.001) and vasopressin (P = 0.02) after reperfu￾sion of the transplant. Moreover, LT recipients with\nintraoperative PRS had a more complicated postopera￾tive course compared to recipients without intraopera￾tive PRS: They had more adverse cardiac events (P =\nTable 1 Clinical characteristics. of liver organ donors (top) and liver transplant recipients (bottom) of 122 single center liver transplantations\n(LTs)\nAll LTs (n = 122) PRS (n = 65) no PRS (n = 57) P\nDonor characteristics\nAge [years] 55.2 ± 16.2 57.1 ± 15.1 53.1 ± 17.2 0.18\nSex [female] 57 (46.7%) 32 (49.2%) 24 (42.1%) 0.42\nBMI [kg/cm2\n] 28.8 ± 7.2 31.1 ± 8.2 26.4 ± 4.8 < 0.001\nSodium [mmol/L] 147.7 ± 8.2 149.1 ± 7.8 146.1 ± 8.4 0.04\nALT [U/L] 114.2 ± 289.6 106.7 ± 223.2 122.8 ± 352.4 0.77\nAST [U/L] 124.4 ± 237.8 115.9 ± 182.1 134.1 ± 290.0 0.69\nBilirubine [mg/dL] 0.86 ± 1.23 0.80 ± 1.33 0.93 ± 1.13 0.59\nCold ischemic time [h] 8.3 ± 2.3 8.7 ± 2.3 7.8 ± 2.3 0.04\n≥ 10 h [n] 23 (18.9%) 17 (26.2%) 6 (10.5%) 0.02\nWarm ischemic time [min] 43.7 ± 7.5 44.9 ± 6.7 42.3 ± 8.2 0.06\nRecipient characteristics\nAge [years] 54.9 ± 9.8 55.2 ± 9.8 54.5 ± 9.8 0.69\nSex [female] 43 (35.2%) 21 (32.3%) 22 (38.6%) 0.57\nBMI [kg/cm2\n] 27.6 ± 5.3 27.3 ± 5.5 28.1 ± 5.0 0.41\nDiagnosis [n]\nacute liver failure 12 (9.8%) 10 (15.4%) 2 (3.5%) 0.03\nacute on chronic 5 (4.1%) 1 (1.5%) 4 (7.0%) 0.18\ncirrhosis 57 (46.7%) 20 (30.8%) 37 (64.9%) < 0.001\ntumor 25 (20.5%) 14 (21.5%) 11 (19.3%) 0.82\ngraft failure 7 (5.7%) 2 (3.1%) 5 (8.8%) 0.25\nothers (PSC, polycystic) 16 (13.1%) 10 (15.4%) 6 (10.5%) 0.59\nportal hypertension 85 (69.7%) 52 (80.0%) 33 (57.9%) 0.01\nlabMELD 19.8 ± 10.3 20.0 ± 9.9 19.6 ± 10.8 0.82\nCreatinine preop [mg/dl] 1.71 ± 1.49 1.75 ± 0.23 1.66 ± 0.15 0.14\npreoperative RRT [n] 15 (12.3%) 8 (12.3%) 7 (12.3%) 1.00\nLT Liver transplantation, PRS postreperfusion syndrome, BMI body mass index, ALT Alanine transferase, AST Aspartat transferase, labMELD laboratory Model of end￾stage liver disease score, RRT renal replacement therapy\nClinical characteristics of liver organ donors (top) and liver transplant recipients (bottom) of 122 single center LTs.

No changes in operating\ntechnique or anesthesiologic management were made\nduring the study period, leading to a homogenous single\ncenter study sample. Nevertheless, this study has several\nweaknesses. Due to the retrospective design of the analyses,\ndata quality could be impaired. Histological data for our\nanalyses was limited to steatosis assessment. Analyses of\nhemodynamics from hand-written anesthesia protocols are\noften suspected to present “sugar-coated” hemodynamic\nvalues. Although we cannot rule out that this was the\ncase, our data present clinically and empirically plausible\nhemodynamics. At worst, hemodynamic stability is overes￾timated and the effects shown are even more pronounced.\nThe fact that this was a single center analysis combined\nwith the uncommon but consistent use of intraoperative\nvenovenous/portalvenous bypass limits the external validity\nof our results.\nAlthough rather on the top end of the range, PRS inci￾dence of 53% in our sample concurs with several other\nstudies [8, 10, 12, 17, 19]. The pathophysiology of PRS is\ncomplex and not entirely understood. The abrupt influx\nof cold, hyperkalemic and acidic blood into the circula￾tion, air or thrombotic embolization and the release of\nvasoactive substances from the graft liver contribute to\nPRS [29–31]. The rationale for using a venovenous/por￾talvenous bypass during the anhepatic phase at our cen￾ter is to ensure maximum safety of the procedure [24].\nThe combination of a femoro-brachial and porto-axillary\nTable 2 Predictors of PRS\nunivariable multivariable\nWald OR 95% CI P Wald OR 95% CI P\nDonor related\nAge [years] 1.79 1.02 0.99–1.04 0.18\nSodium [mmol/L] 3.92 1.05 1.00–1.10 0.048 3.74 1.06 1.0–1.13 0.053\nALT [U/L] 0.94 1.00 0.99–1.00 0.76\nAST [U/L] 0.17 1.00 0.99–1.00 0.68\nBilirubine [mg/dL] 0.28 0.92 0.68–1.24 0.60\nCIT [h] 4.09 1.19 1.05–1.41 0.04 1.62 1.14 0.93–1.38 0.20\nWIT [min] 3.54 1.05 0.99–1.11 0.06\nvisual assessment by surgeona\nacceptable 11.03 13.14 2.87–60.03 0.001 9.21 12.23 2.43–61.59 0.002\npoor 6.27 14.6 1.79–118.9 0.01 5.34 13.40 1.48–121.1 0.02\nsteatosis (histological)b\nstage 2 0.36 1.58 0.36–6.93 0.55\nstage 3 1.38 3.79 0.41–34.97 0.42\nRecepient related\nlabMELD 0.05 1.00 0.97–1.04 0.82\nPoHT 6.78 2.91 1.30–6.50 < 0.01 2.15 2.07 0.78–5.48 0.14\nNE dosage before reperfusion [0.1 μg kg−1 min−1\n] 7.86 2.00 1.23–3.24 0.01 7.56 2.20 1.26–3.86 0.01\nALT alanine transferase, AST aspartate transferase, CIT cold ischemia time, WIT warm ischemia time, labMELD laboratory Model of end-stage liver disease score,\nPoHT portal hypertension, NE norepinephrine, OR odds ratio, CI confidence interval a\ncompared to visual assessment category “good”; b\ncompared to stage 1\nResults of univariable (left) and multivariable (right) binary logistic regression analyses in 122 cases of LT to predict PRS.

Nevertheless, the use of a bypass during LT\nsurgery remains controversial [13, 32, 33]. The PRS effect\nseen in our study is therefore likely to be predominantly\ncaused by vasoactive substances released from the graft.\nWith that in mind, PRS incidence does appear rather high.\nA possible explanation for this contradiction may be\nthe fact that we used an extended definition for PRS.\nPRS is commonly defined as a decrease in MAP of more\nthan 30% from the baseline value for more than one minute\nduring the first five minutes after reperfusion [7, 8, 10–12].\nWe extended the definition for PRS for mainly two reasons.\nFirst, the treatment of PRS seeks to preserve hemodynamic\nstability. At the time of reperfusion, anesthesiologists\nexpect a certain degree of hemodynamic instability and pre￾emptively treat a (soon to be) falling MAP with catechol￾amines [11], either as bolus or by increasing continuous\ninfusion of the very same. Since this preemptive treatment\nconceals the occurrence of by-definition-PRS, we added (i)\nthe administration of an intravenous bolus of norepineph￾rine > 2 μg kg (BW) -1 as well as (ii) the increase of continu￾ous norepinephrine infusion of ≥0.1 μg kg BW− 1 within\nthe first 5 min after reperfusion as new criteria to the defin￾ition. Second, our clinical empiricism and the literature\nhave presented cases of prolonged vasodilation after re￾perfusion [34–36]. We thus included (iii) an increase of\ncontinuous norepinephrine infusion up to 30 min after\nreperfusion and (iv) the initiation of continuous vasopressin\nFig. 2 Hemodynamics.

However, our data ap￾pear clinically plausible and concur with description of\nhemodynamic recovery after PRS by other authors [17].\nIn this study, multivariable regression modelling identi￾fied one donor related and one recipient related predictor\nof PRS: graft quality – visually assessed by the transplanting\nsurgeon – and cumulative intraoperative norepinephrine\ndosage before reperfusion of the liver graft. The variety of\nrisk factors and risk prediction models described in differ￾ent studies suggests that PRS may occur in an unpredict￾able manner or may be highly subjective to center-specific\neffects [8, 13–20, 22]. The most frequent reported risk fac￾tors for PRS are longer CIT [15, 16, 18, 20] and intraopera￾tive hemodynamics prior to reperfusion [14, 15, 17, 20],\nfollowed by graft steatosis [8, 16], operation time and tech￾nique [15, 18], severity of recipient’s liver disease [8, 19],\nand donor age [13, 17]. One single center study retrospect￾ive analysis was unable to identify even a single risk factor\nin a retrospective analysis of a sample of 261 LT\nrecipients [37]. Our findings that graft quality and hemo￾dymic impairment prior to reperfusion are risk factors for\nPRS concur with several similar studies. However, it re￾mains cryptic why the multitude of these observational\nstudies generate such a diversity of findings when it comes\nto predicting postreperfusion syndrome. Prospective multi￾center trials, the creation of an LT register or meta-analyses\ninvestigating the prediction of PRS could help to shed light\non this matter in the future.\nThe increasing number of liver transplantations has led\nto an increased demand of donor organs [1] and to the\ngrowing use of organs from extended criteria donors (ECD)\n[23]. A common quality marker for organs is fatty change,\nor steatosis. Steatosis has indeed been linked to the occur￾rence of PRS [8, 16]. Studies have shown that transplant￾ation of liver grafts with moderate to severe steatosis can\nvery well be conducted without sacrificing recipient survival\nbut in particular, that increased efforts are needed when\ndealing with these organs [26, 38]. However, macroscopic\nassessment of the organ may not be qualified to assess\nsteatosis: Rey and colleagues have examined 36 livers of\norgan donors which were explanted but not allocated.\nFig. 3 Clinical chemistry. Postoperative clinical chemistry of 122 liver transplant (LT) recipients, 65 with postreperfusion syndrome (PRS, black\ncircles), 57 without postoperative PRS (white circles). LT recipients with PRS suffered from greater postoperative transplant damage and poorer\ntransplant function during the postoperative course: Aspartat transferase blood concentration was higher (a) and blood hemostasis was poorer\n(d) compared to LT recipients without postreperfusion syndrome (alanine transferase was higher but did not reach significance, (b) LT recipients\nwith and without PRS did not differ in gall retention (c). Inflammation marker procalcitonin (e) and kidney function marker creatinine (f) were\npeaking higher during the postoperative course in LT recipients with PRS compared to recipients without PRS but did not reach statistical\nsignificance. P-values: repeated measures ANOVA; *: post-hoc t-test; mean and standard deviation\nKork et al. BMC Anesthesiology (2018) 18:29 Page 8 of 11\n\nThe authors found that macroscopic appearance and col￾oring compared to histopathologic evaluation for steatosis\nunveiled discrepancies: Most of the graft livers with histo￾pathologically confirmed mild degree of steatosis macro￾scopically appeared yellow, thus of false poor quality and\ncould have been transplanted. In our analyses, micro￾scopic steatosis evaluation was a worse predictor for PRS\nthan the visual evaluation of the transplanting surgeon.\nThis may be the case because surgeons likely assess the\norgan not only by its color, but also by general appearance,\norgan consistency, and size. It may even be the case that\ninformation of the recipient’s medical history and the\nknowledge that the organ was already rejected once by an￾other center or had a long CIT additionally influenced the\nassessment. Therefore, the multitude of information may\nhave enabled the surgeon to predict PRS better than any\nsingle variable (recipient status, CIT, steatosis, etc.).\nWe also found intraoperative norepinephrine infusion rate\nbefore reperfusion to be a predictor of PRS. This also con￾curs with other studies that have identified markers of\nhemodynamic instability prior to reperfusion as predictors\nof PRS. One possible explanation for norepinephrine infu￾sion or hemodynamic instability is hypovolemia. This would\nalso concur with other studies that have shown lower central\nvenous pressure at time of dissection [14] or at time of re￾perfusion [17] as well as a higher requirement for transfu￾sion units [15] to be predictors of PRS. A second possible\nexplanation is vasodilatation or vasplegia which has been\nlinked to end stage liver disease [39, 40]. Case reports have\ndescribed vasoplegic syndrome to occur during liver trans￾plantation [31, 41]. However, differentiation between the\ntwo can sometimes be complicated as both appear alike\n[34]. A third possible explanation may be that these patients\nalready had a compromised cardiac function. E.g., Xu and\ncolleagues could link left ventricular diastolic dysfunction to\nthe occurrence of PRS in a cohort of 330 Chinese LT recipi￾ents [20]. Unfortunately, our data did not contain systematic\nand detailed cardiac function assessment of the recipients\nand the literature lacks systematic investigation of its impact\non the occurrence of PRS. Moreover, it has been suggested\nby several authors that PRS could be only a sign of an\nunderlying problem. It could be that anhepatic hypovolemia,\nvasoplegia and/or impaired cardiac function demask as PRS\nintraoperatively. On top of it, patients receiving a LT\nfrom ECD appear especially susceptible to severe PRS.\nFig. 4 Survival.

In par￾ticular, the impact of PRS on hard clinical endpoints\nsuch as primary graft nonfunction with requirement for\nretransplantation and mortality is unresolved. E.g., some\nstudies show an effect of PRS on mortality [15, 18–20]\nand others did not [13, 17]. In fact, we were not able to\nshow a significant association of PRS with primary non￾function (4.6 vs. 1.8%) and mortality (15.4% vs. 12.3%) in\nthis study population. This is most likely due to the\nsmall sample size, again underscoring the need for mul￾ticenter registries. Regarding post-transplantation mor￾bidity, we could demonstrate in our sample that the\noccurrence of PRS was associated with a higher fre￾quency of postoperative delirium (12.3% vs. 1.8%) and\nmajor cardiovascular events (16.9% vs. 5.3%). While\nother studies have demonstrated early allograft dysfunc￾tion [42, 43], ICU length of stay [43] and the need for\npostoperative renal dysfunction [19, 20] we could not\nsubstantiate these associations in our study sample.\nConclusions\nThe data of this study demonstrated that both the visual\nassessment of the liver graft by the transplanting surgeon\nas well as the intraoperative recipients need for catechol￾amines before reperfusion of the graft were predictors for\nPRS at our center. Besides the known risk factors for PRS,\nanesthesiologists should keep these newly described\nrisk factors in mind when preparing for reperfusion.\nAs the impact of PRS on short- and long-term hard\nclinical endpoint remains inconclusive, further investi￾gations and possibly multicenter prospective registries\ncould ultimately resolve the impact of PRS on LT re￾cipients’ outcome.\nAbbreviations\nALT: Alanine transferase; AST: Aspartat transferase; CIT: Cold ischemia time;\nECD: Extended criteria donors; FFP: Fresh frozen plasma; INR: International\nnormalized ratio; labMELD: Laboratory Model of end stage liver disease;\nLT: Liver transplantation; MAP: Mean arterial pressure; MELD: Model of end\nstage liver disease; min: Minute(s); NE: Norepinephrine; OR: Odds ratio;\nPC: Platelet concentrate; PCC: Prothrombin complex concentrate;\nPOD: Postoperative day; PoHT: Portal hypertension; PRS: Postreperfusion\nsyndrome; PSC: Primary biliary cirrhosis; RBC: Red blood cell concentrate;\nSOP: Standard operating procedure; TEM: Thrombelastometry; US: United\nStates; WIT: Warm ischemia time\nAcknowledgements\nThis analysis was conducted in the course of the doctoral thesis of AR at the\nMedical Faculty of the RWTH Aachen, Germany.\nFunding\nThe study did not receive external funding and was conducted on\ndepartmental funds only.\nAvailability of data and materials\nThe datasets generated and/or analysed during the current study are not\npublicly available due German Data Protection Laws but are available from\nthe corresponding author on reasonable request after approval of the local\nethics committee and data safety board.\nAuthors’ contributions\nAR, AA, MH designed the research, AR participated in acquisition of the data,\nFK, AR, MH conducted data analysis.

The study included 122 liver transplant recipients, of whom 65 developed PRS. The results showed that highly steatotic livers were associated with a higher incidence of PRS, as well as greater hemodynamic instability during reperfusion. However, there was no difference in overall survival between those who received highly steatotic livers and those who did not. The authors suggest that further studies are needed to determine whether the use of highly steatotic livers should be restricted based solely on the presence of PRS. The study also found that visual assessment of liver steatosis by the surgeon was less reliable than histopathological grading. Overall, the study highlights the importance of careful selection of highly steatotic livers for transplantation and the need for ongoing monitoring and management of PRS."}

Organ\nshortage is not only due to an inadequate number of available\norgans, but also the inability to adequately assess and evaluate\nthese organs prior to transplantation. Over the last few\ndecades, ex-vivo perfusion of the liver has emerged as a\nuseful technique for both improved organ preservation and\nassessment of organs prior to transplantation. Large animal\nstudies have shown the superiority of ex-vivo perfusion over\ncold static storage. However, these studies have not, necessa￾rily, been translatable to human livers. Small animal studies\nhave been essential in understanding and improving this tech￾nology. Similarly, these results have yet to be translated into\nclinical use. A few Phase 1 clinical trials have shown promise\nand confirmed the viability of this technology. However, more\nrobust studies are needed before ex-vivo liver perfusion can be\nwidely accepted as the new clinical standard of organ preser￾vation. Here, we aimed to review all relevant large and small\nanimal research, as well as human liver studies on normother￾mic ex-vivo perfusion, and to identify areas of deficiency and\nopportunities for future research endeavors.\nCitation of this article: Akateh C, Beal EW, Whitson BA, Black\nSM.

J Clin Transl Hepatol\n2018;6(3):276–282. doi: 10.14218/JCTH.2017.00048.\nIntroduction\nDespite significant improvements in graft and patient survival\nrates, there is still a large discrepancy between the available\norgans for transplant and the number of candidates on the\nwaiting list for transplant. In the United States, in 2016, there\nwere 14,432 patients listed for liver transplantation and 7,841\nliver transplants preformed, leaving 6,591 patients without\navailable organs for transplantation.1 Unfortunately, the\nnumber of deceased organ donors appears to have reached\na plateau.1–4 As such, over the past three decades, many\ncenters have pursued several different methods to increase\nthe available donor pool for transplantation.\nOne such area involves increasing the use of marginal\ndonor organs. While most donor organs can generally tolerate\nvariable durations of static cold storage (SCS), and its asso￾ciated ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), marginal organs have\nbeen known to do poorly under such circumstances.5–7 This\nhas led to renewed interest in techniques that would improve\nthe quality of donor organ preservation and, thus, improve the\nsuitability of marginal donor organs for transplantation. The\nconcept of machine perfusion was introduced by Alexis Carrel\nand Charles Lindberg in 1935, in their work “The Culture of\nOrgans”,\n8 and later expanded upon by Belzer,9 who also was\na pioneer in hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP).\nHypothermic ex-vivo perfusion of the kidney produced\nimpressive results and resulted in increases in the number\nof organs available for transplantation. Similar advances\nhave not translated to liver transplantation, however, where\nSCS remains the prominent preservation modality outside of\nclinical trials. Unlike kidneys, livers have a much higher met￾abolic activity and tolerate prolonged ischemia poorly. With\ntheir high metabolic demand, donor livers have been more\nchallenging to perfuse and sustain under normothermic con￾ditions. Research into normothermic ex-vivo perfusion has\ncontinued over the last five decades. With advancements in\nthe perfusion technology and the understanding of organ\nphysiology, it has seen renewed interest as a platform to pre￾serve, assess and potentially repair marginal donor organs.10\nThere are a number of devices currently in clinical use for\nthis procedure, including the Organ Assist’s Liver Assist (with\nan adjustable temperature range from 108\n–388 C; for per￾formance of hypothermic and normothermic perfusion),11 the\nOrganOx Metra (normothermic perfusion)12 and the Trans￾medics OCSTM Liver Portable Perfusion System (normother￾mic perfusion).13 Overall, these systems consist of a hepatic\nartery +/− portal vein pump, a perfusate reservoir and an\noxygenating chamber of oxygenated perfusion (Fig. 1).\nAlthough there is ongoing debate over the best preserva￾tion/perfusion temperature, normothermic (liver) machine\nperfusion (NMP or normothermic machine liver perfusion)\nappears to be gaining more traction and acceptance, compared\nto subnormothermic perfusion and hypothermic machine\nperfusion (HMP). It is, thus, likely to become the standard of\nex-vivo machine perfusion. Regardless of approach, it has\n276 Journal of Clinical and Translational Hepatology 2018 vol. 6 | 276–282\nCopyright: © 2018 Authors.

We sought to\nreview the progress made in NMP, as well as to explore oppor￾tunities for future research.\nPre-clinical studies\nLarge animal ex-vivo liver perfusion studies\nEarly in the history of liver transplantation, the impact of graft\nischemia on outcomes had become evident. In a first attempt at\nmachine perfusion of the liver, Slapak et al.14 adapted the\nDebakey roller pump used in cardiac surgery into an apparatus\nfor in-situ liver perfusion of the donor organ for transplantation.\nThese initial perfusions lasted for about 8 h, and were done\nunder hypothermic conditions, given the success of hypothermic\nmachine perfusion of the kidney.14,15 The development of the\nUniversity of Wisconsin (UW) solution and its success in organ\nSCS, led to temporary abandonment of machine perfusion.\nDespite the successes of the UW solution in cold storage,\nhowever, there was growing concern that SCS was not the\nideal preservation method for liver grafts. Although, normo￾thermic (regional) perfusion had been introduced by Otto\net al.16 in 1958, and later by Liem et al.17 as a treatment\nalternative for acute liver failure, normothermic ex-vivo per￾fusion did not enter the experimental scene until much later.\nThe discovery and success of cyclosporine resulted in a sig￾nificant increase in the number of organs being transplanted.\nWith this success, however, came the issue of organ shortage.\nWhile most ideal livers tolerated SCS well, marginal livers\ndid not. Unfortunately, there was no good way to assess the\norgan quality prior to transplantation. As such, there was\nrenewed interest in ex-vivo perfusion as a modality for organ\nevaluation and preservation. One of the earliest experiments in\nnormothermic ex-vivo liver perfusion was performed by Ikeda\net al.18 in 1990, in which six porcine livers previously stored for\n24 hours at 48\nC with the UW solution underwent 3 h of sangui￾neous perfusion either at 328\nC or 378\nC. These organs were\ncompared to six other porcine livers perfused at 378\nC immedi￾ately following procurement. The latter group had better portal\nand hepatic artery pressures as well as bile production com￾pared to both groups that underwent 24 h of cold storage.18\nExperiments on liver perfusion have equally been driven by\nthe desire to optimize donation after cardiac death (DCD) livers\nprior to transplantation. In 2001, Schön et al.19 used a DCD\nporcine model to demonstrate successful preservation and\ntransplantation of porcine livers. The organs were subjected\nto 1 h of warm ischemia time, followed by 4 h of NMP. While\nnone of the recipients of the six livers subjected to 4 h of SCS\nsurvived for more than 7 days, all six recipients of livers from\nthe NMP group survived.19 About the same time, other inves￾tigators showed that NMP could be extended to 72 h, and was\nassociated with better histological preservation, less transami￾nase release, improved bile production and superior synthetic/\nmetabolic function.20–24\nMore recent experiments have, again, demonstrated\nimprovement in hemodynamics of the organ, reduction in\nmarkers of ischemia, better avoidance of ischemic and hypo￾thermic injury (Ishak score) and better maintenance of hep￾atocyte viability in livers preserved by NMP.25–27 In an attempt\nto investigate the benefits of NMP on Maastricht Category 2\nDCD donors, Fondevilla et al.28 used a DCD porcine model for\nwhich the donor pigs had undergone 90-m cardiac arrest, after\nwhich they were divided into three groups. The first group was\npreserved by SCS, the second and third groups underwent\n60 m of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) perfu￾sion before being preserved by SCS or NMP for 4 h respectively.\nThe investigators reported a 0% survival in the SCS group,\n83% survival in the ECMO+SCS group and 100% survival in\nthe ECMO+NMP group. Liver function, endothelial injury, cyto￾kine and inflammatory response, and tissue necrosis was worst\nin the SCS group, followed by the ECMO+SCS group and being\nleast in the ECMO+NMP group.28 These findings suggested that\nFig. 1.

The above findings suggest that NMP\nmight be the best option to resuscitate organs exposed to\nextended warm ischemia time, as occurs in DCD donation.\nCurrent procurement protocols require in-situ flushing with\ncold UW solution or histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solu￾tion. There is concern regarding the effects of abrupt reperfu￾sion on the organ. The concept of controlled oxygenated\nrewarming was introduced by Minor et al.,\n29 initially as an\nadjunct to hypothermic perfusion. Banan et al.30 then com￾bined gradual rewarming with NMP and reported improved\nINR, bile production, cholangiocyte function and decreased\nendothelial damage compared to immediate NMP after 4 h of\ncold storage. However, these results were inferior to the group\nthat underwent NMP immediately without 4 h of cold storage.30\nSome investigators have looked at optimizing the outcomes\nfrom NMP through the addition of other adjuncts to the circuit.\nIn 2012, Chung et al.31 described the addition of a kidney to\nthe liver NMP circuit. Although the authors saw no improve￾ment in inflammatory cytokine expression, subsequent experi￾ments did find improvements in glucose, pH and renal\nparameters such as urea and creatinine. Liver function did\nnot appear to be compromised. Another study by the same\ngroup demonstrated that placing the kidney in the circuit\nbefore the liver, was more physiologic and produced better\nresults compared to the liver-first circuit.32–34 Although en\nbloc liver-kidney transplants are not mainstream, this finding\nrepresents another area of exploration in patients undergoing\ncombined liver-kidney transplantation.\nOther adjuncts include addition of pharmacologic mole￾cules to mitigate ischemic injury. Goldaracena et al.35\ndemonstrated improvement in liver function with the addition\nof anti-inflammatory strategies, including alprostadil and\nn-acetylcysteine. It is worth noting, however, that other studies\nhave shown decreased inflammation with NMP, even in the\nabsence of added anti-inflammatory compounds.36 The\nconcept of the addition of therapeutic compounds to the NMP\nperfusion circuit to improve outcomes following transplanta￾tion remains one of the areas of greatest potential growth in\nNMP technology and is, therefore, worth pursuing.\nSmall animal ex-vivo liver perfusion studies\nThere have been a limited number of rodent NMP studies due\nto their small size and lack of appropriate NMP technology, until\nrecently. The smaller size and decreased complexity, however,\noffers the ability to study different aspects of ex-vivo NMP per￾fusion at reduced cost. One of the earliest successful ex-vivo\nperfusions of a mouse liver was performed by Baba et al.37 in\n1988. In a proof-of-concept study, the group demonstrated\nstable ATP levels and minimal ischemia after 80 m of ex-vivo\nperfusion with oxygenated fluosol-DA.37 In 2008, Talboom and\ncolleagues38 were able to successfully resuscitate Lewis rat\nlivers using NMP after 45 m of warm ischemia and 2 h of\nsimple cold storage. The animals that received these perfused\nlivers had comparable survival to those with fresh livers, and\ndid better than those who received livers stored by SCS only.38\nThe same group, in 2012, used a mouse DCD model to study\nmachine perfusion/preservation at 208\nC, 308\nC and 378\nC. These\nlivers were subsequently transplanted, allowing for evaluation\nof long-term outcomes. Results showed that compared to SCS,\nwhere none of the recipients survived past 12 h, 100% of the\nrecipients from perfused livers (at all three temperatures)\nsurvived.39\nPerk et al.,\n40 using a DCD rat NMP model, developed a met￾abolic index of ischemic injury that could be used to evaluate\nex-vivo perfused ischemic livers, helping to predict the function\nand, as such, suitability for transplantation. Using perfusate\nglucose, urea and lactate levels, the model was able to distin￾guish between fresh and ischemic livers with 90% specificity.40\nA recent study by Op den Dries et al.41 showed that for both\nDCD and non-DCD rat livers, there was superior bile duct epi￾thelial integrity and maintenance of morphology in NMP com￾pared to SCS.41 Murine studies have also investigated the\nimpact of liver steatosis on outcomes. Given that liver steatosis\nis major risk factor for primary non-function posttransplanta￾tion,42 many investigators have evaluated the use of the NMP\ncircuit to de-fat the liver prior to transplantation, as well as\nmitigate IRI. Negrath et al.,\n43 using various defatting cocktails,\nshowed that successful defatting was associated with improved\nrecovery from IRI.43 Preconditioning of livers on the NMP circuit\nwith Nodosin,44 as well as with thrombomodulin,45 was also\nassociated with improvement in endothelial damage and in IRI.\nClinical studies\nEx-vivo perfusion studies using discarded human livers\n(w/o transplantation)\nDonor organ shortages and increasing use of marginal donor\norgans has been the major driver behind research on normo￾thermic ex-vivo perfusion. One of the significant challenges in\nworking with marginal organs is the absence of the necessary\ntools to adequately assess organs prior to transplantation. For\nthis reason, DCD has a high organ discard rate.46 In the USA,\nabout 10% of donated livers are discarded.47 NMP technology\nhas emerged as a means of viability testing, preservation and\nresuscitation of would-be-discarded organs for transplanta￾tion. These discarded organs have, in turn, expedited the\ntranslation of ex-vivo perfusion from animals to humans.\nIn 2013, Op den Dries and colleagues48 demonstrated\nthat this technology was feasible in human donor livers.\nFour discarded livers from donors underwent cold storage\nin histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (one in UW solution)\nfor 5–9 h, followed by 6 h of normothermic ex-vivo perfusion\nusing oxygenated packed red blood cells and fresh frozen\nplasma. Histological examination before and after perfusion\nshowed well-preserved morphology, without evidence of\nadditional hepatocellular injury, biliary ischemia or sinusoidal\ndamage. There was bile production from the livers and\ndecreased lactate in the perfusate during the study,48 consis￾tent with preserved hepatic function. Banan et al.49 showed a\n10% reduction in macroglobular steatosis with the addition of\nexendin-4 and L-carnitine to the NMP circuit. These findings\ncould be useful in resuscitation of steatotic livers.\nRetrospective studies/case reports in ex-vivo liver\nperfusion\nThere have been several clinical series demonstrating the use\nof NMP, but these have been limited to high-volume centers.\nIn January 2016, Perera et al.50 reported on the first liver\ntransplant from a graft resuscitated by NMP. The liver, which\nhad been subjected to 109 m of warm ischemia and 422 m of\ncold ischemia, had been rejected by all other centers. The\norgan was resuscitated with 416 m of NMP, after which it was\n278 Journal of Clinical and Translational Hepatology 2018 vol. 6 | 276–282\nAkateh C. et al: Ex-vivo liver perfusion – a literature review\n\nsuccessfully transplanted. Overall ex-vivo time from cross￾clamp to reperfusion was 13 h and 58 m. The recipient had\nan uneventful post-transplant course and was doing well at\n15-month follow-up.50\nWatson et al.51,52 also reported on similar successful cases,\nincluding one with 26 h ex-vivo (618-m cold storage, 8.5-h\nNMP perfusion, 412-m SCS). In 2016, Angelico et al.53 con￾ducted a retrospective review of six patients who had received\nliver grafts perfused with NMP as part of the OrganOx trial,\ncomparing them to SCS recipients with similar donor and\nrecipient characteristics. They found that NMP was associated\nwith better intraoperative mean arterial pressures at 90 s, less\nvasopressor requirement and less blood products compared to\nSCS.53 Mergental et al.54 also reported on a series of five livers\nthat had been previously rejected (four DCD and one nonDCD\nwith prolonged ischemia). Following resuscitation with the NMP\ncircuit, the livers showed good viability (perfusate lactate, bile\nproduction, vascular flows, and liver appearance). The livers\nwere all transplanted, and at 7 months post-transplant all\npatients were doing well.54\nWatson et al.55 also recently published another series of 12\npatients who received liver transplants from organs preserved\nby NMP. Six of the organs were perfused with perfusate at high\noxygen tensions. In this group, they noted five cases of post￾reperfusion syndrome, four cases of sustained vasoplegia and\none of primary non-function. The other six livers with perfusate\ncontaining physiologic oxygen tension did not show these com￾plications, suggesting hyperoxia during NMP could be detri￾mental to the organ.55\nClinical trials in ex-vivo perfusion\nIn addition to the case series reported above, there have been\na few Phase 1 pilot studies comparing NMP to SCS, or other\nmodalities. In all three trials, the investigators used the\nOrganOx Metra12 device for normothermic perfusion. Table 1\nsummarizes some of the major findings from these trials.\nThe above-noted Phase 1 trials of normothermic ex-vivo\nperfusion have demonstrated its non-inferiority to SCS.56–58\nIt is worth noting, however, that none of the livers in these\nNMP trials were specifically labeled as extended criteria or mar￾ginal organs. In at least two of the trials (Ravikumar et al.56 and\nSelzner et al.58), 80% of the livers were procured from brain\ndead donors. As previously noted, optimal organs generally\ntolerate SCS well, which is why this has been the standard for\ncare the last two to three decades. So, although these have\nbeen non-inferiority trials, it is plausible that the true benefits\nof NMP will be become evident in trials with direct comparison\nusing marginal livers. The authors of current trials have argued\nthat NMP studies using standard livers are necessary to prove\nthe feasibility of the technology before applying it to marginal\nlivers, where it is expected to have the most benefit.\nThere are several Phase 2 and randomized clinical trials\nunderway, and will hopefully address these concerns. The\ncurrent trials have proved the feasibility of this technology in\nliver transplantation.\nPredictions of organ utility/discard\nThere continues to be considerable debate about the best\nparameters to use to truly assess the organ prior to trans￾plantation. Regardless of parameters, however, NMP provides\na means of viability testing not afforded by SCS. Bile formation\nand secretion is generally accepted as a hallmark of liver graft\nfunction. Brockmann et al.24 have shown that bile output\n(as well as base excess, portal vein flow, and hepatocellular\nenzymes) were all markers of liver function in a porcine liver\ntransplant model. Sutton and colleagues59 showed that high\nbile output of more than 30 g in 1 h was consistent with\nlower necrosis and improved potassium and transaminase\nlevels, suggesting that this might be a good marker of viability.\nVarious perfusate markers have also been investigated as\nmarkers of liver function, viability and degree of hepatocyte\ndamage. Karangwa and colleagues60 reported that a high\nD-dimer level early-on in the NMP circuit predicts severe ische￾mia of reperfusion and poor graft function. Beta-galactosidase\nlevel in perfusate,61 factor V level,62 perfusate pH62 and bicar￾bonate level59 have all been demonstrated as markers of via￾bility. Other investigators have combined multiple parameters\nin an attempt to develop an algorithm than could be used to\nevaluate these organs. As previously noted, using a rat DCD\nmodel, Perk et al.40 developed a metabolic index of ischemic\ninjury using perfusate glucose, urea and lactate levels capable\nof distinguishing between fresh and ischemic livers with 90%\nspecificity. Bruinsma et al.63 advocated for the use of metab￾olomics (a comprehensive metabolic profile of the liver’s\ncondition) in combination with typical NMP parameters to\nbetter assess and characterize preserved livers.\nTable 1.

In 1967,\nSlapak et al.,\n14 fashioned a completely portable apparatus for\nhypothermic organ preservation including a 3-atmosphere\noxygen concentrator, which was used successfully to preserve\ncanine liver grafts ex-vivo before transplantation.14 HMP was\nfurther promoted by the development of the UW solution. In\n1990, Yanaga,15 working with Starzl, adapted the model MOX￾100 kidney perfusion machine into an ex-vivo liver perfusion\nsystem. HMP, however, did not gain full acceptance at that time\ndue to the ease of SCS with the UW solution and the cumber￾some nature of the HMP apparatus. Nevertheless, there was\ncontinued progress being made in the field, including multiple\nsmall and large animal studies.\nIn 2010, Guarrera et al.64 published the first prospective\ntrial of HMP in human subjects. In this study, 20 adults who\nreceived HMP-preserved livers were compared to a matched\ngroup of cohorts who had received livers preserved by SCS.\nThe investigators found no significant difference in overall\noutcome between the two groups.64 Since then, there have\nbeen more Phase 1 trials in hypothermic perfusion, including\na study by Guarrera et al.65 in 2015, which compared 31\nextended criteria livers preserved by HMP to 30 matched SCS\ncontrols. The researchers noted significantly less biliary\ncomplications in the HMP group versus the SCS group (4 vs. 13,\np = 0.016). There was one primary graft non-function case in\nthe HMP group and in the SCS group. Additionally, the hospital\nlength of stay was significantly shorter in the HMP group.65\nA similar study by Dutkowski et al. found significantly\ndecreased liver injury (peak alanine aminotransferase, cholan￾giopathy, biliary complications, and graft survival) in DCD\nlivers preserved by hypothermic oxygenated perfusion. They\nalso compared hypothermic oxygenate machine perfusion￾perfused livers to brain dead donors preserved in a standard\nfashion (SCS) and found no significant difference. While HMP\nappears to be advantageous over SCS, there is no clear benefit\nof HMP over NMP. Additionally, there have been no randomized\ntrials directly comparing HMP to NMP. Critics of HMP argue that,\nthis modality does not allow for full functional assessment of\nthe allograft, as the organs are not perfused at physiologic\ntemperature.\nThe future of normothermic ex-vivo perfusion\nThe most immediate need and benefit of ex-vivo donor organ\nperfusion is organ assessment and potential repair prior to\ntransplantation. The inability to adequately assess organs\nhas led to relatively low rate of organ utility, despite an ever￾increasing need.66,67 NMP and its ability to assess various\norgan parameters, including hepatic and portal artery resist￾ance, bile production and changes in transaminases, provide\nvaluable information that would aid in pre-transplant organ\nassessment. By providing a platform for pre-transplant assess￾ment, NMP will serve to expand the donor pool, especially with\nregards to DCD and steatotic donations, which are often chal￾lenging to adequately assess.7,68,69\nOne of the major challenges in liver transplantation is cold\nischemia time and the ability to reduce it. In 2009, Englesbe\net al.70 reported on Surgical Transplantation as one of the\nriskiest jobs in Medicine, owing to the need to procure and\ntransplant organs as quickly as possible.70 In many hospitals,\ntransplants are done at odd hours of the day, as organs must\nbe transplanted immediately to decrease cold ischemia time.\nNMP ex-vivo perfusion allows the ability to preserve the organ\nfor longer periods and to transplant it at a scheduled/desired\ntime. Not only can patients get their affairs in order, but trans￾plant surgeons will be able to have rest periods between pro￾curement and transplantation.\nMoreover, NMP has shown great promise in its ability to\npotentially mitigate the IRI associated with the procurement and\npreservation process, allowing for transplantation of improved\norgans. Extension of perfusion time, equally has potential\napplicability in combined organ transplantation. Ceulemans\net al.,\n71 in 2014, reported on the case of a patient with severe\ncystic fibrosis leading to pulmonary failure and liver fibrosis. The\npatient in that case underwent ex-vivo lung perfusion while the\nliver was being transplanted, as his liver disease was deemed\ntoo severe to allow for a lung transplant.71 A similar model could\nbe applied in a patient with more severe lung disease or heart\ndisease, who is unable to tolerate a liver transplant first. The\nliver could be placed on the NMP circuit, avoiding further cold\nischemia time while the other organ is being transplanted.\nAdditionally, exploratory therapies are now associated with\nNMP. One suggestion has been the addition of mesenchymal\nstem cells to the NMP circuit, to hopefully induce immune\ntolerance in the graft.72 Anti-apoptotic agents and cell protec￾tive agents can be added into the perfusate as a means to re￾engineer suboptimal organs to better tolerate IRI.73 Although\nnone of these have been employed in clinical trials or clinical\npractice, the opportunities abound. In a recent study, Goldar￾acena et al.74 reported on the recent use of the ex-vivo\nperfusion circuit to deliver Miravirsen to prevent hepatitis C\nvirus reinfection in porcine livers. This study, if translated to\nhuman livers, could have significant implications for the use\nhepatitis C virus-infected liver grafts, potentially in non￾infected recipients. The technique could also be extended to\npotential donors with other systemic infections or infectious\nrisk, expanding the donor pool.\nConclusions\nDespite the great success of liver transplantation, the current\ndonor organ shortage and the changes in donor demographics\nhave placed an increased emphasis on the ability to safely use\nmarginal organs. Although it has shown great promise in\nanimal studies and early clinical series, there is still a paucity\nof robust human trials on NMP to date. The efficacy and\nsuperiority of this preservation technique to current methods\nwill have to be demonstrated to justify the additional cost.\nConflict of interest\nThe authors have no conflict of interests related to this\npublication.\nAuthor contributions\nContributed to the study design (CA, EWB, SMB), manuscript\nwriting and critical revision (CA, EWB, BAW, SMB).\n280 Journal of Clinical and Translational Hepatology 2018 vol. 6 | 276–282\nAkateh C. et al: Ex-vivo liver perfusion – a literature review\n\nReferences\n[1] National Data – OPTN. 2017.

The review highlights the potential benefits of this technology, particularly in improving outcomes for extended criteria donor livers and reducing ischemic injury. Several studies have demonstrated successful resuscitation of livers using normothermic machine perfusion, resulting in improved postreperfusion hemodynamics and increased viability. Additionally, some researchers have explored the use of adjunctive therapies, such as anti-inflammatory agents and mesenchymal stem cells, during ex-vivo perfusion. The review also discusses the limitations and challenges of this technology, including the need for further optimization and standardization of protocols, as well as the high costs associated with the equipment and consumables required. Overall, the review suggests that ex-vivo liver perfusion has the potential to significantly improve liver transplantation outcomes, but further research is necessary to fully realize its potential."}

Models to predict intraoperative massive blood transfusion, prolonged mechani￾cal ventilation, or in-hospital mortality in liver transplant recipients have not been identi￾fied. In this study we aim to identify preoperative factors associated with the above men￾tioned complications. \nMethods: A retrospective observational analysis was conducted on data collected from \n124 orthotopic liver transplants performed at a single institution between 2014 and 2017. \nA multivariable logistic regression using backwards elimination was performed for three \ndefined outcomes (massive transfusion ≥ 10 units packed red blood cells (PRBC), pro￾longed mechanical ventilation > 24 h, and in-hospital mortality) to identify associations \nwith preoperative characteristics. \nResults: Statistically significant (P < 0.05) associations with massive transfusion ≥ 10 units \nPRBC were hepatocellular carcinoma and preoperative transfusion of PRBC. Significant \nassociations with prolonged mechanical ventilation > 24 h were hepatitis C, alcoholic hep￾atitis, elevated preoperative alanine aminotransferase, and hepatorenal syndrome.

Despite this, there are \nmany perioperative complications that arise during liver transplantation that contribute \nto perioperative mortality [1]. The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score has \nbeen useful in predicting mortality in patients awaiting liver transplantation [2,3]. How￾ever, the MELD score has been shown to have non- or low-predictive value for many com￾plications, including intraoperative massive blood transfusion [4,5] and prolonged mechan￾Received: March 18, 2019\nRevised: July 12, 2019 (1st); July 25, 2019 \n(2nd)\nAccepted: July 30, 2019\nCorresponding author: \nDennis Danforth, M.D. \nDepartment of Anesthesiology, University of \nCalifornia San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive La \nJolla, CA 92093, USA\nTel: +1-646-784-1497\nFax: +1-619-543-6476 \nEmail: ddanforth@ucsd.edu\nORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7369-8724\nClinical Research Article\nKorean J Anesthesiol 2020;73(1):30-35\nhttps://doi.org/10.4097/kja.19108\npISSN 2005–6419 • eISSN 2005–7563\nThe Korean Society of Anesthesiologists, 2020\nThis is an open-access article distributed under the \nterms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Com￾mercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/\nby-nc/4.0/), which permits unrestricted non-commer￾cial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, \nprovided the original work is properly cited.\nKorean Journal of Anesthesiology\n30 Online access in http://ekja.org\n\nical ventilation [6]. Models similar to the MELD score to predict in￾traoperative massive blood transfusion, prolonged mechanical ven￾tilation, or in-hospital mortality in liver transplant recipients have \nnot been identified [7–10]. We aimed to identify preoperative fac￾tors associated with massive transfusion ≥ 10 units packed red \nblood cells (PRBC), prolonged mechanical ventilation > 24 h, and \nin-hospital mortality in liver transplant recipients by conducting a \nretrospective review of comorbidities, preoperative abnormalities, \nand laboratory values. We hypothesized that specific pre-operative \npatient characteristics would be associated with the above men￾tioned complications. \nMaterials and Methods \nStudy sample \nData were collected retrospectively from the data warehouse of \nthe University of California, San Diego (UCSD) Healthcare Sys￾tems. All data from surgical patients undergoing orthotopic liver \ntransplantation from April 2014 to August 2017 were extracted. \nThe resulting dataset remained de-identified and did not contain \nsensitive patient-health information as defined by the UCSD Hu￾man Research Protections Program, and therefore, was exempt \nfrom the informed consent requirement and approved by our In￾stitutional Review Board (IRB), IRB number 171557. During the \nstudy period there was no change in surgery or anesthesia leader￾ship of the liver transplant program. \nData and outcomes \nThe outcomes studied were intraoperative massive transfusion \n≥ 10 units PRBC, prolonged mechanical ventilation > 24 h, and \nin-hospital mortality. Through literature review and expert dis￾cussion, we pre-determined factors potentially associated with \nthese outcomes. Characteristics collected for analysis included pa￾tient age, sex, body mass index, MELD score, etiology of liver fail￾ure (hepatitis C, hepatitis B, alcohol use, hepatocellular carcinoma \n[HCC], primary biliary cirrhosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis \n[NASH], cryptogenic, and ‘other’), comorbidities (hepatorenal \nsyndrome, hepatopulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, congestive \nheart failure, portopulmonary hypertension, coronary artery dis￾ease, end-stage renal disease, diabetes mellitus, coagulopathy, car￾diac valve abnormality, pulmonary hypertension, and diastolic \ndysfunction), preoperative laboratory values, and need for preop￾erative transfusion of PRBC, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, \nand platelets. \nStatistical analysis \nStatistical analysis was performed using R, a software environ￾ment for statistical computing (R Core Team [2013]. R: a language \nand environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Sta￾tistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. Available from http:// www.\nR-project.org/). A multivariable logistic regression using back￾wards elimination was performed for each of the three outcomes \n(transfusion ≥ 10 units PRBC, prolonged mechanical ventilation \n> 24 h, and in-hospital mortality) to identify associations. All \nvariables were included in the initial model building process of \nthe multivariate analysis. In a step-by-step fashion, we removed \none variable at a time from the model that had the highest P value \ngreater than 0.05. This was performed until all variables in the \nmodel had P < 0.05 in its association with the outcome. None of \nthe variables that were not statistically significant in its association \nwith the outcome were included in the final model. The odds ra￾tio (OR) and corresponding 95% CI were then reported. Multi￾collinearity was assessed with variance inflation factor (VIF). We \ndetermined that if VIF < 5, correlation between predictor vari￾ables were not high. In the multivariable logistic regression analy￾sis, all predictors demonstrated a VIF < 5. When summarizing \ndemographic data, categorical variables were summarized as \ncount and percentages, while continuous variables were reported \nas mean and standard deviation (SD). \nResults \nThe patient demographics of the 124 patients included in the \nstudy are shown in Table 1. The mean age was 55.3 years old (SD \n10.7 years). Of the patients, 59.7% were males. Etiologies of liver \nfailure are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Common co-morbidities \ninclude diabetes type II, hepatorenal syndrome, congestive heart \nfailure, end-stage renal disease, and coronary artery disease. All \nliver transplants during the study period were performed by a sin￾gle primary surgeon. Postoperative outcomes are shown in Table 3: \n55.6% of patients required intraoperative massive transfusion ≥ \n10 units of PRBC, 53.2% of patients required prolonged ventila￾tion > than 24 h, and 10.5% of patients died during the hospital￾ization. The mean number of days for postoperative ventilation \nwas 7.8 days (SD 15.5 days). The mean number of days for ICU \nand hospital length of stay were 8.9 days (SD 13.8 days) and 25.7 \ndays (SD 23.4 days), respectively. \nThe results of the final multivariable logistic regression model \nare listed in Table 4 with OR, 95% CI, and P value. Significant risk \nfactors for massive transfusion were HCC and preoperative trans￾fusion of PRBC.

Risk factors for postoperative ventilation greater than 24 h \nincluded hepatitis C, alcoholic hepatitis, elevated preoperative ALT, \nand hepatorenal syndrome.

The main findings of our study are: the \npresence of HCC and preoperative transfusion correlated with in￾traoperative massive transfusion of ≥ 10 units of PRBC. Hepatitis \nC, alcoholic hepatitis, and hepatorenal syndrome correlated with \nan increased risk of postoperative mechanical ventilation greater \nthan 24 h. Male sex correlated with a reduced risk of prolonged \nmechanical ventilation greater than 24 h. Hepatitis B and end￾stage renal disease correlated with an increase in in-hospital mor￾tality. \nMassive transfusion during liver transplantation has been asso￾32 https://doi.org/10.4097/kja.19108\nDanforth et al.·Risk factors in liver transplantation\n\nciated with higher mortality, prolonged length of stay, and in￾creased rate of infectious complications [11]. Improvement in in￾traoperative management has significantly decreased transfusion \nneeds and improved overall mortality and morbidity [12]. Cur￾rent research has primarily concentrated on intraoperative man￾agement. In contrast, we have concentrated on preoperative fac￾tors influencing morbidity and mortality of liver transplant recipi￾ents. Our statistical analysis demonstrates that patients with HCC \nand preoperative transfusion have an increased risk for massive \ntransfusion. \nThe increased risk of bleeding in HCC patients is likely due to \nthe rich blood supply of the tumor. The high pressure of arterial \nvascularization of the tumor is associated with increased rate of \nhemorrhage and difficulty obtaining hemostasis [13]. While this \nis not a modifiable risk factor, the presence of HCC should alert \nthe transplant team for potential higher transfusion needs. \nA recent study by Massicotte et al. [14] revealed that preopera￾tive anemia was associated with a higher risk of transfusion during \nliver transplant and suggests that optimizing hemoglobin before \nsurgery could be potentially valuable. This is consistent with our \nfinding preoperative anemia and preoperative transfusion to be \nsignificantly correlated with high transfusion requirement. This \ncould be that transfusion increases central venous pressure, which \nhas been found to be associated with increased bleeding [14]. \nWe report herein that hepatitis, C alcoholic hepatitis, and hepa￾torenal syndrome are correlated with mechanical ventilation \ngreater than 24 h. Male sex was found to have reduced the risk of \nmechanical ventilation greater than 24 h. In a previous analysis of \na nationwide database prolonged mechanical ventilation has been \nassociated with increased mortality and graft failure [7]. In this \nstudy female gender was also associated with increased need for \nprolonged mechanical venation and the authors attributed this to \nthe fact that female liver transplant patients seem to be older, \nmore frail, and potentially have more advanced liver failure [7]. \nNumerous studies have examined the association of post-trans￾plant mortality with postoperative decline in kidney function \n[15–17] and preoperative hepatorenal syndrome [18]. However, \nthese studies did not note the association of hepatorenal syn￾drome and prolonged ventilation, which we found to be statisti￾cally significant. The etiology of this association deserves closer \ninvestigation, but one hypothesis may be that the relative hyper￾volemia and increased capillary permeability of patients with \nhepatorenal syndrome may lead to increased work of breathing \nand poor gas exchange post-operatively. This may suggest that in￾creased attention to fluid status intraoperatively may be beneficial. \nPrior study of the association of hepatitis C and alcoholic cir￾rhosis with prolonged ventilation was not found in any of the lit￾erature reviewed for this study. Despite the unclear etiology of this \nassociation, the presence of hepatitis C or alcoholic cirrhosis may \nassist with risk stratification and patient planning. \nFinally, our data analysis found hepatitis B and end-stage renal \ndisease to have significant association with post-transplant \nin-hospital mortality. Impaired kidney function and post-trans￾plant mortality has been frequently reported, though most studies \nfound a postoperative decline in kidney function to have a higher \nassociation with long-term mortality than measurements of pre￾Table 4.

Our finding of an association between \nend-stage renal disease and in-hospital mortality is not unexpect￾ed, given the common postoperative complications seen in pa￾tients with end-stage renal disease. A large study of dialysis pa￾tients undergoing general surgery utilizing the American College \nof Surgeons NSQIP database found significantly increased rates of \ndeath, thromboembolism, stroke, myocardial infarction, pneumo￾nia, and urinary tract infections [19]. \nPrior studies of liver transplant outcomes have not found in￾creased mortality rates in patients with hepatitis B as compared to \nhepatitis C, alcoholic cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis, and malig￾nancy [20]. The etiology of our finding of significant association \nbetween hepatitis B and in-hospital mortality is unclear. One hy￾pothesis may be that fulminant hepatic failure represents an in￾creased proportion of the hepatitis B patients. \nOur results have to be seen within the context of its limitations. \nThis is a retrospective single center study. Though all results may \nnot be generalizable, the study period was chosen due to the stable \nsurgical, anesthesiology, and medicine transplant teams, which al￾lowed us to focus on the variables in question without having to \naccount for significant differences in patient care. The study pop￾ulation size of 124 is relatively small, which may have left the \nstudy underpowered to identify perioperative associations of \nsmaller effect. \nIn summary we hope that this study prompts further attempts \nto improve methodologies for predicting perioperative complica￾tions in orthotopic liver transplant patients. Though some conclu￾sions were consistent with the known pathophysiology of comor￾bidities, such as an association between end stage renal disease \nand in-hospital mortality, other etiologies remain elusive, such as \nan association between hepatitis C and prolonged mechanical \nventilation. These associations prompt many questions deserving \nof closer investigation. Further investigations should include a \nmore in-depth analysis, including removal of confounding vari￾ables, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and further analysis of \npostoperative events leading to mortality and prolonged mechan￾ical ventilation. Our goal in this and in future studies is to define \nand refine specific predictive values, allowing practitioners to \nhave a preliminary system of predicting which patients may have \nan increased risk of massive transfusion, prolonged mechanical \nventilation, and in-hospital mortality. \nAcknowledgements \nUC San Diego Department of Anesthesiology. \nConflicts of Interest \nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was re￾ported. \nAuthor Contributions\nDennis Danforth (Formal analysis; Writing – original draft; Writ￾ing – review & editing)\nRodney A.

The study analyzed data from 124 liver transplant patients and used logistic regression models to determine the significance of various preoperative factors. The results showed that the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and preoperative transfusion were significantly associated with intraoperative massive transfusion, while HCC, alcoholic hepatitis, and hepatorenal syndrome were associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation. Male sex was found to reduce the risk of prolonged mechanical ventilation. The study highlights the need for further investigations to define specific predictive values for identifying patients at increased risk of these complications. The study's limitations include the relatively small sample size, which may have left the study underpowered to identify associations for less significant effects. Future studies should focus on removing confounding variables, including exclusion and inclusion criteria, and further analyze postoperative events leading to mortality and prolonged mechanical ventilation.

This approach reduces liver \nmetabolic activity, allowing safe storage for up to 12–18h (refs. 1,2\n). \nRecently, the combination of supercooling with subzero storage \n(−4 °C) and hypothermic, as well as subnormothermic, machine \nperfusion achieved an extension of the preservation time of human \nlivers up to 27h (ref. 2\n). By contrast, human livers can also be kept \nmetabolically fully active for up to 24h by supplying normothermic \nblood or oxygenated fluids in a controlled environment by machine \nperfusion1,3–5\n. The possibility of repairing poor-quality livers suffi￾ciently to enable transplantation requires preserving metabolically \nactive livers1,3\n for several days. Accordingly, the need for long-term \norgan preservation technology has been endorsed by multiple pri￾vate and governmental initiatives1\n. However, currently used normo￾thermic machine perfusion technologies have been used only for a \nrelatively short time period (for example, a median perfusion time \nof 9h (ref. 5\n)), to successfully maintain hemodynamics, perfusate \noxygenation and temperature.\nWe sought to extend perfusion time beyond 24h by engineer￾ing a perfusion machine that recapitulates additional core body \nfunctions that are critical to liver health. We chose 7-d as a target \nbecause this time period has been shown to offer a credible time \nframe for inducing clinically relevant liver regeneration in patients \nundergoing complex liver resection6–8\n. Under physiologic condi￾tions, the liver, which constitutes 2.5% of body weight, receives \n25% of the blood output of the heart and performs >5,000 func￾tions9\n. It has a unique dual vascular supply with high-pressure, \noxygen-rich arterial blood entering through the hepatic artery and \nlow-pressure, oxygen-reduced portal vein blood draining the \nabdominal viscera. Its high metabolic activity produces waste \nproducts that are excreted in the bile or removed by hepatic mac￾rophages or the kidneys. The metabolic profile is largely controlled \nby pancreatic hormones, including insulin and glucagon. Our per￾fusion technology, developed in the “Liver4Life project”, includes \nautomated control of glucose levels by injection of insulin and glu￾cagon, a dialysis membrane for waste-product removal, regulation \nof oxygenation and liver movement to prevent pressure necrosis.\nResults\nLiver perfusion machine. Our perfusion machine (Fig. 1a,b) reca￾pitulates blood supply through the two vascular entries of the liver, \nthe hepatic artery and portal vein. The hepatic artery is supplied \nwith oxygen-rich blood at elevated pressure (mean arterial pressure \n(MAP)≥65mmHg) in a pulsatile manner (Fig. 1c), whereas the por￾tal vein receives blood at low pressure (around 5–10mmHg) with a \nreduced oxygen content (venous blood, non-pulsatile). The system \nmaintains oxygen saturation of 65% in the vena cava by continu￾ously adjusting oxygen content in the portal vein (Fig. 1d). In vivo, \nnutrients and bile salts are transported from the intestine to the liver \nvia the portal vein. To recapitulate this, we inject parenteral nutri￾tion and ursodeoxycholic acid into the portal vein line of our perfu￾sion machine. Hepatic artery hemodynamics are tightly controlled \nby automated infusion of vasoconstrictors and vasodilators (Fig. 1e) \ninto the hepatic artery line. The pressure in the vena cava is con￾tinuously kept at physiological levels close to 0mmHg (0–2mmHg) \nto prevent liver congestion.

We incorporated an integrated dialysis unit for physiologic \nelectrolyte balance and removal of metabolic waste products from \nthe blood.\nWe used an algorithm to automatically adjust the dialysate flow, \ncontrolling the concentration of red blood cells (hematocrit) on \nthe basis of continuous measurements (Fig. 1f). Automated insulin \n(Fig. 1g) and glucagon administration was used to maintain physi￾ological blood glucose levels (targeted range of 3.5–6.5mmoll\n−1\n) in \nresponse to continuous glucose measurements. Continuous move￾ment of the liver, in an effort to mimic diaphragm oscillations, is \nalso integrated into the system (Supplementary Fig. 1). The perfu￾sion machine is fully automated obviating the need for constant \npresence of personnel. Features of the described long-term perfu￾sion technology as compared to the commercially available perfu￾sion machines are summarized in Fig. 1h.\nThrough early experiments using pig livers we identified five \nmajor hurdles, each limiting successful long-term liver preservation \nwith blood-based perfusate, namely, control of glucose metabolism, \nprevention of hemolysis, removal of waste products, control of per￾fusate oxygenation and simulation of diaphragm movement (Fig. 2). \nThese obstacles were studied and overcome through incremental \nsteps using 70 healthy pig livers, before initiating the human study.\nGlucose metabolism. We first perfused pig livers with a hyper￾glycemic perfusate (perfusate glucose >10mmoll\n−1\n) at fixed \ninsulin injection rates (0.9Uh−1\n). Although glucose is not the pri￾mary energy source for hepatocytes10, perfusion protocols avail￾able in the literature4,5,11,12 have used this approach. For example, \nthe pioneering randomized controlled trial of normothermic liver \nperfusion in humans also reported high glucose levels in the per￾fusate (>10mmoll\n−1\n) at a constant insulin injection rate (7Uh−1\n)5\n. \nHowever, using this approach, we observed high insulin concentra￾tions in the perfusate (229±72pmoll\n−1\n), which led to activation of \nglycogen synthase and excessive glycogen deposition in liver tissue, \nsimilar to what is seen in glycogen-storage diseases (Fig. 2a,c and \nSupplementary Fig. 2).\nIn the next series of experiments, we reduced glucose levels in \nthe perfusate to 4mmoll\n−1\n by manually adjusting the glucose infu￾sion rate resulting in considerable reduction of glycogen deposition \n(Fig. 2a). The persistence of high levels of insulin (0.9Uh−1\n), how￾ever, resulted in activation of glucose uptake by hepatocytes and \ndeprivation of glucose for erythrocytes in the perfusate (erythro￾cytes rely only on glucose as an energy source owing to their lack \nof mitochondria), implying failure of manual control (Fig. 2b and \nSupplementary Fig. 2). Therefore, we included a device with auto￾mated monitoring of glucose levels in the perfusate using a continu￾ous online sensor (Figs. 1g and 2a,c, and Supplementary Fig. 2). We \nimplemented closed-loop control of glucose levels by automatically \ninjecting insulin and glucagon (Supplementary Fig. 1).\nMinimizing hemolysis. Hemolysis is a common shortcoming in \nliver perfusion systems using blood-based perfusates owing to expo￾sure to foreign surfaces and non-pulsatile perfusion of the hepatic \nartery. Elevated hemolysis with a non-pulsatile pump is potentially \nexplained by sludge and erythrocyte stasis, which is prevented with \npulsatile perfusion13–16.\nTo decrease hemolysis in our system, we opted for a perfusion \nloop design with only one pump head and one oxygenator despite \nhaving a dual perfusion route. Pulsatile flow in the hepatic artery \nwas generated by varying the rotational speed of the centrifugal \npump head with a targeted MAP of 65mmHg and 60 beats per \nminute creating a pulse waveform that mimicked the in vivo set￾ting (Fig. 1c). Pulsatile flow caused a significantly lower degree of \nhemolysis (0.2±0.1 g l\n−1\n versus 0.7±0.2 g l\n−1\n; P<0.001) after 24h of \nperfusion (Fig. 2d) as compared to non-pulsatile flow.\nElectrolyte control. We observed elevated sodium levels (hyperna￾tremia) during liver perfusion, reaching levels of up to 200mmoll\n−1\n, \nwhich has detrimental effects on organ viability. Serum sodium \nconcentrations of >165mmoll\n−1\n in liver donors is considered an \nextended criterion, which was observed in a human liver perfu￾sion without an integrated dialysis system5,17. To prevent hyperna￾tremia, we integrated a dialysis membrane in the perfusion loop, \nperforming critical excretory kidney functions (Figs. 1f and 2e). \nAn additional effect of dialysis was the automated modulation of \na transmembrane flow (TMF) of dialysate across the dialysis fil￾ter membrane, which allows the control of the hematocrit level \n(Fig. 2f). These refinements enabled us to run perfusion for 7-d \nwithout the need for exchanging the perfusate or using any addi￾tional blood products. In addition, dialysis also removed metabolic \nwaste products, such as blood urea nitrogen (BUN; Fig. 2g).\nPhysiologic venous oxygen saturation in the portal vein. Despite \nthe uniform delivery of highly oxygenized blood through the \nhepatic artery, most reported liver perfusion systems provide \nnon-physiologic arterial blood also through the portal vein4,5,11,12. \nHowever, in our preliminary experiments we found that hyperoxy￾genation in the portal vein was associated with the need for high \namounts of vasodilators (285±162milliliter per week) to maintain \na physiologic flow in the hepatic artery (Fig. 2h,i); a finding consis￾tent with other reports indicating enhanced arterial vasoconstric￾tion owing to hyperoxygenation18,19. To avoid over oxygenation in \nthe portal vein, we mixed the deoxygenated venous blood from the \nblood reservoir with the freshly oxygenated blood from the oxygen￾ator. An algorithm enabled automatic adjustment of oxygen satura￾tion in the portal vein to maintain a target saturation of 65% in the \nvena cava (Fig. 1d). With this approach, the need for vasodilators \ndecreased from 285±162milliliters per week to 41±34milliliters \nper week (P=0.011), despite maintaining physiologic flow in the \nhepatic artery (Fig. 2i).\nLiver movement. In the human body, the liver and other organs move \nrhythmically owing to attachment to the diaphragm.

An inflatable balloon \nwas positioned beneath the mat and connected to an air oscillator to \ninduce oscillating movement (automated lifting and lowering) of the \nliver 15 times per minute (Supplementary Fig. 1). To test adequate \nperfusion after 7d of ex vivo perfusion, we evaluated the distribu￾tion of the radioactive tracer 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), as an \nindicator of preserved metabolism and viability inside the liver with \npositron emission tomography combined with computed tomogra￾phy (PET-CT). This approach demonstrated homogeneous metab￾olism and iodinated contrast medium distribution with absence of \nnon-perfused areas in contact places to the silicon mat (Fig. 2k).\nEarly phase of reperfusion of pig livers after 7-d perfusion. We \ntested the viability of eight pig livers perfused with autologous \nblood after 1 week of perfusion without exchanging the perfusate \nor adding any blood products. All livers showed preserved liver \nfunctions with production of bile flow over the entire perfusion \nperiod (Supplementary Fig. 3). While we observed an initial tem￾porary increase of injury markers such as aspartate aminotrans￾ferase (AST) and 8-hydroxydesoxyguanosin (8-OHdG) within the \nfirst 12h of perfusion, these values declined in the following days \n(Supplementary Fig. 3). Cytochrome C, an established marker for \nmitochondrial membrane injury, did not increase over the 7-d \nperiod and histology after 7-d of perfusion revealed no relevant \nnecrosis or features of endothelial activation (Supplementary \nFigs. 3 and 4).\nTo test in vivo reperfusion injury and viability after a 7-d perfu￾sion, we transplanted three livers in recipient pigs of similar size. As \ncontrols, we also transplanted five livers that had been kept only for \n2–3h with static cold storage before transplantation22. The aim of \nthese experiments was to confirm feasibility of vascular anastomo￾ses and to investigate the early phase of reperfusion after long-term \nperfusion. All transplant experiments were terminated 3h after \ntransplantation under general anesthesia because survival experi￾ments with cessation of general anesthesia were prohibited by our \nlocal animal protection authorities. Therefore, the main endpoints \nof these transplantation experiments remained early markers of \nreperfusion injury, including release of transaminases and histol￾ogy. These results indicated no difference between release of liver \nenzymes and histology as compared to controls livers that had been \ntransplanted after standard cold storage without long-term preser￾vation in the machine perfusion system22 (Supplementary Fig. 5).\nSeven-day perfusion and assessment of human livers. Next we \napplied the technology to human livers. Although pig and human \nlivers have similar size and architecture, several substantial adjust￾ments were necessary to successfully perfuse human livers. First, \nin contrast to pig liver perfusion with autologous fresh donor pig \nblood, the perfusate used for human livers consisted of preserved \npacked human blood products with altered electrolyte levels (for \nexample, high potassium (>10mmol) and low pH (<7.0)). Thus, \nelectrolyte levels and pH were corrected through an integrated \ndialysis before starting perfusion. Second, pig and human livers dis￾closed differences in the sensitivity toward glucagon, with the need \nto adjust glucagon levels (0.11Uml−1\n in human versus 0.01Uml−1\nin pigs). Third, the vasodilator nitroprussiat used in pigs is not \napproved for human use in Switzerland and was therefore replaced \nby epoprostinolium (Flolan, GlaxoSmithKline)11. Fourth, the final \nhuman protocol includes ursodeoxycholic acid, which is commonly \nused in the clinic, in place of taurocholic acid derivatives for bile \nflow stimulation.\nWe perfused ten human livers that had been declined for trans￾plantation by all hospitals in Switzerland, then in all Europe owing \nto poor quality, and as such were to be discarded (Supplementary \nTable 1). We connected the human livers to the ex vivo perfusion \nmachine through the hepatic artery, portal vein, vena cava and bile \nduct. The perfusion was conducted using a blood-based perfusate, \nreconstituted from packed erythrocytes, fresh frozen plasma, albu￾min and platelets (Supplementary Table 2) at 34 °C owing to protec￾tive effects at this temperature23.\nIn standard clinical transplantation, organs are preserved at about \n4 °C under anaerobic conditions for up to 12–18h before implanta￾tion. Many of these livers suffer additionally from prepreservation \ninjury (that is, injury occurring before recovery of the organ owing \nto, for example, instability of the donor before death or medical \ntreatment in intensive care units) and ischemia–reperfusion injury \nat the time of preservation and transplantation24. Consequently, cell \ndeath (~15%) is observed in most post-transplant biopsy speci￾mens, even under optimal clinical conditions25,26. Similar to clini￾cal transplantation, ischemia–reperfusion injury is unavoidable in \nmachine-perfused livers when connecting the liver to the machine \nafter cold storage and subsequently perfusing with oxygenated per￾fusates. To assess the livers during machine perfusion, we measured \na number of parameters. In the perfusate, we monitored hepatocel￾lular enzymes (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and AST), signaling \nFig. 2 | Step-by-step integration of the components for long-term perfusion using pig livers. a, Amount of glycogen per milligram of liver tissue according \nto the glucose-level control method. In the hyperglycemic group, hyperglycemia (>10 mmol l−1\n) in the perfusate was maintained by constant glucose \ninfusion (n= 4 pig livers). In the normoglycemic group, a targeted glucose level of 4 mmol l−1\n was maintained by manual adjustment of the glucose infusion \n(n= 4 pig livers). In the automated control group, glucose was never infused but was rather released from the liver by gluconeogenesis during a basal \ninsulin injection.

However, PAS staining detected an unequivocal gly￾cogen loss in non-viable areas in livers 7 to 10 as compared to \nhomogenous staining in livers 1 to 6. These findings suggest an \nunequal qualitative glycogen distribution in livers 7 to 10 without \na change in total glycogen amount as compared to livers 1 to 6 \n(Supplementary Fig. 6).\nBy contrast, hematoxylin and eosin staining of livers 7 to 10 \nshowed higher injury, accompanied by low glucose levels in the per￾fusate at perfusion termination (Fig. 3e). Continuous substitution of \nglucose was necessary in these livers to maintain physiological per￾fusate glucose levels, similar to severe liver failure in clinical cases.\nLivers 1 to 6 generally had endothelial cells with intact struc￾ture as assessed by immunohistochemistry of von Willebrand fac￾tor and mRNA level detection of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 \n(ICAM1) (Supplementary Fig. 6). By contrast, livers 7 to 10 gener￾ally showed activation of von Willebrand factor in areas of necrosis \nand elevated ICAM1 mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig. 6).\ng h i\nd e f\na b c\nj k\nOxygen consumption\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n0123 4 5 6 7\nTime (d)\n0 123 4 5 6 7\nTime (d)\n0 1234567\nTime (d)\nLivers 7–10\nLivers 1–6\nLivers 7–10\nLivers 1–6\nLivers 7–10\nLivers 1–6\nOxygen consumption\n (ml \nO2 per min per\n 100 g of liver) Albumin (g dl–1)\nATP (nmol per mg\n of protein)\nLac (mmol–1)\n0 1 234 5 6 7\nTime (d)\n0\n0\n1234567\nTime (d)\n0123456 7\nTime (d)\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nTime (d)\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nTime (d)\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nTime (d)\n012 3 456 7\nTime (d)\nLivers 7–10\nLivers 1–6\nLivers 7–10\nLivers 1–6\nLivers 7–10\nLivers 1–6\nLiver 7\nLivers 1–6\nLiver 7\nLivers 1–6 Livers 7–10\nLivers 1–6\nLivers 7–10\nLivers 1–6\n6,000\n4,000\n2,000\n0\n15\n10\n5\n0\nTissue: ATP Perfusate: lactate\nPerfusate: albumin Perfusate: ammonia Perfusate: factor V\nBile flow Bile: total bilirubin Perfusate: free hemoglobin\nPerfusate: hematocrit\n6\n4\n2\n0\n300\n200\n100\nAmmonia (µmol–1)\n200\n100\n0\nFactor V (%) Free hemoglobin (g l–1)\n10\n5\n0\n3,000\n2,000\n1,000\n0\nTotal bilirubin (µmol l–1)\nBile flow (ml h–1)\n40\n20\n0\n60\n40\n20\n0\nHematocrit (%)\n** *\n* *\nNS\nNS\nNSNS\nNS NS\nNS\nNS NS\nNS\nNS\nNS\nNS\nNS\nNS\nNS\nNS\nNS NS NS NS NS\nNS\nNS NS\nNS\nNS\nNS\nNS\n*\nNS\nNS\nNS\nNS\nNS\nNS\nNS\nNS NS NS\nNS NS\nNS\nNSNS\nNS\nNS **\nNS\nNS\nNS NS NS\nNS\nFig. 4 | Liver function during human liver perfusion (n= 10 livers). a,b, Oxygen consumption (a), and ATP levels (b).

Under physi￾ologic conditions, hepatic artery flow is tightly controlled by the \nautonomic nervous system and vasoactive substances, which are \ndependent on liver signals, whereas portal vein flow acts indepen￾dently9\n. The hepatic artery response to vasoactive substances is \ntherefore a valuable sign of organ viability9\n. With a flow of 1 lmin−1\n, \nthe portal pressure could be maintained in physiological range \n(<10mmHg) in each liver except in two livers (livers 1 and 3) \nthat had pre-existing fibrosis and cirrhosis (portal vein pressure \n12–15mmHg), a typical feature observed in the clinic with patients \nsuffering from injured parenchyma. For livers 1 to 6, flow rates in \nthe hepatic artery remained constant with infusion of vasoactive \nsubstances (Figs. 1e and 5a). By contrast, livers 7 to 10 became \nunresponsive to even high amounts of vasoconstrictors (vasoplegia) \nshortly after initiating perfusion (n=1) or on day 4 (n=2). This \nvasoplegia translated into a pressure of less than 45mmHg in the \nhepatic artery despite high vasoconstrictor infusion at a hepatic \nartery flow of 0.6 lmin−1\n (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 7).\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we developed a perfusion machine preserving pig and \nhuman livers for 1 week with consistently good outcomes as assessed \nby intact liver structure on histology and preserved function as indi￾cated by bile production, synthesis of blood proteins, maintenance \nof cellular energy (ATP), as well as an appropriate response to pan￾creatic hormones or vasoactive drugs. Because of restrictions by our \nlocal animal protection authorities, we were not able to assess trans￾plantation efficacy beyond the time of extubation, but observation \nfor a few hours after reperfusion showed no differences between \nlivers perfused for 1 week as compared to the control group trans￾planted after a standard short period of cold storage.\nThe human livers available for this inaugural study were severely \ninjured and heterogeneous with respect to cold and warm ischemia \ntimes, underlying liver diseases, donor age, duration of intensive care \nunit treatment among other parameters (Supplementary Table 1). \nBecause of an organ shortage in our country, a control group of less \ninjured livers is not available, as such livers are consistently used \nfor transplantation27,28. The heterogeneity and poor quality of the \nlivers poses difficulties in assessing the outcome overall. However, \nthe many measurements obtained throughout the 1-week perfusion \nat 34 °C suggest that many of the livers maintained viability and to \nsome extent recovered from prepreservation and initial ischemia–\nreperfusion injuries following connection to the machine.\nIn addition, several parameters of viability remain difficult to \nassess, such as the long-term viability of intrahepatic bile ducts. The \ndevelopment of bile duct strictures occurs in some grafts up to 1 year \nafter transplantation, typically as a result of prolonged warm isch￾emic injury29. Previous studies suggested glucose clearance in bile as \na sign of cholangiocyte viability4,30, proposing a bile/perfusate glu￾cose ratio less than 0.7 as a cut off for predicting viability30. Notably, \nthese criteria were all met in our perfused livers (Supplementary \nFig. 8). The final proof of bile duct integrity, however, can only be \nassessed after transplantation of perfused livers in recipients with at \nleast a 1-year follow-up29. Similarly, coagulation, an additional typi￾cal parameter of liver synthesis31, was difficult to monitor during ex \nvivo perfusion. Interpretation of factor V and international normal￾ized ratio (INR) during ex vivo perfusion is limited owing to the \nheparinised circuit32.\nTherefore, we interpreted liver function by a combination of \nATP synthesis, bile flow, ammonia clearance and BUN production, \nas well as by the need for glucose substitution, which is another \nwell-known marker of irreversible hepatocellular injury. These \nparameters were combined with the response of the livers to added \nvasoconstrictors, as failing liver grafts are frequently characterized \nby severe vasoplegia, requiring high dosages of vasoconstrictors to \nmaintain adequate blood flow in the clinical setting33. Some livers \nbecame unresponsive to vasoconstrictors during the perfusion \ncourse. The reason for failure in those livers probably relates to \nexcessive warm or cold ischemia times, in combination with prep￾reservation injury recognized in the clinic as extended graft criteria, \nenhancing severe ischemia–reperfusion injury17. In Fig. 5, we sum￾marize our current understanding of how to best assess liver func￾tion and viability during ex vivo perfusion. Besides the conventional \nparameters (that is, lactate clearance, perfusate pH and bile produc￾tion) as previously proposed4,34–36, we rely on the response to glyco￾lytic hormones, vasoactive drugs and on clearance of ammonia, as \nwell as histology and ATP synthesis.\nBile production, which is one of the most convincing indicators \nof liver viability after transplantation31, was present in the majority \nof livers perfused for 1 week.\nSome of the human livers perfused for 1 week displayed a course \nof laboratory parameters and histology that was similar to those \nobserved in the clinical setting of liver transplantation. For example, \nas in some of the livers perfused for 1 week, AST and ALT levels \npeak at around day 1, likely owing to some hepatocyte injury upon \nreperfusion, but decline rapidly thereafter similar to successful \nclinical liver transplantation31,37. Likewise, blood bilirubin increased \nduring ex vivo perfusion with a delay in some livers as compared to \nliver enzymes37.\nWe did observe that the perfused livers consistently lost weight \nduring the 7-d perfusion period, reaching about 25% of the initial \ngraft mass. While the underlying mechanisms and clinical relevance \nof this finding remains unclear, we speculate that this phenomenon \nis largely related to recovery of mainly cellular swelling in injured \nlivers, and therefore without negative impact on hepatic func￾tion. Similarly, the well-established circadian liver weight fluctua￾tion has no negative impact on hepatic function38. Of note, we did \nnot observe any weight change when using healthy pig livers \n(preperfusion weight of 1.7±0.03 kg, post-perfusion weight \n1.6±0.1 kg). A similar loss of liver weight without substantial \nimpact on function has been observed during short-term normo￾thermic perfusion of livers from donations after circulatory death \nor steatotic liver grafts12.\nWe grouped the livers on the basis of organ viability and pre￾served integrity on histology on 1-week perfusion. Livers 7 to 10 \nfailed to reach the targeted perfusion duration developing signs of \nprogressive liver failure, which required premature termination of \nperfusion. The observation of failure to respond to hormones and \nvasoactive drugs, loss of integrity on histology, as well as the absence \nof decline in injury and inflammation markers in perfusate in failed \nlivers, offered a solid base to assess viability in long-term liver \nperfusion. These parameters may be advantageous over conven￾tionally used liver function parameters in the clinic and in selection \nof grafts for transplantation (Fig. 5), which were not substantially \ndifferent in our system. However, further studies will be needed to \ndetermine which are the best measures of liver viability after long￾term perfusion.\nOverall, the results in group 1 livers (livers 1 to 6) are promising \nand suggest that machine perfusion for 1 week may support viabil￾ity of human livers, although testing with higher-quality livers and \ntransplantation of perfused livers into recipients will be required to \nfully assess the potential of our approach.\nIn ischemia–reperfusion injury, reoxygenation of ischemic \ncells triggers a burst of reactive oxygen species, which are released \nmainly by mitochondria25. Consequently, machine perfusion strat￾egies should target primarily mitochondrial metabolism39, for \nexample, by applying membrane-permeable scavengers and revers￾ible inhibitors of electron transfer, or by prevention of the open￾ing of permeability transition pores. An ex vivo system offers the \npotential advantage of avoiding such undesirable systemic effects \nin the recipient. We envision our technology being used primarily \nwith organs currently declined for transplantation, with long-term \nNature Biotechnology | VOL 38 | February 2020 | 189–198 | www.nature.com/naturebiotechnology 197\n\nArticles Nature Biotechnology\nex vivo perfusion under physiologic conditions potentially enabling \nthe rescue of organs or their modification in a variety of ways. For \nexample, 1-week perfusion may enable repair of severely steatotic \nlivers, modification of the immunogenicity of the graft or recipient \nto induce tolerance, or treatment of tumors in livers using effec￾tive chemotherapeutic agents that are too toxic for systemic use. In \naddition, long-term perfusion would allow organs to be transported \nsafely over long distances, improving worldwide organ sharing and \nlogistics for transplantation in many centers1,3\n. Another opportunity \nin the future might be to enable liver regeneration, with a donor \nliver split into several anatomic segments to regrow in the machine. \nRecent surgical procedures have shown that massive liver regenera￾tion in humans can occur within 6d of major tissue loss7\n. If feasible, \nsuch an approach could double or even triple the availability of \norgans for transplantation. We may also imagine the use of partial \ngrafts for auto-transplantation in patients with liver cancer, obviat￾ing the need for immune suppression.\nIn summary, this study introduces a perfusion technology devel￾oped by a group of surgeons, biologists and engineers that enables \nmaintenance of injured human livers in a functional state for 1 week \nex vivo. With further testing to demonstrate its use with injured liv￾ers and long-term transplantation success, this machine may pro￾vide an avenue for providing more patients with liver grafts.\nOnline content\nAny methods, additional references, Nature Research reporting \nsummaries, source data, extended data, supplementary informa￾tion, acknowledgements, peer review information; details of author \ncontributions and competing interests; and statements of data and \ncode availability are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-\n019-0374-x.\nReceived: 23 December 2018; Accepted: 18 November 2019; \nPublished online: 13 January 2020\nReferences\n1.

The declined livers were procured in a standardized technique \nusing IGL-1 for cooling and preservation. Some livers from donations after \ncirculatory death were declined after initial hypothermic oxygenated liver machine \nperfusion for clinical purpose28 (Supplementary Table 1). During setup of the \nperfusion machine, the livers were prepared on the back table including removal \nof the gall bladder and cannulation of the hepatic artery, portal vein, vena cava \nand bile duct. Shortly before the start of liver perfusion, the preservation solution \nwas flushed out with 2 l of cold (4 °C) Ringerfundin solution (B. Braun Melsungen) \nthrough the portal vein (1.5 l) and hepatic artery (0.5 l).\nPerfusion machine and protocol for human livers. Hemodynamic control. One \ncentrifugal pump (Thoratec CentriMag) in combination with three pinch valves \n(Resolution Air MPPV-8) were used to maintain the desired flow or pressure \nconditions in the perfusion system. Flow sensors (Sonoflow CO.56) and pressure \nsensors (PendoTECH Single Use Pressure Sensors) measured flow and pressure in \nthe respective silicon tube (RAUMEDIC) lines. Thereby, the control system aimed \nto maintain a desired flow (for example, 1 lmin−1\n) in the portal vein and the desired \npressure conditions in the hepatic artery. To increase its resistance and provide the \nrequired flow rate ratio between the portal vein and hepatic artery, a pinch valve \nclamps the tube leading to the portal vein. In the hepatic artery, a pulsatile flow was \napplied targeting an MAP of at least 65mmHg (for example, systolic and diastolic \npressure of 80mmHg to 50mmHg respectively with 60 beats per minute), while \nlimiting the mean hepatic-artery flow to a maximum of 0.6 lmin−1\n. Pulsatile flow in \nthe hepatic artery was realized by pulsatile operation (varying rotational speed) of \nthe blood pump. Thereby, the rotational speed of the pump was defined in the same \nwaveform as the desired arterial pressure pulse.\nTo prevent the flow in the hepatic artery from exceeding 0.6 lmin−1\n, the system \ninjected the vasoconstrictor Neo Synephrine HCL (phenylephrine, Ospedalia) \nat an upper bound of 0.55 lmin−1\n. On the other hand, to maintain a lower limit \nat least 0.25 lmin−1\n, the system injected the vasodilator Flolan (epoprostenol, \nGlaxoSmithKline). In both cases, this was realized by means of a proportional \nintegral controller, defining the infusion rate on the basis of the measured hepatic￾artery flow rate.\nVena cava pressure control. Inadequate blood outflow from the liver leads to \na vascular congestion and an ischemic hepatocellular damage. Thus, the \nsystem controlled the vena cava pressure around the atmospheric pressure \n(approximately 0mmHg).\nThe vena cava was connected via tube set directly to the blood reservoir. \nBy means of the height difference between the liver and the reservoir, a suction \npressure was induced and additionally controlled through a pinch valve between \nthe vena cava and the reservoir to control a desired vena cava pressure. The pinch \nvalve induced an additional pressure drop, allowing elevation of the pressure at \nthe vena cava to the desired levels. If the blood pressure inside the vena cava was \nlower than the surrounding ambient pressure, the vessel wall collapsed (usually \naround 0mmHg), closed shortly and therefore induced a certain (negative) \npressure fluctuation in the VC line. This induced pressure fluctuation was utilized \nin the control system to target the desired vena cava pressure. Finally, this pressure \nfluctuation (collapse of the vena cava) was detected by the pressure sensor in the \nvena cava line, with the control system reacting accordingly by closing the pinch \nvalve in the vena cava line and thereby increasing the target vena cava pressure \nautomatically by 1mmHg, slightly above the fluctuation point. The system \ncontinuously monitored the minimum and maximum value of the vena cava \npressure of the last 30 s. If the difference between the minimum and maximum \nvena cava pressure in this time interval was greater than a certain threshold defined \nby the system (usually 10mmHg), a fluctuation was detected. Afterward, the \ncontrol system immediately increased the pressure in the vena cava line by a value \nof 1mmHg, as described above. During normal operation, the system continuously \nsearched for the fluctuation point. This was done by permanently decreasing the \npressure set point for the vena cava by a rate of 1mmHg per hour. Once fluctuation \nhad been detected, the set point was again increased using the algorithm described \nabove, and the system again began to search for the fluctuation pressure. This \ncontrol strategy was implemented owing to the fact that the pressure distribution \ninside the vena cava line depended on the flow rate and therefore the vena cava \npressure was also flow-rate dependent. During the perfusion duration, the total \nflow rate through the vena cava line always varied over time. Therefore, a steady \nsearch for the fluctuation point was implemented (Supplementary Fig. 1).\nFeedback-controlled injection of insulin and glucagon. An online glucose sensor \n(CITSens Bio Glucose Sensor, C-CIT Sensor) was integrated into the arterial line \nfor real-time perfusate glucose measurement. The integrated sensor continuously \nmeasured the glucose in the perfusate. The blood glucose level was kept in a \nrange defined by the user. If the blood glucose value surpassed the desired level, \nthe system automatically injected insulin (Actrapid, Novo Nordisk Pharma), or, \nif the blood glucose undershot a lower threshold, the system injected glucagon \n(GlucaGen, Novo Nordisk Pharma) in a closed-loop manner to maintain the \nperfusate glucose in a defined range. Both hormones can be kept at a basal rate \nas defined by the user. The injection rate of insulin was in the range of 0.02 to \n4.5 IUh−1\n depending on perfusate glucose level. The glucagon was injected at rates \nof 0.02 to 0.5 IUh−1\n.\nBlood-gas analysis and control. By the use of an oxygenator (Medos Hilite 2400 LT) \nand three individual gas-flow controllers (Bronkhorst Schweiz) for oxygen, \nnitrogen and CO2, the partial oxygen pressure (pO2), partial CO2 pressure (pCO2) \nand pH of the blood were controlled. An online blood-gas sensor (Terumo CDI \n500 Shunt Sensor) continuously measured pO2, pCO2 and pH. A proportional \nintegral controller defined the oxygen concentration in the gas supply of the \noxygenator to maintain pO2 at the desired level (10–12 kPa). Another proportional \nintegral controller defined the total gas flow rate (oxygen and nitrogen) to control \nthe wash-out rate of pCO2 in the perfusate. With CO2 being present in its dissolved \nform as carbonic acid in the blood, the pCO2 level could be manipulated to \nvary pH in a certain range. The pCO2 was allowed to vary from 4.5 to 6.5 kPa to \nmaintain a target pH of around 7.4. With the inverse proportionality between \npCO2 and pH, an increasing pCO2 lead to a decrease in pH, that is, the blood \nbecame more acidic. Therefore, to reduce the pH, less pCO2 was washed out by \nreducing the total gas flow rate through the oxygenator, resulting in an increase \nof pCO2. The control was implemented by means of a control cascade with the \ninner control loop maintaining the secondary target pCO2 and the outer control \nloop maintaining the primary target pH of 7.4 by varying the pCO2 set point \nin the defined range of 4.5 to 6.5 kPa. CO2 was only supplied in the gas stream to \nthe oxygenator before starting the liver perfusion and in the initial phase until \nthe liver produced enough CO2 to maintain the target pCO2 in the blood. In the \nnormal perfusion phase, a surplus of CO2 is produced by the liver, requiring it \nto be washed out.\nPhysiologic oxygen saturation in portal vein. In the in vivo situation, the portal \nvein originates from the intestinal organs and, therefore, contains less oxygen as \ncompared to the hepatic artery. To mimic the physiologically reduced oxygen \nsaturation in the portal vein, venous blood from the reservoir was mixed with \na portion of arterial blood leaving the oxygenator. For this purpose, the pO2\nwas measured in the portal vein by means of an online blood-gas sensor (Shunt \nSensor, Terumo, CDI 500) as stated above. In addition, the system continuously \nmonitored the oxygen saturation in the vena cava (vSO2) using a saturation sensor \n(CDI H/S Cuvette, Terumo, CDI 500). To mimic the physiological venous oxygen \nsaturation in the portal vein, venous blood from the reservoir (blood from the vena \ncava with low, venous saturation) bypassed the oxygenator and was mixed with \na portion of the arterial blood from the oxygenator to achieve desired saturation \nlevels. The control was realized by means of a cascaded control. The inner control \nloop controlled the blood flow rate of the oxygenated blood (arterial blood) and \nthe ‘bypass flow rate’ by means of a continuous pinch valve. The outer control \nloop controlled the oxygen saturation of the vena cava by varying the set point of \nthe bypass flow rate. The goal was to keep a stable oxygenation level in the vena \ncava of 65% by varying the portal vein oxygen content. The total flow rate in the \nportal vein was maintained at 1 lmin−1\n. An increase of flow in the bypass was \nautomatically compensated to maintain a constant total flow rate in the portal vein.\nFeedback-controlled dialysis. A dialysis loop has been integrated into the perfusion \nsystem to supply and/or remove electrolytes, bicarbonates and metabolic waste \nproducts. By defining the TMF of fluid across the dialysis filter, dialysis was further \nutilized to control the blood hematocrit level by adding or removing fluid from the \nperfusion loop. A roller pump with multiple individual channels (Ismatec Reglo \nICC) controlled the inflow and outflow of dialysate to the dialysis filter (Ultraflux \nAV-Paed, Fresenius Medical Care), thereby allowing the system to define the TMF. \nThe targeted TMF was defined by the user or the controller of the system. Usually, \nthe TMF was in the range of −100mlh−1\n to 100mlh−1\n. By controlling the TMF, the \nsystem can vary the amount of blood plasma in the perfusate and, thus, control \nthe hematocrit level in perfusate. For this purpose, the control system used the \ncontinuous hematocrit measurement from the Terumo CDI 500 Cuvette sensor in \nthe vena cava line.\nPerfusate components and additives. The perfusate consisted of blood-group￾matched human red blood cells (approximately 1.4 l), fresh frozen plasma \n(approximately 0.8 l) and 1 unit of platelets from the human blood bank. A heparin \nbolus (5000U) was given at the start of perfusion. Albumin was added until it \nreached reference range (>2.0 g l\n−1\n). As soon as the tube set was primed with the \nperfusate, the dialysate (multiBIC, Fresenius Medical Care) flow rate to and from \nthe dialysis filter was set at a rate of 1,000–2,000mlh−1\n to correct electrolytes and \npH before connection of the liver to the perfusion system. The liver was connected \nto the system when sodium was in physiologic range and pH was around 7.2. \nBicarbonates (sodium hydrogen carbonate 8.4%, B. Braun Melsungen) were also \nused to correct pH at dialysis start if pH was below 7.0. During liver perfusion, the \ndialysate inflow rate to the dialysis filter was typically set to 200mlh−1\n. Dialysis \noutflow (leaving dialysis filter) rate was adjusted automatically by the control \nsystem depending on the measured hematocrit level. All the components of the \nperfusate are summarized in Supplementary Table 2.\nNature Biotechnology | www.nature.com/naturebiotechnology\n\nArticles Nature Biotechnology\nPig livers. The experiments were performed in accordance with the Swiss Animal \nProtection Law and Ordinance. Female land race pigs (around 90 kg) were \nobtained 1 week before surgery to allow acclimatization. The pigs were fasted \novernight before the experiment with free access to water. The pigs were sedated \nwith ketamine (Ketasol-100, 15mg kg−1\n), azaperon (Stresnil, 2mg kg−1\n) and \natropinsulfate (Atropin 1%, 0.05mg kg−1\n). General anesthesia was maintained with \nisoflurane (Attane, 1–2%) and propofol (Propofol Lipuro 1%, 3–5mg kg−1h−1\n). \nLaparotomy was performed under general anesthesia. The hepatic artery and \nportal vein were isolated for flow measurement with VeriQ (Medistim Germany \nGmbH) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. Flow in the hepatic \nartery was measured distal to the splenic artery and after ligating gastric branches. \nPhysiologic in vivo vascular flow rates in pigs for the hepatic artery and portal vein, \nmeasured at the time of organ procurement, were 0.25±0.07 lmin−1\n (n=5) and \n1.0±0.2 lmin−1\n (n=5), respectively. These values served therefore as a reference \nfor the ex vivo setting. Heparin (200 IUkg−1\n) was administered and the aorta \nwas cannulated. Pig livers and blood were procured in standardized fashion22. \nLivers were connected to the perfusion machine after back-table preparation \nof the vessels (hepatic artery, portal vein, vena cava and bile duct). The circuit \nwas primed with autologous, leukocyte-depleted pig blood (around 2.7 l) with \naddition of albumin (200ml, 20% solvent), bicarbonates (20ml), calcium gluconate \n(10ml), piperacillinum–tazobactamum (2.2 g) and methylprednisolon (500mg). \nThe perfusion technology was developed in a step-by-step approach with the \nfollowing stages as reported in the results section: glucose metabolism; minimizing \nhemolysis; electrolyte control; physiologic venous oxygen saturation in the portal \nvein; and liver movement. Pig livers were transplanted after ex vivo perfusion \naccording to a previously established protocol22.\nSampling. Blood samples were taken before the start of perfusion, every 15min \nduring the first hours of perfusion and hourly for the next 5h. Thereafter, blood \nsampling was performed daily. Tissue samples (liver biopsies) were collected before \nthe start of perfusion, after 3 and 6h of perfusion and afterward on a daily basis. \nBile was sampled daily.\nMeasurements. Perfusate. Blood-gas analysis from arterial (hepatic artery), portal \n(portal vein) and caval (vena cava) lines was performed using the Radiometer \nABL90 FLEX. The blood-gas analysis data were used to calibrate the glucose \nsensor and the online sensors of the Terumo, CDI 500 device. A Piccolo Xpress \nanalyzer (Abaxis) was used for the quantitative determination of BUN, albumin, \nalanine aminotransferase (ALT), AST, total bilirubin, gamma glutamyltransferase \nand alkaline phosphatase using the Piccolo general chemistry 13 panel (Abaxis). \nAmmonia levels were determined with the PocketChem BA (PA-4140, Arkray). \nFactor V was measured by the clinical laboratory of the University Hospital Zurich.\nPlasma from perfusate. Plasma samples were obtained from the blood-based \nperfusate by centrifugation using standard protocol and snap frozen in liquid \nnitrogen for further analysis (long-term preservation at −80 °C). Free hemoglobin \nwas measured spectrometrically assay using Drabkin solution (D5941, Sigma). \nThe cytokine levels in the plasma were analyzed using LEGENDplex Human \nInflammation Panel (740118, Biolegend). Fifty microliters of plasma were assayed \nfollowing the manufacturer’s instruction. In human livers 7 to 10, the upper \nmeasurable limit of the analytical method was taken for statistical analysis, because \nthis value was exceeded. 8-Oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine (KA0444, Abnova) for DNA \ndamage and cytochrome C (CSB-EL006328PI, Cusabio) for mitochondrial injury \nwere measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the \nmanufacturer’s recommendation.\nTissue. Tissue biopsies were taken at different time points and positions before \nand during perfusion using standard protocols, and either stored in formalin for \nhistological analysis or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for \nfurther analysis.\nHistology. The following staining procedures were performed on random 3-µm￾thick paraffin-embedded liver sections: hematoxylin and eosin, cleaved caspase 3 \n(9661S, Cell Signaling) staining as an apoptosis marker, von Willebrand Factor \n(IR527, DAKO) for endothelial cell activation, Ki-67 staining as a proliferation \nmarker in bile ducts (IR626, DAKO), pH3 staining as a mitosis marker (M-06-\n570-3KL, Milipore), CD68 staining for liver macrophages (M0876, DAKO) and \ncytokeratin 7 staining for bile ducts (DAKO). PAS staining was performed for \nqualitative analysis of glycogen content.\nFrozen tissue. Total RNA was extracted from 10mg of liver tissue using RNeasy \nMini kit (Qiagen) including a DNAse I digestion step (RNase-free DNase set, \nQuiagen) on column. The purified RNA was transcribed to cDNA using the \nqScript cDNA SuperMix reagent (VWR). TaqMan gene-expression assays and \nan 18S rRNA internal control (TaqMan ribosomal RNA control reagents) were \nfrom PE Applied Biosystems. Sequence amplification and data analysis were \nperformed on the ABI Prism 7500 Sequence Detector system (PE Applied \nBiosystems). Taqman gene-expression assays used were Ss03384604_u1 for \nporcine IL6, Ss03382372_u1 for porcine IL10, Ss03392385_m1 for porcine ICAM1, \nHs00164932_m1 for human ICAM1 and 4308329 for 18S rRNA. The expression \nvalues were normalized to the sample at the perfusion start. Intrahepatic glycogen \ncontent was determined using the Glycogen Assay kit (MAK016, Sigma) following \nthe manufacturer’s instructions. Total protein was extracted from tissue (10mg) in \nRIPA buffer using the standard protocol. Protein quantification and immunoblots \nwere performed using Biorad protocols and systems, and the antibodies used were \nphospho-Akt (S472) (9271S, Cell Signaling), α-tubulin (2125S, Cell Signaling), \nphospho-GSK3β (S9) (5558S, Cell Signaling) and GSK3β (12456S, Cell Signaling). \nMitochondrial function was analyzed by liver ATP content using ENLITEN \nrLuciferase/Luciferin Reagent (FF2021, Promega). In brief, the frozen tissue \n(10mg) was homogenized in 1.0ml of ice‐cold TBS buffer and deproteinized using \na TCA kit (ab204708, Abcam). One hundred microliters of diluted supernatant \nwere assayed by addition of 50μl of ATP monitoring reagent. Luminiscence \nkinetics of samples and ATP standards (Sigma) were measured using a Citation 3 \nimaging reader (Biotek). ATP concentrations were extrapolated from the reading of \nthe kinetic showing better regression of the calibration curve and normalized with \nthe protein content in the samples before deproteinization.\nBile. DRI-CHEM 4000i (Fujifilm) was used for quantitative determination of total \nbilirubin. Bile glucose was measured using a Radiometer ABL90 FLEX device.\nStatistics. Data collection and graphs were performed with Matlab R2017a \n(MathWorks). The data from different experiments were bundled at the same \ntime points. Data points were bundled to a set when at least two data points of \nindividual experiments were available. Then, the mean and s.d. of the bundled \ndata points was calculated. Owing to logistical reasons, the daily sampling of the \nvarious experiments could not be conducted at exactly the same times, therefore \nthey were also bundled over a time period of a ±9h. For comparison of two \ngroups, two-tailed Student’s t test was used. Data were reported as mean±s.d. \nP<0.05 was considered as significant. Exact sample size (n) for each experimental \ngroup and units of measurement were provided in the text and figure captions. No \nassumptions or corrections were applied in statistical analysis. Further details on \nstatistics are available online in the Reporting Summary.\nReporting Summary.
