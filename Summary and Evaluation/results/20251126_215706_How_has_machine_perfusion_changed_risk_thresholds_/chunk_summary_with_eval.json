    "summary": "This research aims to investigate the evolution of dynamic, biochemical, and morphological parameters during hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) of human livers using discarded livers. The study includes two stages: in the first stage, 25 livers were randomly assigned to static cold storage, arterial HMP, or non-oxygenated portal vein HMP. In the second stage, 20 livers were randomly assigned to oxygenated or non-oxygenated portal vein HMP. The study found that resistance was higher and flow was lower during arterial perfusion than venous perfusion, leading to higher perfusate markers during arterial perfusion. Oxygen supplementation did not significantly affect the studied parameters. Morphology was similar between static and dynamic preservation groups. Perfusate markers were twice as high in non-transplantable livers compared to potentially transplantable livers. Overall, the study provides insights into the effects of different perfusion routes and oxygenation on perfusion biomarkers during HMP.",

Machine Perfusion: Future Preservation Method\nConclusions: Machine perfusion is superior to CS on improving short-term outcomes\nfor human liver transplantation, with a less clear effect in the longer term. Hypothermic\nmachine perfusion but not NMP conducted significantly protective effects on EAD\nand biliary complications. Further RCTs are warranted to confirm MP’s superiority\nand applications.\nKeywords: machine perfusion, static cold storage, graft preservation, liver transplantation, meta-analysis\nINTRODUCTION\nLiver transplantation (LT) has been the optimal treatment\nfor patients with end-stage liver disease. Rapidly increasing\ndemands for LT have also caused severe shortage of donor liver\norgans in clinical application. To overcome this discrepancy,\ndonation after circulatory death (DCD), extended criteria donors\n(ECDs), living liver donation, or marginal liver grafts are\nincreasingly accepted to expand the limited donor pool. However,\nstudies have suggested that these additional liver donation\nsources often suffered from longer warm ischemic periods and\nworse ischemia–reperfusion injury (IRI) during LT, resulting\nin increased risk of early allograft dysfunction (EAD), primary\nnonfunction (PNF), biliary complications, and poorer long-term\ngraft and patient survival (1).\nDuring transplantation, the quality of donor liver preservation\nis an important factor on maintaining and improving transplant\noutcomes of patients. Standard static cold storage (CS)\nremains the gold standard method for liver graft preservation.\nNevertheless, the effectiveness of CS preservation is currently\nunable to provide sufficient protection of liver grafts against IRI,\nespecially for prolonged CS of DCD and marginal livers, often\nresulting in increased risk of EAD, PNF, and biliary complications\n(2). As an alternative preservation strategy, machine perfusion\n(MP) can provide a continuous circulation of metabolic\nsubstrates and antioxidants, imitating the physiological processes\nwhile flushing inflammatory cytokine and toxins from the graft.\nTherefore, MP has been proposed as a better strategy to protect or\nrescue marginal liver grafts by attenuating the cytokine mediated\nIRI (3).\nMachine perfusion has been widely used for preservation\nin kidney transplantation. Plenty of evidence suggested MP’s\npriority in improving early graft function, reducing the risk of\ndelayed graft function (DGF), and enhancing ECD graft survival\nafter renal transplantation (4). Unlike kidney transplantation,\nMP remained relatively limited in clinical LTs due to the high\nmetabolism rates of liver, relatively complicated perfusion system\nAbbreviations: AST, aspartate aminotransferase; ALT, alanine transaminase; CI,\nconfidence interval; CS, cold storage; DBD, deceased brain donor; DCD, donor\nafter cardiac death; EAD, early allograft dysfunction; ECD, extended criteria\ndonors; HAT, hepatic artery thrombosis; HMP, hypothermic machine perfusion;\nHOPE, hypothermic oxygenated perfusion; IRI, ischemia–reperfusion injury; IC,\nischemic cholangiopathy; LT, liver transplantation; MP, machine perfusion; MELD,\nmodel for end-stage liver disease; NOS, Newcastle–Ottawa Quality Assessment\nScale; NMP, normothermic machine perfusion; OR:odds ratio; PNF, primary\nnonfunction; PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta￾Analysis.\nconsisting of hepatic and portal route, poor practicality, and\nhigh costs.\nLarge animal and human experimental studies have suggested\nthat MP may provide better protection of liver grafts against\nIRI than CS (5, 6).

These organs are known to function poorly if\ntransplanted but make up a significant portion of the available pool of donated livers. This\nstudy demonstrates the ability to improve the function of steatotic rat livers using a combina￾tion of ex situ machine perfusion and a “defatting” drug cocktail. After 6 hours of perfusion,\ndefatted livers demonstrated lower perfusate lactate levels and improved bile quality as\ndemonstrated by higher bile bicarbonate and lower bile lactate. Furthermore, defatting was\nassociated with decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased\nexpression of enzymes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Rehabilitation of mar￾ginal or discarded steatotic livers using machine perfusion and tailored drug therapy can sig￾nificantly increase the supply of donor livers for transplantation.\nIntroduction\nLiver transplantation remains the only cure for end-stage liver disease. However, there contin￾ues to be a significant organ shortage with approximately 14, 000 patients on the waitlist and\n8,000 liver transplants performed annually [1]. Central to the donor organ shortage is the high\ndiscard rate of procured or potentially procurable organs, with nearly 3,000 livers discarded\nper year [2]. As a result of the obesity epidemic in the United States and Europe, nearly half of\nprocured livers are discarded due to excessive macrosteatosis related to non-alcoholic fatty\nliver disease (NAFLD) [3].\nPLOS ONE\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0232886 May 12, 2020 1 / 19\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Raigani S, Carroll C, Griffith S, Pendexter\nC, Rosales I, Deirawan H, et al.

            "text": "Steatotic livers are particularly prone to ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI)[4]. As a result,\ntransplantation of livers with moderate (30–60%) or severe (>60%) macrosteatosis is associ￾ated with increased early allograft dysfunction (EAD) or primary non-function, and decreased\nlong-term graft survival [5, 6]. Further contributing to IRI is acute-on-chronic oxidative stress,\ncompromised hepatic microcirculation, and an inability to recover from an energy-depleted\nstate [7–10].\nThe application of ex situ machine perfusion technology to liver resuscitation and rehabili￾tation has not only decreased the organ discard rate, but expanded the ability to use marginal,\nextended criteria, or even discarded livers for transplantation without compromising patient\nand graft survival [11, 12]. Using machine perfusion as a platform for targeted intervention\npaves the way for salvage of otherwise discarded organs for potential transplantation. One\napplication of this technology involves salvaging steatotic livers. Over 10 year ago, our group\nreported for the first time in the literature a combination of agents capable of “defatting” and\nreversing key biochemical deficiencies in steatotic hepatocytes in culture [13–15]. Boteon and\ncolleagues recently showed that the same cocktail decreases fat content and improves perfu￾sion parameters in discarded steatotic human livers [16]. However, the safety and utility of sev￾eral components of the cocktail have not been confirmed or have been abandoned for human\nclinical use [17]. We therefore performed a mechanistic study in a rat liver perfusion model to\nidentify pathways targeted by these agents, with the ultimate goal of replacing them with agents\ndeveloped in the interim 10 years that are safe for human clinical use.\nMethods\nPreparation of perfusate\nBaseline (plain) perfusate consisted of high-glucose Dulbecco’s Minimum Eagles’ Medium\nsupplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum, 2% v/v penicillin-streptomycin, and 3% w/v\nbovine serum albumin. The original development of the defatting cocktail in vitro [13, 14] and\nits subsequent cytotoxicity testing in cell culture models [15] have been previously described.\nDefatting cocktail agents include 10 uM forskolin, 1uM GW7647, 1uM GW501516, 10 uM\nscoparone, 10 uM hypericin, 0.4 ng/ml visfatin, 0.8 mM L-carnitine, and additional amino\nacids [13, 14]. Defatting perfusate consisted of plain perfusate supplemented with defatting\ncocktail. Perfusate and cocktail component details are provided in the Supplemental Methods\nin S1 File.\nIsolated liver perfusion\nLean (Fa/fa) and obese (fa/fa) male Zucker rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA)\naged 12–16 weeks and group housed in pairs in a conventional room under standard condi￾tions (21ºC room temperature, 12-hour light/dark cycles, mixed paper/cellulose bedding).\nRats had free access to standard chow and autoclaved water.

After induction of anesthesia with\n3–5% isoflurane, a transverse laparotomy was made. The common bile duct was partially tran￾sected, cannulated with 28-gauge PTFE tubing, and secured with 4–0 silk sutures. 0.3 mL of\n1000U/mL heparin was injected into the inferior vena cava (IVC) and after 3 minutes of circu￾lation, the hepatic artery was ligated with 7–0 silk. Next, the portal vein was cannulated with a\n16-gauge catheter, followed immediately by transection of the IVC. The liver was then flushed\nslowly with 50 mL of ice-cold 0.9% saline via the portal cannula while the rat was simulta￾neously euthanized by exsanguination under isoflurane gas anesthesia.

There were 126 livers suitable for the\ntrial, with steatosis being the leading cause of organ discard with 78 (42%) offers. Stringent donor inclusion criteria were not met in 25 (14%) offers and on\n21 (11%) occasions the research team was already committed to the perfusion of another study liver. A liver was considered for the trial only if it could be\nallocated to a consented, potential blood group- and size-matched low-risk recipient. Many recipients were apprehensive to participate in such a high-risk\nclinical trial, and as a consequence, at any given time there were usually only one to three patients consented. A significant proportion of approached\npatients declined to take part, or were transplanted with a standard quality liver before agreeing to take part in this study. Eventually, thirty-one livers were\nenroled to the trial, of which 22 (71%) grafts met the viability criteria and were successfully transplanted. b A summary of reasons for livers being\ndiscarded in the United Kingdom between November 2016 and February 2018. A total of 64 livers were discarded for severe steatosis on visual\nassessment, with 14 discarded for severe steatosis based on urgent liver biopsy.

However, our data ap￾pear clinically plausible and concur with description of\nhemodynamic recovery after PRS by other authors [17].\nIn this study, multivariable regression modelling identi￾fied one donor related and one recipient related predictor\nof PRS: graft quality – visually assessed by the transplanting\nsurgeon – and cumulative intraoperative norepinephrine\ndosage before reperfusion of the liver graft. The variety of\nrisk factors and risk prediction models described in differ￾ent studies suggests that PRS may occur in an unpredict￾able manner or may be highly subjective to center-specific\neffects [8, 13–20, 22]. The most frequent reported risk fac￾tors for PRS are longer CIT [15, 16, 18, 20] and intraopera￾tive hemodynamics prior to reperfusion [14, 15, 17, 20],\nfollowed by graft steatosis [8, 16], operation time and tech￾nique [15, 18], severity of recipient’s liver disease [8, 19],\nand donor age [13, 17]. One single center study retrospect￾ive analysis was unable to identify even a single risk factor\nin a retrospective analysis of a sample of 261 LT\nrecipients [37]. Our findings that graft quality and hemo￾dymic impairment prior to reperfusion are risk factors for\nPRS concur with several similar studies. However, it re￾mains cryptic why the multitude of these observational\nstudies generate such a diversity of findings when it comes\nto predicting postreperfusion syndrome. Prospective multi￾center trials, the creation of an LT register or meta-analyses\ninvestigating the prediction of PRS could help to shed light\non this matter in the future.\nThe increasing number of liver transplantations has led\nto an increased demand of donor organs [1] and to the\ngrowing use of organs from extended criteria donors (ECD)\n[23]. A common quality marker for organs is fatty change,\nor steatosis. Steatosis has indeed been linked to the occur￾rence of PRS [8, 16]. Studies have shown that transplant￾ation of liver grafts with moderate to severe steatosis can\nvery well be conducted without sacrificing recipient survival\nbut in particular, that increased efforts are needed when\ndealing with these organs [26, 38]. However, macroscopic\nassessment of the organ may not be qualified to assess\nsteatosis: Rey and colleagues have examined 36 livers of\norgan donors which were explanted but not allocated.\nFig. 3 Clinical chemistry.

Machine Perfusion: Future Preservation Method\nConclusions: Machine perfusion is superior to CS on improving short-term outcomes\nfor human liver transplantation, with a less clear effect in the longer term. Hypothermic\nmachine perfusion but not NMP conducted significantly protective effects on EAD\nand biliary complications. Further RCTs are warranted to confirm MP’s superiority\nand applications.\nKeywords: machine perfusion, static cold storage, graft preservation, liver transplantation, meta-analysis\nINTRODUCTION\nLiver transplantation (LT) has been the optimal treatment\nfor patients with end-stage liver disease. Rapidly increasing\ndemands for LT have also caused severe shortage of donor liver\norgans in clinical application. To overcome this discrepancy,\ndonation after circulatory death (DCD), extended criteria donors\n(ECDs), living liver donation, or marginal liver grafts are\nincreasingly accepted to expand the limited donor pool. However,\nstudies have suggested that these additional liver donation\nsources often suffered from longer warm ischemic periods and\nworse ischemia–reperfusion injury (IRI) during LT, resulting\nin increased risk of early allograft dysfunction (EAD), primary\nnonfunction (PNF), biliary complications, and poorer long-term\ngraft and patient survival (1).\nDuring transplantation, the quality of donor liver preservation\nis an important factor on maintaining and improving transplant\noutcomes of patients. Standard static cold storage (CS)\nremains the gold standard method for liver graft preservation.\nNevertheless, the effectiveness of CS preservation is currently\nunable to provide sufficient protection of liver grafts against IRI,\nespecially for prolonged CS of DCD and marginal livers, often\nresulting in increased risk of EAD, PNF, and biliary complications\n(2). As an alternative preservation strategy, machine perfusion\n(MP) can provide a continuous circulation of metabolic\nsubstrates and antioxidants, imitating the physiological processes\nwhile flushing inflammatory cytokine and toxins from the graft.\nTherefore, MP has been proposed as a better strategy to protect or\nrescue marginal liver grafts by attenuating the cytokine mediated\nIRI (3).\nMachine perfusion has been widely used for preservation\nin kidney transplantation. Plenty of evidence suggested MP’s\npriority in improving early graft function, reducing the risk of\ndelayed graft function (DGF), and enhancing ECD graft survival\nafter renal transplantation (4). Unlike kidney transplantation,\nMP remained relatively limited in clinical LTs due to the high\nmetabolism rates of liver, relatively complicated perfusion system\nAbbreviations: AST, aspartate aminotransferase; ALT, alanine transaminase; CI,\nconfidence interval; CS, cold storage; DBD, deceased brain donor; DCD, donor\nafter cardiac death; EAD, early allograft dysfunction; ECD, extended criteria\ndonors; HAT, hepatic artery thrombosis; HMP, hypothermic machine perfusion;\nHOPE, hypothermic oxygenated perfusion; IRI, ischemia–reperfusion injury; IC,\nischemic cholangiopathy; LT, liver transplantation; MP, machine perfusion; MELD,\nmodel for end-stage liver disease; NOS, Newcastle–Ottawa Quality Assessment\nScale; NMP, normothermic machine perfusion; OR:odds ratio; PNF, primary\nnonfunction; PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta￾Analysis.\nconsisting of hepatic and portal route, poor practicality, and\nhigh costs.\nLarge animal and human experimental studies have suggested\nthat MP may provide better protection of liver grafts against\nIRI than CS (5, 6).

These organs are known to function poorly if\ntransplanted but make up a significant portion of the available pool of donated livers. This\nstudy demonstrates the ability to improve the function of steatotic rat livers using a combina￾tion of ex situ machine perfusion and a “defatting” drug cocktail. After 6 hours of perfusion,\ndefatted livers demonstrated lower perfusate lactate levels and improved bile quality as\ndemonstrated by higher bile bicarbonate and lower bile lactate. Furthermore, defatting was\nassociated with decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased\nexpression of enzymes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Rehabilitation of mar￾ginal or discarded steatotic livers using machine perfusion and tailored drug therapy can sig￾nificantly increase the supply of donor livers for transplantation.\nIntroduction\nLiver transplantation remains the only cure for end-stage liver disease. However, there contin￾ues to be a significant organ shortage with approximately 14, 000 patients on the waitlist and\n8,000 liver transplants performed annually [1]. Central to the donor organ shortage is the high\ndiscard rate of procured or potentially procurable organs, with nearly 3,000 livers discarded\nper year [2]. As a result of the obesity epidemic in the United States and Europe, nearly half of\nprocured livers are discarded due to excessive macrosteatosis related to non-alcoholic fatty\nliver disease (NAFLD) [3].\nPLOS ONE\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0232886 May 12, 2020 1 / 19\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Raigani S, Carroll C, Griffith S, Pendexter\nC, Rosales I, Deirawan H, et al.

        "Steatotic livers are particularly prone to ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI)[4]. As a result,\ntransplantation of livers with moderate (30–60%) or severe (>60%) macrosteatosis is associ￾ated with increased early allograft dysfunction (EAD) or primary non-function, and decreased\nlong-term graft survival [5, 6]. Further contributing to IRI is acute-on-chronic oxidative stress,\ncompromised hepatic microcirculation, and an inability to recover from an energy-depleted\nstate [7–10].\nThe application of ex situ machine perfusion technology to liver resuscitation and rehabili￾tation has not only decreased the organ discard rate, but expanded the ability to use marginal,\nextended criteria, or even discarded livers for transplantation without compromising patient\nand graft survival [11, 12]. Using machine perfusion as a platform for targeted intervention\npaves the way for salvage of otherwise discarded organs for potential transplantation. One\napplication of this technology involves salvaging steatotic livers. Over 10 year ago, our group\nreported for the first time in the literature a combination of agents capable of “defatting” and\nreversing key biochemical deficiencies in steatotic hepatocytes in culture [13–15]. Boteon and\ncolleagues recently showed that the same cocktail decreases fat content and improves perfu￾sion parameters in discarded steatotic human livers [16]. However, the safety and utility of sev￾eral components of the cocktail have not been confirmed or have been abandoned for human\nclinical use [17]. We therefore performed a mechanistic study in a rat liver perfusion model to\nidentify pathways targeted by these agents, with the ultimate goal of replacing them with agents\ndeveloped in the interim 10 years that are safe for human clinical use.\nMethods\nPreparation of perfusate\nBaseline (plain) perfusate consisted of high-glucose Dulbecco’s Minimum Eagles’ Medium\nsupplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum, 2% v/v penicillin-streptomycin, and 3% w/v\nbovine serum albumin. The original development of the defatting cocktail in vitro [13, 14] and\nits subsequent cytotoxicity testing in cell culture models [15] have been previously described.\nDefatting cocktail agents include 10 uM forskolin, 1uM GW7647, 1uM GW501516, 10 uM\nscoparone, 10 uM hypericin, 0.4 ng/ml visfatin, 0.8 mM L-carnitine, and additional amino\nacids [13, 14]. Defatting perfusate consisted of plain perfusate supplemented with defatting\ncocktail. Perfusate and cocktail component details are provided in the Supplemental Methods\nin S1 File.\nIsolated liver perfusion\nLean (Fa/fa) and obese (fa/fa) male Zucker rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA)\naged 12–16 weeks and group housed in pairs in a conventional room under standard condi￾tions (21ºC room temperature, 12-hour light/dark cycles, mixed paper/cellulose bedding).\nRats had free access to standard chow and autoclaved water. Animal studies were approved by\nthe institutional animal use and care committee of the Massachusetts General Hospital and\nShriners Hospital for Children and comply with the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Ani￾mals as outlined by the National Academy of Sciences. After induction of anesthesia with\n3–5% isoflurane, a transverse laparotomy was made. The common bile duct was partially tran￾sected, cannulated with 28-gauge PTFE tubing, and secured with 4–0 silk sutures. 0.3 mL of\n1000U/mL heparin was injected into the inferior vena cava (IVC) and after 3 minutes of circu￾lation, the hepatic artery was ligated with 7–0 silk. Next, the portal vein was cannulated with a\n16-gauge catheter, followed immediately by transection of the IVC. The liver was then flushed\nslowly with 50 mL of ice-cold 0.9% saline via the portal cannula while the rat was simulta￾neously euthanized by exsanguination under isoflurane gas anesthesia.

        "16-month study period there were 185 discarded liver research offers, of which 59 (32%) were not eligible for the trial due to an incidental finding of\ncancer, macroscopically apparent cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis, severe organ damage or previous machine perfusion. There were 126 livers suitable for the\ntrial, with steatosis being the leading cause of organ discard with 78 (42%) offers. Stringent donor inclusion criteria were not met in 25 (14%) offers and on\n21 (11%) occasions the research team was already committed to the perfusion of another study liver. A liver was considered for the trial only if it could be\nallocated to a consented, potential blood group- and size-matched low-risk recipient. Many recipients were apprehensive to participate in such a high-risk\nclinical trial, and as a consequence, at any given time there were usually only one to three patients consented. A significant proportion of approached\npatients declined to take part, or were transplanted with a standard quality liver before agreeing to take part in this study. Eventually, thirty-one livers were\nenroled to the trial, of which 22 (71%) grafts met the viability criteria and were successfully transplanted. b A summary of reasons for livers being\ndiscarded in the United Kingdom between November 2016 and February 2018. A total of 64 livers were discarded for severe steatosis on visual\nassessment, with 14 discarded for severe steatosis based on urgent liver biopsy. A percentage of livers were declined due to intra-abdominal or lung\nmalignancies (e.g. colonic cancer in donor 22). This did not include primary brain tumours or small renal cell cancers which are almost always considered\nfor donation. The reasons for logistic discard, include the transplant team already being committed to one or more transplantations, lack of a suitable\nrecipient or too long an anticipated cold ischaemia time due to delays with transportation.\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16251-3 ARTICLE\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2020) 11:2939 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16251-3 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 3",

        "infusion after reperfusion as additional criteria for PRS.\nThis altered definition impedes comparability with other\nstudies and may overestimate PRS incidence compared to\nthe commonly used definition. However, our data ap￾pear clinically plausible and concur with description of\nhemodynamic recovery after PRS by other authors [17].\nIn this study, multivariable regression modelling identi￾fied one donor related and one recipient related predictor\nof PRS: graft quality – visually assessed by the transplanting\nsurgeon – and cumulative intraoperative norepinephrine\ndosage before reperfusion of the liver graft. The variety of\nrisk factors and risk prediction models described in differ￾ent studies suggests that PRS may occur in an unpredict￾able manner or may be highly subjective to center-specific\neffects [8, 13–20, 22]. The most frequent reported risk fac￾tors for PRS are longer CIT [15, 16, 18, 20] and intraopera￾tive hemodynamics prior to reperfusion [14, 15, 17, 20],\nfollowed by graft steatosis [8, 16], operation time and tech￾nique [15, 18], severity of recipient’s liver disease [8, 19],\nand donor age [13, 17]. One single center study retrospect￾ive analysis was unable to identify even a single risk factor\nin a retrospective analysis of a sample of 261 LT\nrecipients [37]. Our findings that graft quality and hemo￾dymic impairment prior to reperfusion are risk factors for\nPRS concur with several similar studies. However, it re￾mains cryptic why the multitude of these observational\nstudies generate such a diversity of findings when it comes\nto predicting postreperfusion syndrome. Prospective multi￾center trials, the creation of an LT register or meta-analyses\ninvestigating the prediction of PRS could help to shed light\non this matter in the future.\nThe increasing number of liver transplantations has led\nto an increased demand of donor organs [1] and to the\ngrowing use of organs from extended criteria donors (ECD)\n[23]. A common quality marker for organs is fatty change,\nor steatosis. Steatosis has indeed been linked to the occur￾rence of PRS [8, 16]. Studies have shown that transplant￾ation of liver grafts with moderate to severe steatosis can\nvery well be conducted without sacrificing recipient survival\nbut in particular, that increased efforts are needed when\ndealing with these organs [26, 38]. However, macroscopic\nassessment of the organ may not be qualified to assess\nsteatosis: Rey and colleagues have examined 36 livers of\norgan donors which were explanted but not allocated.\nFig. 3 Clinical chemistry. Postoperative clinical chemistry of 122 liver transplant (LT) recipients, 65 with postreperfusion syndrome (PRS, black\ncircles), 57 without postoperative PRS (white circles). LT recipients with PRS suffered from greater postoperative transplant damage and poorer\ntransplant function during the postoperative course: Aspartat transferase blood concentration was higher (a) and blood hemostasis was poorer\n(d) compared to LT recipients without postreperfusion syndrome (alanine transferase was higher but did not reach significance, (b) LT recipients\nwith and without PRS did not differ in gall retention (c). Inflammation marker procalcitonin (e) and kidney function marker creatinine (f) were\npeaking higher during the postoperative course in LT recipients with PRS compared to recipients without PRS but did not reach statistical\nsignificance.

The study included 2 stages: in the first stage, 25 livers were ran￾domised into static cold storage (n = 7), hepatic artery HMP (n = 10), and non-oxygen￾supplemented portal vein HMP (n = 8). In the second stage, 20 livers were randomised into\noxygen-supplemented and non-oxygen-supplemented portal vein HMP (n = 11 and 9,\nrespectively). Changes in dynamic, biochemical, and morphologic parameters during 4-\nhour preservation were compared between perfusion groups, and between potentially trans￾plantable and non-transplantable livers.\nResults\nDuring arterial perfusion, resistance was higher and flow was lower than venous perfusion\n(p = 0.001 and 0.01, respectively); this was associated with higher perfusate markers\nduring arterial perfusion (p>0.05). Supplementary oxygen did not cause a significant alter￾ation in the studied parameters. Morphology was similar between static and dynamic\npreservation groups. Perfusate markers were 2 fold higher in non-transplantable livers\n(p>0.05).\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0203803 September 14, 2018 1 / 12\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Abudhaise H, Davidson BR, DeMuylder P,\nLuong TV, Fuller B (2018) Evolution of dynamic,\nbiochemical, and morphological parameters in\nhypothermic machine perfusion of human livers: A\nproof-of-concept study.
