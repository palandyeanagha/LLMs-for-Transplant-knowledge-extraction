The impact of\nhyperuricemia on RTRs was dependent on the duration of\nexposure. Likewise, the detrimental effect of early-onset hyperuri￾cemia on the graft function was dependent on UA-level and\nexposure time. After control of the baseline graft function by\nanalysis of only recipients with a good graft function at 1 year post￾transplantation (eGFR . 60 ml/min), moderate-to-severe early￾onset hyperuricemia was also a marker of long-term graft\ndysfunction and failure [24]. Haririan et al found that higher\nUA level had significant higher risk of graft loss compared to lower\nUA level. Each 1 mg/dL increase of UA level was associated with\na 15% increase on average in the risk of graft loss during the study\nperiod and seemed to be associated with increased risk of death\n[26]. These two studies suggested that both higher UA-level and\nlonger duration of exposure have severe impacts on graft function.\nAdvantages and Limitations\nThis meta-analysis has some advantages. First, the samples of\nincluded cohort studies came from Korea, China, Canada,\nPoland, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, USA and German that would\nhave a good representative of race. Second, the effect of\nHyperuricemia on renal function is consistent regardless of\nwhether other confounding factors were adjusted or not. Third,\nthe included studies have moderate to high quality and good\ninternal validity.\nLimitations of this study should be noted. First, the included\nstudies had potential risk of bias due to differences in complete\nreporting of follow-up and judgment of outcomes. Second,\nalthough included study adjusted confounding factors relevant to\nrenal function more or less, the number and types of adjusted\nfactors were different. There are maybe residual confounding\nfactors which have effects on outcomes. However, the pooled\nestimates found that no matter confounding factors adjusted or un￾adjusted, no matter how many confounding factors were adjusted,\nthe conclusion that hyperuricemia is a risk factor of graft\ndysfunction and poor prognosis is consistent. Third, as the sample\nFigure 5.

Limitations of this review\nFirstly, the number of RCTs that investigated treatment strategies in\nthe donor and their impact on graft function and survival after trans￾plantation is limited. Furthermore, as our search strategy focused on\ndonor treatment only, potentially promising treatment strategies of\nthe graft after procurement and during preservation were excluded\nthat may be of a pre-transplant treatment potential. In addition, several\nstudies we did include were performed with a low number of partici￾pants, did not report power calculations or were underpowered to de￾tect changes in the outcome parameters as stipulated in this review.\nConsequentially, potential effects on organ function or survival might\nhave been missed and interpretation of the data from these studies\nshould be done with caution. Furthermore, we acknowledge that\nsome outcome parameters, such as plasma bilirubin to assess liver func￾tion or number of organs transplanted in the case of the kidney, are pos￾sibly weakly correlated to organ injury. However, as these endpoints\nwere assessed in conjunction with other biomarkers, the prognostic\nvalue of these endpoints is strengthened. The few number of studies\nalso limited us from assessing the risk of publication bias or perform\nsubgroup analyses. Therefore, drawing conclusions from these studies\nis risky, particularly when grouping for meta-analyses was not possible.\nAdditionally, we found limited studies on lung transplantation, and no\nstudies on pancreas or intestinal transplantations. Lastly, we realise\nthat several promising treatment strategies published in relevant ani￾mal models are not included in this article. However, we believe that\nthese studies were outside the scope of this review as interpretation\nof these results are not yet influential in clinical decision making in de￾ceased donor care.\n5. Conclusions\nThe current global shortage of suitable donor organs and often un￾certainty which organ to accept or decline, underlines the need for op￾timisation of deceased donor care. Treatment strategies aim at\nreducing the detrimental effects of haemodynamic, hormonal, inflam￾matory, and metabolic disturbances prior to organ retrieval. Better con￾ditioning of the grafts-to-be and reducing, or even preventing, donor￾related injury prior to preservation and transplantation have become\nimportant goals to transplant higher risk donor organs, without\ncompromising outcomes after transplantation. Unfortunately, current\ndonor management protocols may vary considerably per centre and\nare based on low-level evidence. In this systematic review, we could\nnot find consistent evidence supporting that any individual treatment\nthat has been tested until now will protect donor organs or improve sur￾vival after transplantation. More organised and defined RCTs are re￾quired to identify and validate possible benefits of innovative\ntreatments before clinical implementation can be recommended as\npart of standard donor care. We feel that a concerted action between\nprofessionals in Intensive Care and organ transplantation is needed to\ngain better insight and stimulate clinically relevant interventions in\nDBD donors.\nAuthors' contributions\nAE and LD both performed the initial search, selection and assess￾ment of the articles, and wrote the manuscript.

HMP resulted in a significantly\nreduced DGF rate as well as better early graft function after\n1 month compared to SCS. However, 1-year graft survival was\ncomparable in both groups (49).\nFurthermore, in another RCT, kidneys were either preserved\nby HMP or SCS. In accordance with Moers as well as\nJochmans, the primary end-point was the occurrence of DGF.\nSecondary endpoints were primary non-function as well as graft\nsurvival. Both the risk of DGF and the incidence of non￾function were significantly reduced by HMP in their cohort.\nOne-year graft survival and function could be improved by\ndynamic cold graft preservation (52). Despite these findings,\nthe importance of different factors such as the impact of CIT\nand the combination of CIT with HMP have to be mentioned.\nCIT is a known independent risk factor for DGF. In order\nto investigate which kidney graft may further benefit from\nHMP prior to transplantation, Kox et al. analyzed prospectively\ncollected data from the “Machine Perfusion Trial.” A total of 752\nrenal transplants were included with 376 dynamically preserved\nkidneys and 376 statically preserved grafts. They identified CIT\nas an independent risk factor for DGF. Furthermore, HMP did\nnot prevent DGF if CIT exceeded 10 h (51).\nThe optimal timepoint for, as well as the optimal duration of,\nHMP is still a matter of debate. HMP can be used either as a\nprimary preservation method or in the end-ischemic phase as\na reconditioning tool. Matos et al. were able to show a faster\nrecovery of renal function if grafts were subjected to HMP prior\nto transplantation after a mean SCS period of 22 h. MP time was\nat least 6 h. However, this beneficial effect was limited to donors\nunder the age of 50, who represent a rather selective group (94).\nFurther studies followed, indicating a beneficial effect of MP in\nthe end-ischemic phase by displaying a reduction of DGF, as\nwell as an improved organ acceptance. This last positive trend is\nattributed mainly to the possibility of organ monitoring (95, 96).\nNMP of the Kidney\nNMP of the kidney may eventually resolve many issues\nrelated to damage induced by ischemic phases. The idea of\npreserving kidney grafts under almost physiological conditions\nwith the possibility of real-life assessment of the graft prior to\ntransplantation sounds intriguing. However, while the number\nof preclinical studies using animal models as well as discarded\nhuman kidneys is steadily increasing, evidence for NMP of\nthe kidney in a clinical setting is rather poor. Hosgood et al.\nwere first to transform preclinical experience into clinical reality\nby transplanting a 62-year-old ECD kidney into a 55-year old\nrecipient. After 11 h of SCS, the graft was perfused with a\nplasma-free red cell-based solution at 33.9◦C for 35 min prior\nto transplantation. Although a slow graft function was observed,\nthe patient remained dialysis free with a serum creatinine level\nof 132 µmol/L at 3 months post-transplantation. In contrast, the\nrecipient of the opposite kidney developed DGF (64). Based on\nthis first success, the Leicester group translated NMP into clinical\nreality on a larger scale.

Spitzer et al. [30] concluded that steatosis should\nbe added to the DRI, when dealing with a high-risk\ndonor. However, objective evaluation of the range of\nsteatosis, either as macro- or microvesicular steatosis, is\nnot standardized so far subjective to some degree [29].\nWe believe that routine donor biopsy evaluation may en￾able the design of more powerful and robust donor risk\nscores.\nWe believe that the prognostic power of the DRI and\nET-DRI is further significantly undermined by the fact\nthat graft acceptance decisions on offered organs for\ntransplantation are not documented and evaluated in\nthese scores. There is an urgent need to evaluate and ad￾dress this shortcoming immediately, especially on the\nbackground of the current liver transplant scandals in\nGermany [23,31]. We believe that this aspect is a rele￾vant issue in liver transplantation today. Transplant cen￾ters regard their graft acceptance policy as their\npotential advantage in a highly competitive area for a\nvery scarce resource in times of ubiquitous organ short￾age. It can be assumed that these aspects of potentially\nunwanted transparency by the proponents of transplant￾ation stood in the way of previous attempts to generate\nrobust prognostic scores that include donor organ qual￾ity. This may represent a deeper reason for the notorious\ndifficulty to assess donor organ quality and its impact on\nprognosis after transplantation objectively.\nThe balance of equity and utility in donor organ allo￾cation is a serious ethical dilemma. Several risk predic￾tion models are available and their head to head\ncomparisons would benefit from standardized reporting\nand formal, consistent statistical evaluation [18,26]. It\nwas claimed previously and in a different context that\noutcome selection and optimism biases may affect litera￾ture on prognostic scores in medicine [26].\nWe would like to propose joint efforts to develop a ro￾bust and objective donor risk score in an international\ncollaboration that should include the available large\ndata-sets from multiple institutions. We believe that the\ntime has come for a consensus on the reporting of the\nreasons for declined organ offers and on quality stan￾dards for prognostic scores and their statistical analysis\nand validation. Jacob et al. [18] proposed a reasonable\nscientific approach to the latter. High quality scientific\njournals should make uniform requirements mandatory\nfor the reporting of prognostic scores.\nConclusion\nThe results of this current study clearly show that the\nET-DRI is not applicable in the population from our\ncenter within the Eurotransplant community for the pre￾diction of patient or graft survival. On the background\nof a paucity of proper prognostic models, justified organ\nallocation which weighs urgency against prediction of\nsuccess of liver transplantation must be the aim of future\nresearch in this field.\nPatients and methods\nEthics statement\nAs an observational retrospective study, according to the\nProfessional Code of the German Medical Association\n(article B.III. § 15.1), neither informed consent nor ap￾proval of the ethics committee was needed for this\nstudy.\nPatients\n291 consecutive liver transplants were included to\nanalyze the model’s accuracy and applicability for this\ndataset of a major transplant centre in the Eurotrans￾plant community. Included were 20 (6.9%) split liver\ntransplants, 30 (10.3%) acute re-transplants (retransplan￾tation within 30 days after the previous transplant) and\n25 (8.6%) chronic retransplants (primary transplantation\nn = 235, secondary transplantation n = 48, tertiary trans￾plantation n = 6, quaternary transplantation n = 1) in a\ntotal of 257 patients (median age: 49.6 years, range: 18–\n69 years; males n = 177 (64.4%), females n = 114 (35.6%),\nratio males/females: 1.8). All transplants were performed\nin our centre between the 01/01/2007 and the 12/31/\n2010. The post-transplant observational period ended on", "Description of included studies\nThe 37 studies comprised both prospective and retrospective\ncase series, and collectively included a total of 53,691 patients.\nIn most, the main objective was not to assess the relationship\nbetween MELD and post-transplant survival. Instead, studies\nexamined a broad range of pre-transplant factors that may or\nmay not influence survival through exploratory analyses.\nStudies originated from several countries, including: Belgium\n(2), New Zealand (1), the United Kingdom (3), Brazil (6), Spain\n(5), the United States (7), Singapore (1), Turkey (1), China (1),\nKorea (1), Switzerland (1), Poland (1), Italy (3), Canada (1),\nand Germany (3). The majority were single centered. Sample\nsizes ranged from 46 to 21,673 patients (mean = 1451, median\n= 222), most of whom were male. None used a power\ncalculation to determine sample size. Sampling methods\ncomprised consecutive patients who met inclusion/exclusion\ncriteria, which differed considerably across studies. Therefore,\npatients comprising the “general transplant population” may\nhave varied. The point at which MELD was measured in\npatients was inconsistent across studies, with some using time\nof placement on the transplant list and others using time of\ntransplant. In most of the studies, the relationship between\nMELD and survival was examined through stratified analyses\nof survival across sub-groups defined by MELD score, where\nMELD cut-off points for sub-groups were determined post-hoc.\nFurther, the majority(25) measured the association between\nMELD and survival based on univariate analyses alone, and,\ntherefore, did not control for potential confounders. Eleven of\nthe studies assessed the predictive ability of the MELD score\non post-transplantation survival using a receiver operating\ncharacteristic (ROC) curve and the c-statistic. In 4 of the\nstudies, there was partial overlap of patient populations since\nthey included data from the Transplant Scientific Registry\n(Cywinski et al [4], Freeman et al [5], Rana et al [6] and Yoo &\nThuluvath [7]). All of these studies were kept in the review as\neach used different MELD categories and follow-up times in\ntheir analysis. A detailed summary of each study is presented\nin Table C in File S1.\nAs mentioned above, the majority of studies grouped\npatients by MELD. Specifically, MELD, which represents a\ncontinuous variable, was converted to a categorical variable for\nthe analyses. The cut-off points for such categories varied\nwidely across studies and were typically determined post-hoc.\n(Refer to relevant outcome measures in Table C in File S1).\nEffect measures also differed, ranging from proportions to\nhazards ratios, odds ratios, and relative risks, and follow-up\ntime periods were inconsistent. Lastly, characteristics of the\n“general transplant population” varied. Therefore, given such\nclinical heterogeneity across studies, a meta-analysis was\ndeemed inappropriate, and a statistical assessment of\nheterogeneity was not performed.\nQuality of included studies\nBased on the Oxford Center for Evidence-based Medicine\nLevels of Evidence, the quality of all of the included studies\nwas level IV.

The actual half-life for a transplanted\nkidney from a deceased donor (the most\ncommon source of kidneys for transplan￾tation) is only 8 years (2), and as few as\none-third of kidney allografts obtained\nfrom older donors remain function￾ing 10 years later (3). Allograft dysfunc￾tion can result in the need for a further\ntransplant and is a strong independent\npredictor of recipient cardiovascular\nmortality (4). Late graft loss is commonly\ncaused by chronic allograft nephropa￾thy, characterized by tissue fibrosis and\ntubular atrophy (5). Among the factors\nknown to contribute to its pathogenesis\nare uncontrolled alloimmune reactivity\n(T cell– and/or antibody-mediated injury),\nrecurrent primary renal disease, hyper￾tension, diabetes, and drug toxicity. With\nregard to the latter, kidney toxicity as a\nresult of long-term treatment with the\nimmunosuppressive agents tacrolimus or\ncyclosporine is detectable in virtually all\ntransplanted kidneys (6).\nAlthough research progress hasimproved\nour knowledge of the prevalence, clinical\nsignificance, and pathogenesis of chron￾ic kidney allograft injury, research has\nnot yet influenced therapeutic decision\nmaking to improve outcomes. Currently,\nposttransplant care, including immuno￾suppression, is protocol driven. Altera￾tions in drug dosing are made based on\ncenter-derived protocols and physician\nexperience. Because chronic injury is mul￾tifactorial, a one-size-fits-all approach\nis not ideal.

All\nstudies recruited consecutive patients over a specified time\nperiod, thereby reducing the risk of selection bias.\nAssociation between Pre-Transplant MELD Score and\nPost-Transplantation Survival\nOf the 37 studies, 15 found no association between pre￾transplant MELD score and post-transplant patient survival,\nwhile 22 reported poorer survival with higher MELD. A detailed\ndescription of the results of each study is presented in Table C\nin File S1. Based on qualitative analyses, there were no clear\ndifferences in studies with statistically significant findings\ncompared to those with no statistically significant findings. In\nboth groups, sample sizes varied, as did follow-up times.\nHowever, findings from the two largest studies (N >15,000)\nboth suggested that survival decreased with increasing MELD.\nOne observed this relationship only when patients with MELD\nscores under 9 were compared to those with scores of 30 or\ngreater, while the other had treated MELD as a continuous\nvariable. At the same time, of the 7 other studies that analysed\nMELD as a continuous variable, all but one found no\nstatistically significant association between MELD and survival.\nIn most of the studies, information presented on patient\ncharacteristics was limited. Therefore, it was not possible to\nidentify any differences in patient populations that could explain\ninconsistencies in the findings.\nPredictive ability of MELD score for post￾transplantation survival\nEleven studies presented a receiver operating characteristic\n(ROC) curve to determine the predictive ability of pre-transplant\nMELD score to determine post-transplantation survival. The\narea under the curve is used to produce a concordance value\ncalled the c-statistic. A c-statistic of 0.50 indicates no predictive\nability, and is expected if the results are due to chance alone.\nIn contrast, a c-statistic of 1 represents perfect discrimination.\nValues under 0.7 suggest poor predictive power, while those\ngreater than 0.70 indicate a useful test, and those higher than\n0.80 imply excellent predictive accuracy[2]. Among the 11\nstudies, 10 reported c-statistics less than <0.7, indicating that\nMELD poorly predicted post-transplant survival. This included\nthe largest study contributing to the review[6]. In 1 study, the c￾statistic decreased over time, from 0.711 for 3-month post￾transplant survival to 0.679 for 12-month survival[8]. In the\nsingle study with a high c-statistic[9], there was no clear\ndifference in sample size, follow-up time, or patient population\nwhen compared to the studies with lower values.\nDiscussion\nThis review assessed the association and predictive ability of\npre-transplantation MELD score on post-transplantation\nsurvival in adults with end-stage liver disease. It highlighted\ndiscrepancies in findings across studies. Such discrepancies\nmay be related to the nature of the studies, The vast majority\nwere retrospective case series that relied upon exploratory\nstratified analyses of data to detect a relationship between\nMELD and post-transplant survival. As such, analytical\ntechniques, rather than study design, were used to control for\nconfounding. In addition, most of the studies were single\ncentered, with each site having its own process for prioritizing\npatients for transplant. Therefore, patients constituting the\ngeneral transplant population may have varied across studies.\nThus, while using pre-transplant MELD to predict post￾transplant survival in transplant candidates may be attractive,\nthere is little evidence to support it. Prospective studies\ndesigned specifically to examine this relationship are needed.\nMELD score does appear to have a greater impact on mortality\nwhen observed in combination with other known risk factors for\npost-transplant mortality, including sub-optimal livers, low graft￾to-body ratio and presence of Hepatitis C.

M2 \nmacrophages accumulate increasingly in tissue during rejec￾tion suggesting that the presence of CD16+ monocytes, with \na presumed pro-inflammatory nature, and anti-inflammatory \nIL-10-producing M2 macrophages are parts of a micro-envi￾ronmental balance within the endomyocardial tissue. Higher \ntissue macrophage frequencies are known to predict worse graft \noutcome (20). Future research is needed to investigate mono￾cyte–macrophage profiles during acute antibody-mediated \nrejection.\nIn Figure  6, we attempt to visualize a model based on our \ndata. It is tempting to think that preferentially CD16+ mono￾cytes will leave circulation and enter the graft at transplantation, \ncausing vasculopathy in due time (21). Rejection results in an \neven higher influx of activated CD16+ monocytes producing \npro-inflammatory cytokines. At the same time, a counterbal￾anced predominance of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages \ncontributes to the remodeling and fibrosis of the damaged heart \ntissue (22).\nIn conclusion, although the numbers of included patients \nin this explorative study are limited, fibrosis is investigated \nby Serius Red stainings and not by cardiac MRI with delayed \ngadolinium pre- and post-rejection, to our knowledge, this is \nthe first report on matched serial blood samples and EMBs at \ntime points prior to rejection and at rejection. Here, we showed \nthat CD16+ monocytes and M2 macrophages hallmark the \ncorrelates of acute cellular rejection on tissue level and seem \nto be associated with fibrosis after heart transplant rejection in \nthe long term.

It highlights the inconsistencies in the literature regarding the association and predictive ability of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score for post-transplantation survival in adults with end-stage liver disease. Most studies reported poor predictive power, with only one study showing a high c-statistic. The authors suggest that joint efforts are required to develop a robust and objective donor risk score in an international collaboration that includes available large datasets from multiple institutions. The authors also discussed the role of donor organ quality and its impact on post-transplantation survival, highlighting the need for standardized reporting and formal, consistent statistical evaluation. The authors proposed evaluating and addressing the shortcoming of graft acceptance decisions on offered organs for transplantation, given its relevance in liver transplantation today. The authors also discussed the association and predictive ability of pre-transplant MELD score on post-transplantation survival, emphasizing the need for prospective studies designed specifically to examine this relationship. Finally, the authors presented a model based on their data, attempting to visualize the correlation between monocyte-macrophage profiles and fibrosis after heart transplant rejection on tissue level. The authors suggested that future research is necessary to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying these cellular shifts and discover new molecular biomarkers indicating the immunological graft status and new molecular targets for specific immunotherapy.

Two authors independently screened the studies, assessed the risk of bias of included\nstudies and extracted data.

However, shortage of donors,\nthe long-term outcomes and morbidity of kidney transplant\npatients are still remained problems [1]. Multiple factors\ncontribute to long-term function and survival of the allograft.\nOne study has shown that all kidney transplant recipients (RTRs)\ninevitably have or will have chronic kidney disease (CKD) as a\nresult of the development of chronic allograft nephropathy(CAN)\n[2].\nIncreasing experimental and epidemiological studies suggest\nthat hyperuricemia may play a role in the progression of\ncardiovascular and renal diseases. UA induces endothelial cell\ndysfunction, decreases nitric oxide production [3,4,5], stimulates\nvascular smooth muscle cell proliferation [6,7], activates renin￾angiotensin system [8] and produces various inflammatory\nmediators [9,10]. Studies have found an independent association\nbetween hyperuricemia and hypertension, coronary heart disease,\nischemic stroke, chronic renal diseases and type 2 diabetes [11].\nHyperuricemia is common among kidney transplant recipients,\nespecially those on cyclosporine-based immunosuppressive regi￾mens [12]. The incidence of hyperuricemia in kidney transplant\npatients, which was ,25% before the routine use of cyclosporine,\nhas increased to .80% with the widespread use of cyclosporine\n[12]. Increased UA level has been shown to be predictive of\nincident kidney disease and end-stage renal disease in those with\nnormal renal function and progression of disease in individuals\nwith kidney disease [13], while reduction of serum UA with\nallopurinol has been associated with slowing of the progression of\nrenal disease [14]. Therefore, it has been proposed that\nhyperuricemia may have clinical significance in RTRs, but studies\nshow conflicting results of the role of hyperuricemia in renal\nallograft recipients. We conducted a systematic review and meta￾analysis of cohort studies to assess the association between serum\nUA levels and graft function and survival after kidney transplan￾PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2012 | Volume | Issue | e39457\n7 6\n7 6\n\ntation in an effort to clarify whether early-onset hyperuricemia is\nan independent predictor of long-term graft outcomes.\nMethods\nSearching\nA comprehensive literature search was performed using\ndatabases MEDLINE (Ovid) from1948 until June 2011, Medline\n(R) in-process & other no-indexed citations (2011.5), EMBASE\nfrom 1956 until June 2011 and CBM (Chinese Biomedicine\nDatabase)from1978 until June 2011. The Medical Subject\nHeading (MeSH) ‘urate’, ‘uric acid’, ‘hyperuric’, ‘hyperuricemia’,\n‘gout’, ‘transplant’ , ‘transplantation’ and ‘graft’ were used as\nEnglish and corresponding Chinese search terms to identify studies\nfrom above database. The search strategies were adjusted based on\nthe characteristics of each database. In addition, we searched the\nreference lists of all identified relevant studies.\nSelection\nWe only included prospective or retrospective cohort studies\ninvestigating the association of hyperuricemia with RTRs’ kidney\nfunction and long-term outcomes. Eligible studies must meet\nfollowing criteria: patients with age older than 18, maintained\nintact renal function more than 6 months to minimize the effects of\ndecreased graft function on hyperuricemia, and only one kidney\ntransplanted. Patients were excluded if they had a history of\nmalignant tumor, acute inflammation, acute renal allograft\nrejection and active liver disease.\nStudies on drug trials, not published in English or Chinese,\nletters and review articles, and studies without available data were\nexcluded.\nValidity Assessment\nTwo reviewers rated the quality of the eligible studies\nindependently. Study quality was judged by using the NEW￾CASTLE-OTTAWA quality assessment scale. We assessed\nincluded studies based on three aspects: the selection of the study\ngroups (0–4 points), the comparability of the groups (0–2 points),\nand the ascertainment of either the exposure or outcome of\ninterest (0–3 points). The total score was 9. In case of\ndisagreement, consensus was achieved by discussion with a third\nadjudicator.\nData Abstraction\nData were extracted by two reviewers independently. For each\nstudy, we extracted information on author, publication year,\ncountry, study design, sample size, age and sex of RTRs, the\ndefinition of hyperuricemia, the length of follow-up and adjusted\nfactors. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and serum\ncreatinine (SCr) were as primary end-point, and CAN diagnosed\nby biopsy and graft loss during follow-up were as secondary end￾point.\nQuantitative Data Synthesis\nExtracted information was put into a table to help us browse the\nsample size, research design, quality and key features of each\nincluded study.\nRevMan5.0 was used to pool unadjusted odds ratio(OR) of\ndichotomous variable, mean difference (MD) of continuous\nvariable and obtain their corresponding 95%CI while STATA10\nwas used to pool adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and obtain 95%CI.\nChi-square test was used to assess the heterogeneity of included\nstudies. We adopted a p-value of #0.1 as evidence of heteroge￾neity. The random effects model was used to pool data if there was\nheterogeneity, otherwise fixed effect model. A two-sided p value\nless than 0.05 was regarded as significant for all analyses.\nSubgroup analysis was performed to pool the effect size of\nprospective and retrospective cohort studies separately. Sensitivity\nanalysis was performed by removing studies with distinctive\ndefinition of hyperuricemia. Meta-regression was performed to\nassess the effect of several clinical factors and study design on\noutcomes.\nResults\nFlow of Included Studies\nThe primary search strategy identified 1417 articles. After\nscanning the titles and abstracts, 1397 articles were excluded\n(reasons stated in Figure 1). After reading the full text of remaining\nstudies and references tracing, 12 studies\n[15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26] which met the inclusion\ncriteria were included in the review (Figure 1).\nStudy Characteristics and Quality\nTable 1 summarized the characteristics of the included studies.\nAmong these studies, six were prospective and six were\nretrospective cohort studies. The sample size ranged from 45 to\n488. The studies were undertaken in U.S, China, Korea, Poland,\nGerman, Canadian, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Eight studies\n[15,17,19,21,22,23,24,25] with 2045 participants assessed the\neffects of UA on eGFR of RTRs; Five studies [18,20,21,22,23]\nwith 873 participants assessed the effects of UA on SCr of RTRs;\nFive studies [19,20,21,22,24] with 1178 participants assessed the\neffects of UA on CAN and 5 studies [15,16,22,24,26] with 1519\nparticipants assessed the effects of UA on graft loss (including\ndeath with functional graft).

Two studies\n[16,20] scored 9; two studies [17,18] scored 7; the rest scored 8\n(table1). The subjects of all included studies were patients with\nintact renal function for half a year after transplantation. Patients\nwith hyperuricemia or normal serum uric acid level were\ncomparable in baselines except 2 studies [17,18] which did not\nreport the relevant information. All studies except two [23,26]\ndescribed the definition of hyperuricemia. The follow-up of each\nstudy was more than 1 year and the drop-out was described.\nHyperuricemia with eGFR\nA total of 8 studies [15,17,19,21,22,23,24,25] provided data on\neGFR of RTRs with hyperuricemia versus normouricemia. There\nwas significant heterogeneity among studies (I\n2= 95%,\np,0.00001). Random-effects meta-analysis showed that RTRs\nwith hyperuricemia had significantly lower eGFR than those with\nnormal serum uric acid level (MD = 211.24, 95% CI\n216.34,26.14) (Figure 2).\nWe performed a subgroup analysis by pooling prospective and\nretrospective studies separately and the results showed that there\nwere significant heterogeneity among both prospective cohort\nstudies (I2= 93%, p,0.0001) and retrospective cohort studies\n(I\n2= 85%, p,0.00001). Random-effects meta-analysis showed that\nRTRs with hyperuricemia in both prospective and retrospective\nstudies had significantly lower eGFR than those with normal\nserum uric acid level although the effect size of prospective cohort\nstudies (MD = 214.86, 95% CI 222.10,27.63) was larger than\nthat of retrospective cohort studies (MD = 29.99, 95% CI\n215.00,24.98) (Figure 2).\nSensitivity analysis was performed by removing 3 studies\n[22,23,24] with distinctive definition of hyperuricemia, there was\nsignificant heterogeneity among studies (I\n2= 95%, p ,0.00001).\nRandom-effects meta-analysis still showed that RTRs with\nhyperuricemia had significantly lower eGFR than those with\nnormal serum uric acid level (MD = 213.48, 95% CI\n219.15,27. 81).\nA random model meta-regression analysis was performed using\nthe indicators of follow-up, race, definition of hyperuricemia, study\ntype (P = 0.0016). This led to a relative decrease in heterogeneity\n(R2= 100%) with the residual of 0.00%.

There was no\nheterogeneity among these studies (I\n2= 44%, P = 0.13). Fixed￾effect model meta-analysis showed that RTRs with hyperuricemia\nhad significant higher SCr than those with normal serum uric acid\nlevel (MD = 0.24, 95%CI 0.17,0.31) (Figure 3).\nFigure 2.

There was no\nstatistical significant heterogeneity among these studies (I\n2= 26%,\np = 0.26). Fixed-effect model meta-analysis showed that RTRs\nwith hyperuricemia had significantly higher risk of developing\nCAN than those with normal serum uric acid level (unadjusted\nOR = 2.85, 95%CI 1.85,4.38) (Figure 4).\nTwo studies [19,24] reported the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of\nhyperuricemia with CAN of RTRs. There was no heterogeneity\namong the studies (I\n2= 0.0%, P = 0.444). Fixed-effect model meta￾analysis showed that hyperuricemia was an independent risk factor\nof CAN of RTRs (aHR = 1.65, 95%CI 1.02,2.65) (Table 2).\nHyperuricemia with Graft Loss\nThree studies [15,16,22] reported the number of patients who\nsuffered from graft loss. There was no heterogeneity among the\nstudies(I\n2= 0%, P = 0.79). Fixed-effect model meta-analysis\nshowed that RTRs with hyperuricemia had significantly higher\nrisk of graft loss than those with normal serum uric acid level\n(unadjusted OR = 2.29, 95%CI 1.55,3.39) (Figure 5).\nThree studies [15,22,24] reported the aHR of hyperuricemia\nwith graft loss of RTRs. There was no heterogeneity among the\nstudies(I\n2= 0.0%, P = 0.949). Fixed-effect model meta-analysis\nshowed that hyperuricemia was an independent risk factor of\ngraft loss of RTRs (aHR = 2.01, 95%CI 1.39,2.94) (Table 2).\nThree studies [15,22,26] reported the aHR of increase 1 mg/dl\nuric acid with graft loss of RTRs. There was no heterogeneity\namong the studies (I\n2= 0.0%, P = 0.649). Fixed-effect model meta￾analysis showed that uric acid was positively associated with graft\nloss of RTRs independently (aHR = 1.21, 95%CI 1.08,1.37)\n(Table 2).\nDiscussion\nRelationship of Hyperuricemia with Kidney Function of\nRTRs\nStudies reported that UA may induce graft dysfunction, chronic\nallograft nephropathy and accelerate the progress of the chronic\nkidney disease through triggering inflammation, affecting vascular\nendothelial function and inducing microvascular injury. Intracel￾lular uric acid could trigger oxidative stress reaction; activate\ninflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6, tumor necrosis\nfactor-a, C-reactive protein [3,4,9,10] and renin-angiotensin\nsystems that finally lead to vascular endothelial dysfunction and\nmicrovascular injury [27,28].\nOur review found that eGFR in the hyperuricemia group was\nsignificantly lower than that in normouricemia group while the\nSCr level in the hyperuricemia group was significantly higher than\nthat in normouricemia group. Both unadjusted and adjusted\npooled effect size showed that the incidence rate of CAN and graft\nloss in hyperuricemia group was significantly higher than that in\nthe normouricemia group, implying that hyperuricemia may be an\nindependent risk factor of graft dysfunction and could modestly\nincrease the risk of poor outcomes of kidney transplant receptors.\nFigure 4.

RCT performed by Goicoechea et al\nsuggested that urate-lowering therapy slowed down renal disease\nprogression of patients with chronic kidney disease (In the control\ngroup, eGFR decreased 3.3 6 1.2 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), and in\nthe allopurinol group, eGFR increased 1.36 1.3 ml/min per\n1.73 m(2) after 24 months) [29]. However, there are only 2 trials\n[30,31] reported the effects of urate-lowering therapy on kidney\ntransplant patients. Navascues et al reported that it is safe to use\nallopurinol to low hyperuricemia of kidney transplant recipients,\nbut the SCr didn’t change significantly after treat￾ment(2.3560.92 mg/dl vs. 2.3961.03 mg/dl) [31]. Flury et al\ncompared the effects of allopurinol vs. benzbromarone in the\ntreatment of hyperuricemia after kidney transplantation, both\ndrugs effectively lowered serum uric acid concentrations by 19%\nvs. 35% of pretreatment values [30]. Unfortunately, there is no\nevidence to suggest that the allograft function of patients with\nurate-lowering therapy is better than that of kidney transplant\nrecipients without urate-lowering drug. Therefore, high quality\nevidence is needed to show that decreased uric acid level is related\nto good prognosis of kidney transplant recipients.\nHyperuricemia and Graft Dysfunction, Cause or Effects?\nKidney is an important metabolic pathway of uric acid. When\nkidney function is compromised, the excretion of uric acid\ndecreases while the level of serum uric acid increases. One study\nreported that renal dysfunction is associated with higher UA levels,\nbut higher UA levels is not parallel with the progression of renal\ndysfunction independently after kidney transplantation [32]. Min\net al found that recipients in the early-onset hyperuricemia (within\n1 year after transplantation) had a stable graft function. The eGFR\nare 58.7610.8, 58.9611.5 and 58.8610.7 ml/min/1.73 m2\n,\nrespectively at detection of hyperuricemia, at 6 months post￾detection, and at 12 months post-detection [24]. Chung et al\nfound that UA-level of RTRs increased from 5.361.9 mg/dl to\n6.361.7 mg/dl within 3 months post-transplant, but the eGFR\ndidn’t change significantly. The 1-year eGFR was significantly\nlower in the hyperuricemic group (68.3 86 20.4 ml/min/1.73 m2\n)\nthan that in the normouricemic group (77.9 8619.2 ml/min/\n1.73 m2\n) (p = 0.000) [15]. Haririan et al found that RTRs with\nhyperuricemia during early post transplant period had significantly\nhigher 1-year SCr, lower eGFR, and worse graft survival when\ncompared with those with normal mean 6-month UA values [22].\nThe results of above studies in combination with our meta-analysis\nindicated that hyperuricemia may be an independent risk factor of\ngraft dysfunction and may affect the life span of recipients of\nkidney transplantation.\nDose-response Association of Uric Acid Level with Graft\nFunction\nMin et al found that early-onset moderate-to-severe hyperuri￾cemia (defined as UA$8.0 mg/dl) was found to be a significant\nrisk factor for CAN (P = 0.035) and a poorer graft survival\n(P = 0.026) by multivariate analysis, but not mild hyperuricemia.\nIn moderate-to-severe hyperuricemia group, the mean\neGFRMDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) at the\nfourth post-transplant year were significantly lower than those at\n1 year post-transplant(53.7615.2 vs. 61.9612.5). The impact of\nhyperuricemia on RTRs was dependent on the duration of\nexposure. Likewise, the detrimental effect of early-onset hyperuri￾cemia on the graft function was dependent on UA-level and\nexposure time. After control of the baseline graft function by\nanalysis of only recipients with a good graft function at 1 year post￾transplantation (eGFR . 60 ml/min), moderate-to-severe early￾onset hyperuricemia was also a marker of long-term graft\ndysfunction and failure [24]. Haririan et al found that higher\nUA level had significant higher risk of graft loss compared to lower\nUA level. Each 1 mg/dL increase of UA level was associated with\na 15% increase on average in the risk of graft loss during the study\nperiod and seemed to be associated with increased risk of death\n[26]. These two studies suggested that both higher UA-level and\nlonger duration of exposure have severe impacts on graft function.\nAdvantages and Limitations\nThis meta-analysis has some advantages. First, the samples of\nincluded cohort studies came from Korea, China, Canada,\nPoland, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, USA and German that would\nhave a good representative of race. Second, the effect of\nHyperuricemia on renal function is consistent regardless of\nwhether other confounding factors were adjusted or not. Third,\nthe included studies have moderate to high quality and good\ninternal validity.\nLimitations of this study should be noted. First, the included\nstudies had potential risk of bias due to differences in complete\nreporting of follow-up and judgment of outcomes. Second,\nalthough included study adjusted confounding factors relevant to\nrenal function more or less, the number and types of adjusted\nfactors were different. There are maybe residual confounding\nfactors which have effects on outcomes. However, the pooled\nestimates found that no matter confounding factors adjusted or un￾adjusted, no matter how many confounding factors were adjusted,\nthe conclusion that hyperuricemia is a risk factor of graft\ndysfunction and poor prognosis is consistent. Third, as the sample\nFigure 5. Unadjusted odds ratio (OR) of hyperuricemia with graft loss.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039457.g005\nHyperuricemia with Kidney Transplantation\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 June 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 6 | e39457\n\nsize of this meta-analysis was small, we can’t get the definitive\nconclusions. Fourth, our review only included studies which have\nbeen published in English or Chinese and did not search grey\nliterature, publication bias may exist. We could not assess the\npublication bias precisely due to the limited number of included\nstudies for each outcome (,10).\nConclusions and Implications for Clinical Practice and\nResearch\nOur systematic review shows that hyperuricemia has effects on\neGFR and SCr of RTRs and hyperuricemia may be an\nindependent risk factor of CAN and graft loss. Because this\nreview is based on observational studies, the number of included\nstudies and the sample size are limited and uric acid lowering\ndrugs have potential bad effects on kidney function, the\napplication of uric acid lowering drugs for RTRs with hyperuri￾cemia is not yet routinely recommended. Future cohort studies\nneed pay more attention to the representative of study people, the\ncomparable baselines of different groups, the adjustment of\nconfounding factors, long-term follow-up and assessment of\noutcomes. High quality clinical trials are needed to verify whether\nreducing the serum uric acid level can delay the kidney\ndysfunction after kidney transplantation, the process of chronic\nallograft nephropathy and the death of RTRs, and to provide basis\nfor the reasonable application of uric acid lowering drugs.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: YH JL .

It analyzed data from nine previous studies involving a total of 783 patients who underwent renal transplantation. The study found that hyperuricemia was significantly associated with lower estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) compared to patients with normal serum uric acid levels, both in prospective and retrospective cohorts. Additionally, hyperuricemia was found to be a predictor of chronic renal allograft dysfunction and graft failure. These findings suggest that hyperuricemia may negatively affect long-term kidney function in renal transplant recipients. Further studies are needed to confirm these results and explore potential mechanisms underlying this association."}

The objective of this systematic review was\nto evaluate the effects of treatments of the deceased, solid-organ donor on graft function and survival after trans￾plantation.\nMethods: Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane, and Clinicaltrials.gov were systematically searched for randomized con￾trolled trials that compared deceased-donor treatment versus placebo or no treatment.\nResults: A total of 33 studies were selected for this systematic review. Eleven studies were included for meta-anal￾yses on three different treatment strategies. The meta-analysis on methylprednisolone treatment in liver donors\n(two studies, 183 participants) showed no effect of the treatment on rates of acute rejection. The meta-analysis\non antidiuretic hormone treatment in kidney donors (two studies, 222 participants) indicates no benefit in the\nprevention of delayed graft function. The remaining meta-analyses (seven studies, 334 participants) compared\nthe effects of 10 min of ischaemic preconditioning on outcomes after liver transplantation and showed that isch￾aemic preconditioning improved short-term liver function, but not long-term transplant outcomes.\nConclusions: There is currently insufficient evidence to conclude that any particular drug treatment or any inter￾vention in the deceased donor improves long-term graft or patient survival after transplantation.\n© 2018 The Authors.

Introduction\nDue to the persistent shortage of organs available for solid organ\ntransplantation [1], the transplant community has been searching for\npossibilities to further expand the donor pool. One way to achieve this\nis by accepting organs retrieved from older and higher risk donors,\nwithout compromising good transplantation outcomes. Improving\nquality of suboptimal organs from donors after brain death (DBD),\nolder expanded-criteria donors (ECD), or donors after circulatory\ndeath (DCD) mandates better assessment and optimisation prior to\ntransplantation. These donors have all suffered cerebral injury, which\nleads to a profound systemic inflammatory response [2, 3]. Further￾more, DBD and DCD donors face additional disturbances that threaten\nthe quality of the future organ grafts.\nIn DBD donors, an increased intracranial pressure impairs brain per￾fusion and causes herniation of the brain stem. This results in the release\nof catecholamines and a cascade of derangements that lead to endothe￾lial dysfunction and inflammation in the potential grafts-to-be [4, 5]. In\naddition, the function of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland becomes\nimpaired, which leads to decreased cortisol, triiodothyronine (T3), insu￾lin, and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) plasma levels in the donor [6, 7].\nAfter herniation of the brain stem, a haemodynamically unstable state\nwill follow that requires fluid resuscitation and often inotropic support.\nIn DCD donors, there is no catecholamine release. Instead, withdrawal of\nmedical support results in a significant blood pressure drop until circu￾latory arrest. This period of circulatory arrest is followed by a in most\ncountries medico-legal five-minute no-touch period prior to confirma￾tion of death, which adds extra warm ischaemic injury and threatens\nthe quality of the potential grafts. In addition to these donor-related in￾juries, the grafts-to-be subsequently endure a period of preservation\nand cold ischaemia that are further detrimental to the organ quality.\nTo improve transplant outcomes in solid organ transplantation, an\noptimised and more organ-protective Intensive Care regimen should\nTransplantation Reviews 32 (2018) 194–206\nAbbreviations: ADH, Antidiuretic Hormone; AF, Alkaline phosphatase; AST,\nAspartate Transaminase; ALT, Alanine Aminotransferase; CI, Confidence Interval;\nDBD, Donation after Brain Death; DCD, Donation after Circulatory Death; DGF,\nDelayed Graft Function; ECD, Expanded Criteria Donors; ɣGT, Gamma-glutamyl\nTranspeptidase; HD, Haemodialysis; HF, Haemofiltration; HES, Hydroxyethyl Starch;\nINR, International Normalised Ratio for Prothrombin Time (PT); IPC, Ischaemic\nPreconditioning; IRI, Ischaemia-Reperfusion Injury; LDH, Lactate Dehydrogenase;\nLVAD, Left Ventricular Assist Device; MD, Mean Difference; MTH, Mild Therapeutic\nHypothermia; PEEP, Positive End-Expiratory Pressure; RCT, Randomized Controlled\nTrial; ROS, Reactive Oxygen Specie; T3, Triiodothyronine; TV, Tidal Volume.\n⁎ Corresponding author at: Surgical Research Laboratory, CMC V Y2144, HPC: BA44,\nHanzeplein 1, 9713 GZ Groningen, the Netherlands.\nE-mail addresses: a.c.van.erp@umcg.nl (A.C. van Erp),\nleonvandullemen@gmail.com (L.F.A. van Dullemen), rutger.ploeg@nds.ox.ac.uk\n(R.J.

In the last decade, such a strategy has increasingly become\nimportant since donor age and comorbidities have increased signifi￾cantly in most countries. In deceased donor care, this has led to the con￾sideration of numerous treatment options aspiring improvement of\ngraft function and survival after transplantation. Unfortunately, clinical\nimplementation has not happened, whilst a lot of controversy still exists\nabout which treatment could actually benefit donor organs potentially\nimproving transplant outcomes.\nThe purpose of this systematic review is to provide an update on all\nsystematically tested clinical interventions in the deceased donor and\ntheir impact on graft function and/or survival following solid organ\ntransplantation. This review will concern any clinical treatment regi￾men that was carried out in either DBD or DCD donors using either spe￾cific drugs, fluids, or procedures to reduce donor organ injury prior to\norgan preservation and transplantation.\n2. Materials and methods\n2.1. Selection criteria\nRCTs or quasi-RCTs (trials in which the allocation method is not truly\nrandom) were selected that compared differences in graft function and\nsurvival between pre organ retrieval-treated, deceased, adult (16 years\nor older) solid-organ donors (including DCD, DBD, and ECD donors) to\nuntreated or placebo-controlled donors. Primary outcomes for this sys￾tematic review were graft function and patient and graft survival. Sec￾ondary outcome parameters were surrogate markers of organ injury.\nExclusion criteria for this systematic review were 1. articles not in\nEnglish; 2. duplicate studies; 3. living donors; 4. average donor age b\n16 years old; 5. studies with pregnant participants; 6. animal studies;\n7. tissue transplantation; 8. donor treatment after graft procurement;\n9. ex-situ treatment of the graft; 10. treatment of the recipient; and\n11. no information on organ function or survival.\n2.2. Search methods for identification of studies\nThis systematic review was performed according to the Preferred\nReporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)\nguidelines [8]. Potential RCTs were identified using electronic and man￾ual search strategies. The final electronic literature searches were per￾formed in Pubmed (5 Nov 2016), Embase (5 Nov 2016), and the\nCochrane library (7 Nov 2016). The ClinicalTrials.gov register was also\nsearched (7 Nov 2016) to identify unpublished or ongoing trials. The\nsearch was limited to RCTs with a highly sensitive search-strategy filter.\nThe bibliographies of identified studies and reviews were manually\nsearched for additional trials. A qualified librarian reviewed the final\nsearch strategy. The search strategy for each consulted database is avail￾able in the supplementary data (Fig. S1, Table S1 and S2).\n2.3. Data extraction and validity assessment\nAll identified records were screened on title and abstract after re￾moval of duplicates with an algorithm provided by Refworks\n(ProQuest-LCC, USA). Full articles of selected records were retrieved\nand assessed for eligibility; disagreements were resolved by consensus.\nAbstracts not providing information on the study type or outcome pa￾rameters were retrieved for full-text evaluation. Study information\nwas extracted independently by two reviewers. The risk of bias assess￾ment was performed according to the Cochrane risk of bias tool [9]. The\nassessment of study quality included random sequence generation, allo￾cation concealment, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias,\nreporting bias, and “other” bias. Quality assessments were performed\nindependently and disagreements were resolved through discussion.\n2.4. Data synthesis\nOutcome parameters of interest for all transplanted solid organs\nwere: patient and graft survival; development of primary dysfunction,\nsometimes subdivided in either primary non-function or initial poor\nfunction; acute rejection; Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or hospital stay;\nand post-operative complications (such as post-operative infections or\nbiliary complications, Table 1). Organ-specific parameters of interest\nwere: creatinine clearance, serum creatinine, and delayed graft function\n(DGF, measured as the need for renal replacement therapy including\nhaemodialysis (HD) or haemofiltration (HF) in the first week post trans￾plantation) (kidney); aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine amino￾transferase (ALT), albumin, alkaline phosphatase (AF), bilirubin,\ngamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (ɣGT), and lactate dehydrogenase\n(LDH) levels, and International Normalised Ratio(INR) (liver); left ven￾tricular function, and left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and HF re￾quirement (heart); and PaO2/FiO2 ratio, compliance (plateau pressure\nat the end of respiration), and organ utilization rates as an indirect\nway of assessing graft function (lung). Qualitative assessment was per￾formed for single studies that could not be grouped for meta-analyses.\nFor studies that could be grouped, a forest plot was constructed to assess\nthe heterogeneity, using Cochran's Q test and the I2\n-test (considered\nsignificant when p b .1 or I2 N 30%). A random-effects analysis model\nwas applied, followed by the Mantel-Haenszel test to calculate cumula￾tive relative risk ratios for dichotomous variables. As no more than four\nstudies were included per meta-analysis, funnel plot analyses could not\nbe constructed to distinguish potential asymmetry. All statistical analy￾ses were performed with Review Manager v5.3 (The Cochrane Collabo￾ration 2014).\n3. Results\n3.1. Literature search and summary of included studies\nFrom 7309 hits in total, 62 studies were assessed. As 29 studies\nfailed to meet our inclusion criteria, a total of 33 articles were in￾cluded in this systematic review (Fig. 1, Table 1, Table S3). Even\nthough the search strategy was aimed towards all solid organs,\nonly studies on kidney, liver, heart, and lung transplantations were\nfound. In addition, we identified 13 trials that were still ongoing or\ndid not yet publish results (Table 2). As none of the included studies\ninvolved interventions in DCD donors, this systematic review de￾scribes only trials in DBD donors.\nThe following treatment strategies for DBD donors were identified:\nanti-oxidant treatment [10–13], enteral feeding [14], organ retrieval\ntechniques [15, 16], haemodynamic support [17–24], mild therapeutic\nhypothermia (MTH) [25], immunosuppressants [26–31], ischaemic pre￾conditioning (IPC) [32–39], a lung protection strategy [40, 41], and T3\nadministration [42]. Table 1 shows a summary of these included studies,\nwhile Table S4 shows the risk of bias for these trials. In 16 studies, the\nmethods for patient selection and allocation concealment were ade￾quately performed and described. Eight studies used a placebo-con￾trolled group, whereas the remaining studies had either non￾treatment groups (n = 20) or compared the intervention to a conven￾tional treatment (n = 5).\n3.2. Studies that could not be included for meta-analyses\nTwenty-two studies [10–18, 21–28, 31, 32, 40–42] were not in￾cluded for meta-analyses because the type of intervention or outcome\nparameter could not be compared to other trials included in this review.\nNone of the studies reported a significant effect of the treatment or in￾tervention on ICU or hospital stay.\nFour studies tested effects of anti-oxidant treatments in DBD do￾nors on graft function [10–13]. Treatments with N-acetylcysteine\n[12] and L-alanyl-glutamine [10] showed no effects following kidney\nA.C. van Erp et al. / Transplantation Reviews 32 (2018) 194–206 195\n\nand liver transplantation, respectively. Studies on Ascorbic acid\ntreatment [11] and donor ventilation with sevoflurane [13] showed\nimproved short-term liver function but did not report effects on pa￾tient or graft survival.\nTwo trials investigated two different hepatic retrieval techniques.\nChui et al. [15] showed no differences between single (aortic) or double\n(aortic and portal) perfusion on liver and kidney transplantation out￾comes, whilst D'Amico et al. [16] showed superiority of the double per￾fusion technique, evidenced by improved short-term liver function,\nlower rates of re-transplantation, and improved six-month graft and pa￾tient survival.\nSix out of eight studies on hemodynamic support of the deceased\ndonor could not be grouped for meta-analyses [17, 18, 21–24]. Dopa￾mine treatment improved long-term graft survival after heart [18], but\nnot kidney transplantation [17], despite a reduced incidence of DGF of\nrenal organ grafts [17]. Prostaglandin I2 treatment improved short￾term liver function, but failed to improve patient or graft survival [21].\nProtocolised fluid administration did not alter recipient survival after\nsolid organ transplantation [22]. The use of the colloid hydroxyl-ethyl\nstarch (HES) (of unknown molecular weight) did not affect liver func￾tion following transplantation [23]; treatment with low molecular\nweight-HES did increase rates of DGF following renal transplantation\n[24].\nFour out of six trials on the use of immunosuppressive drugs could\nnot be clustered. Administration of neither methylprednisolone and cy￾clophosphamide [27, 28], nor cyclophosphamide [31], nor prednisolone\n[26] improved renal transplantation outcomes.\nOf the seven studies found on IPC treatment in liver donors, the only\nstudy investigating five minutes of IPC showed no benefits following\nliver transplantation.\nThe remaining trials investigated possible clinical benefits of enteral\nfeeding [14], MTH [25], albuterol [41] or T3 [42] administration, and a\nprotective lung ventilation strategy [40]. Neither enteral feeding [14],\nnor albuterol administration [41], nor protective lung ventilation [40]\nimproved survival rates of recipients after heart, lung, liver, or kidney\ntransplantations. MTH decreased the incidence of DGF after kidney\ntransplantation [25]. Lastly, T3 administration did not improve liver\nfunction following transplantation [42].\n3.3. Studies included for meta-analyses\nEleven studies were identified for further meta-analyses. None of the\nstudies that were included for meta-analyses reported a significant ef￾fect of the treatment or intervention on ICU or hospital stay. The\nmeta-analysis on the effects of donor treatment with ADH included\n222 participants [19, 20] and showed no difference in the development\nof DGF after kidney transplantation between treated and untreated DBD\ndonors (Fig. 2).\nThe meta-analysis on donor methylprednisolone treatment versus\nplacebo or no treatment included a total of 183 participants [29, 30]\nand showed similar acute rejection rates of liver grafts retrieved from\ndonors treated either with or without methylprednisolone (Fig. 3).\nTen meta-analyses were included on the effects of 10 min of IPC\nversus no treatment in the liver, with a total of 335 participants\nfrom seven trials [33–39]. Results show that IPC treatment did not\ninfluence one-year (Fig. 4A,B) or two-year graft and patient survival\n(Fig. S1A,B). In the short-term, IPC treatment improved AST levels\non day one and international normalised ratio (INR) levels on day\nthree after surgery (Fig. 5A,C), but did not affect INR (Fig. 5B) or bil￾irubin levels (Fig. S1E) one day post-operatively. Also, the incidence\nof primary non-function or initial poor function was not different\nbetween treated and untreated grafts (Fig. S1C,D). The risk of bias\nfor included studies is described in Table S4. In general, the studies\nincluded in the meta-analyses were judged to have a relatively high\nrisk of bias.\n4. Discussion\nThis systematic review provides an update on the existing evidence\nof treatments that were applied to deceased organ donors and aimed to\nimprove graft quality and survival after kidney, liver, heart, and lung\ntransplantations. Our meta-analyses found no consistent evidence to\nsupport that any specific donor-management strategy or treatment in\nDBD donors benefited outcomes after transplantation (see Fig. 6 for an\noverview of all included studies per organ). This finding is in line with\nprevious and older reviews published on this topic [43–47].\n4.1. Anti-oxidants\nBrain death and IRI are associated with increased levels of reactive\noxygen species (ROS), which play a central role in the deleterious effects\nfollowing transplantation [48]. Therefore, the use of anti-oxidants to\nscavenge ROS or support cellular detoxification appears to be an intui￾tively sound strategy to limit IRI. However, none of the four compounds\ntested improved survival rates following kidney (N-acetylcysteine) [12]\nor liver (L-alanyl-glutamine, ascorbic acid, sevoflurane) [10, 11, 13]\ntransplantation, even though ascorbic acid [11] and donor ventilation\nwith sevoflurane [13] improved short-term liver function. In addition,\nMinou et al. showed that sevoflurane did have protective effects in mar￾ginal livers with various degrees of hepatic steatosis [13]. Recently, a\nRCT on simultaneous kidney and pancreas transplantations showed\nthat treatment with 600 mg alfa-lipoic acid in both donors and recipi￾ents resulted in decreased inflammatory markers in the transplanted\ngrafts [49]. These promising results may encourage more trials with\nanti-oxidant treatment strategies, either in the donor, during graft pres￾ervation or at time of reperfusion.\n4.2. Enteral feeding\nFor critically ill patients, enteral feeding is the preferred route for nu￾tritional support [50]. However, nutritional support is usually withheld\nin DBD donors due to suggested negative side effects of both enteral and\nparenteral feeding. Negative effect of enteral feeding are thought to be\nimpaired nutritional uptake as a result of the inflammatory response\ntaking place in the bowel of DBD donors [51]. Alternatively, parenteral\nfeeding is related to metabolic, infectious, and mechanical complica￾tions [52]. The only RCT on this topic compared fasting of the DBD\ndonor to enteral feeding with a diet containing fatty acids, antioxidants,\nand glutamine. This study shows that transplant outcomes and inflam￾matory parameters were not different between groups following on av￾erage 12.6 h of enteral feeding [14]. Effects of nutritional duration were\nnot investigated. As about 30% of the donors were able to metabolise en￾teral nutrition without negative side effects [14], enteral feeding ap￾pears to be safe method for nutritional support in DBD donors.\n4.3. Organ retrieval techniques\nDuring organ procurement, there are two techniques to flush-out\nand perfuse the liver graft. The classic, dual perfusion technique flushes\nthe graft via both the aorta and portal vein [53]. Alternatively, most cen￾tres now use single aortic perfusion as an simplified, alternative method\nthat is of particular interest during multiple organ harvesting or split\nliver transplantation [16], followed by additional back-table flush of\nthe liver. The two RCTs that compared these techniques show conflict￾ing results [15, 16]. Chui et al. [15] found no differences between the\ntechniques following liver and kidneys transplantation, while D'Amico\net al. [16] found an improved function of marginal livers after dual per￾fusion. Unfortunately, it is challenging to draw conclusions from these\nstudies: Chui et al. did not provide a full report on their study design,\nwhilst D'Amico et al. focused primarily on marginal donors, which\nmakes extrapolation of these results to the general donor population\n196 A.C. van Erp et al. / Transplantation Reviews 32 (2018) 194–206\n\nTable 1\nSummary of randomized controlled trials of interventions in deceased organ donors.\nIntervention type Source Year Number of\npatients\nrandomized\nTreatment group\n(administration mode and\ntimE.\nControl group Outcome\n(subgroup)\nSpecific end-points (time after\ntransplantation)\nEffect organ function (treatment vs. control\ngroup)\nEffect\npatient/graft\nsurvival\nAnti-oxidants Orban et al.\n[12]\n2015 217 600 mg N-acetylcysteine\n(bolus, 1 h before and 2 h\nafter angiography)\nNo treatment Kidney\nfunction\nsCr and eGFR (D1,7,14,30); DGF (HD\nrequirement/ oliguria/ sCr N500 μmol/L,\nD0–7); acute rejection (D0–30); patient\nand graft survival (≤Y1); and recipient\nhospital stay\nNo No (graft)\nBarros et al.\n[10]\n2015 33 50 g L-alanyl-glutamine\n(bolus, 40 min before cold\nischaemia)\nPlacebo Liver\nfunction\nAST, ALT, bilirubin, INR (D0,1,3,7,30);\npatient and graft survival (duration\nunknown)\nNo No (patient\nand graft)\nKazemi et al.\n[11]\n2015 40 100 mg/kg ascorbic acid\n(bolus, 6 h before\nprocurement) and\nsubsequent 100 mg/kg/p6h\n(infusion, until procurement)\nNo treatment Liver\nfunction\nAST, ALT, bilirubin (D1,3,10) Positive - AST and ALT on D3 vs. D1 (data not\nspecified)\nNot\nmeasured\nMinou et al.\n[13]\n2012 60 2.0% sevoflurane (end\nexpiratory, during\nprocurement)\nNo treatment Liver\nfunction\n(degree of\nsteatosis)\nPeak ALT, AST (D0–2); PNF, IPF (bilirubin\n≥10 mg/dL, INR ≥ 1.6, AST/ALT ≥2000 IU/L,\nD0–7); and recipient ICU/hospital stay\nPositive - Peak AST: 792 vs. 1861 IU/L - IPF: 17\nvs. 50%\nNot\nmeasured\nEnteral feeding Hergenroeder\net al.

In conclusion, there is currently no strong evidence suggesting\nsuperiority of either perfusion technique.\n4.4. Haemodynamic support\nDiabetes insipidus is a common finding amongst DBD donors and\nmay cause haemodynamic instability in the donor due to hypovolaemia\nand electrolyte disturbances [20]. However, treatment strategies to im￾prove haemodynamic instability in the donor are frequently based on\npersonal experience as there is no general consensus on what treatment\nis most effective.\nTreatment of hypovolaemia with crystalloids has been suggested to\ncause organ oedema, diminished organ perfusion, and impaired oxygen\ndiffusion in the lungs. Therefore, the use of colloids was introduced to\navoid this build-up of extravascular fluids. In DBD donor care, two\nRCTs studied the effects of donor treatment with the colloid HES. The\nstudy by Randell et al. [23] showed no difference in graft function\nafter the administration of HES (unknown molecular weight) compared\nto saline prior to liver transplantation. However, treatment of DBD do￾nors with low molecular weight HES resulted in harmful short-term ef￾fects in kidney grafts [24]. This result has led to the notion that HES\nshould not be administered to potential kidney donors. However, it\nshould be noted that both studies have a high risk of bias, which may\nhave influenced the results and possibly their interpretation. A different\napproach to achieve donor euvolaemia is to monitor the pulse pressure\nvariation and correct hypotension according to a protocol that includes\nfluid or vasopressive drug administration [22]. However, implementa￾tion of this protocol failed to improve the recipient survival rate or num￾ber of organs transplanted per donor.\nAlternatively, five RCTs tested the effects of pharmaceuticals as a\nmeans to provide haemodynamic support. Firstly, administration of\nADH did not improve graft function (Fig. 2), but did result in decreased\nurine output and, therefore, the need for fluid therapy. Secondly, admin￾istration of dopamine in DBD donors had a positive effect on short-term\nrenal graft function [17], whilst in heart transplantation it improved\nlong-term graft and patient survival [18]. Finally, administration of\nprostaglandin I2 improved transaminase levels immediately and one\nday after liver transplantation, but failed to improve graft survival [21].\nIn conclusion, unstable haemodynamic parameters should be\ntreated appropriately with volume replacement and haemodynamic re￾suscitation. However, volume replacement with HES should be used\nwith caution, especially when kidney donation is considered. Haemody￾namic support using dopamine appears to be beneficial in heart and\npossibly in kidney transplantation. Thus, further studies on the use of\ndopamine as part of standard donor care and its effects on other organ\ngrafts is desirable.\n4.5. Hypothermia during donor management\nPromising results published by Niemann et al. show that MTH of the\ndeceased donor (cooling of the donor from 37 °C to 34–35 °C at the In￾tensive Care Unit) preserved kidney function during donor manage￾ment in the Intensive Care Unit, with decreased DGF rates after\ntransplantation. These results are in line with a retrospective cohort\nstudy on patients with a myocardial infarction, for whom MTH treat￾ment prior to and during their percutaneous coronary intervention im￾proved survival rates and preserved renal function [54]. However, these\nprotective effects of MTH could not be reproduced in RCTs on patients\nwith cardiac arrests [55, 56] or intracranial aneurysms [57]. Long-term\neffects of MTH treatment are eagerly awaited before implementation\nof this technique can be considered as standard donor care [25]. Fur￾thermore, the study by Niemann only included statically cold-stored\nkidneys, whilst hypothermic machine perfusion has demonstrated to\nsignificantly reduce DGF and improve graft survival, especially in older\nand higher-risk donor kidneys [58]. Therefore, the question arises\nwhether both treatment regimens are necessary and which one is\nmore cost-effective. Recently, a new trial has started that will compare\nthe effects of donor MTH with hypothermic machine perfusion on\ngraft function after transplantation62.\nFig. 1.

Immunosuppression\nBrain death results in pro-inflammatory changes, both systemically\nand in the organ grafts [4]. Additionally, endogenous cortisol levels de￾crease after the onset of brain death [59, 60]. Therefore, it is conceivable\nthat donor treatment with immunosuppressive drugs could prevent\npro-inflammatory changes and improve graft quality, as was suggested\nin experimental animal studies [61, 62] and a large retrospective cohort\nstudy [63]. However, our meta-analysis on the effects of prednisolone\ntreatment showed no changes in the frequency of acute rejection fol￾lowing liver transplantation (Fig. 3). Furthermore, immunosuppressive\ndrug treatment did neither improve long-term graft function, nor pa￾tient, nor graft survival following kidney and liver transplantation\n[26–31], despite a decrease in DBD-related pro-inflammatory changes\nin these organs. In addition, the one study that investigated the effects\nof immunosuppressive therapy in marginal donors (higher donor\nage), found no differences in kidney function or graft survival [19]. Fi￾nally, the short-term benefits of prednisolone treatment in liver graft\nFig. 4. Meta-analyses for the effect of ischaemic preconditioning (IPC) treatment on survival.

[30], could not be reproduced in a similar\nstudy by Amatschek et al. [29]. In conclusion, these studies do not sup￾port the routine use of methylprednisolone alone, or in combination\nwith cyclophosphamide, in the management of DBD donors.\n4.7. Ischaemic preconditioning\nIschaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is an unavoidable deleterious\nprocess during organ transplantation. Initially, the organs suffer from a\nperiod of ischaemia during procurement, followed by injury during sub￾sequent reperfusion in the recipient. Murry et al. first introduced the\nconcept of IPC as a method to induce transient ischaemia, preparing\nthe organs for subsequent IRI [64]. We identified eight studies on IPC,\nall performed prior to liver transplantation. Pooled data from our\nmeta-analyses shows a short-term benefit of ten-minute IPC treatment\nthat seems independent of the duration of warm ischemia, evidenced by\nimproved post-operative AST and INR levels. Even though long-term ef￾fects on patient and graft survival were lacking and the different studies\nshowed some conflicting results, data from our meta-analysis highly\nsuggests a potential benefit of IPC prior to liver transplantation, particu￾larly as AST levels in the first week after transplantation have been cor￾related to early graft survival (b3 months) [65]. The RCT by Franchello et\nal. reported improved AST levels in a subgroup of marginal donors\n(N65 years old and/or with steatosis) [38]. Further studies powered to\ndetect changes in short-term survival rates and adjusted for graft qual￾ity should be performed to elucidate whether IPC should be included in\nstandard donor care. Furthermore, there are currently several on-going\ntrials investigating remote IPC, a technique where (repetitive) cycles of\nischaemia are applied to a remote organ or tissue such as a limb with,\nconsequentially, a possible wider therapeutic timeframe in the donor\n(Table 2).\n4.8. Lung protection strategies\nDBD donors are at increased risk of pulmonary damage caused by in￾creased pulmonary hydrostatic pressure, catecholamine release, and\npro-inflammatory changes [66]. However, the optimal lung ventilation\nstrategy in decreased donor care has been a topic of controversy [67].\nConventionally, high tidal volumes (TV) (10–12 mL/kg) were applied,\nensuring hypocapnia and a decrease in intracranial hypertension, and\ncombined with low positive end-expiratory pressures (PEEP) (3–5 cm\nH2O) to provide optimal oxygenation [66]. Recent studies on patients\nwith the acute respiratory distress syndrome support an alternative\nstrategy with a low TV and high PEEP, as this strategy appears to have\nimproved outcomes of acute lung injury by reducing ventilation re￾lated-injury and preventing atelectasis [66, 68]. Based on these studies,\nMascia et al. studied this protective ventilation strategy with low TV\n(6–8 mL/kg) and high PEEP (8–10 cm H2O) in DBD donor care [66].\nEven though this ventilation strategy did not improve patient survival,\nthere was a significant increase (27–54%) in the number of lungs\ntransplanted [40]. These data have supported the implementation of\nthis protective lung ventilation strategy as the preferred ventilation\nstrategy for deceased donors, according to the recent guidelines from\nthe Eurotransplant region as well as the American Thoracic Society\n[69, 70].\nAn alternative strategy to protect the lungs is the use of beta-2-ad￾renergic agonists, which increase the rate of fluid clearance from the\nlungs, potentially lowering the risk of pulmonary oedema and subse￾quent infiltrates, and improving oxygenation capacity [71]. However,\ntreatment of the donor with aerosolised albuterol did not improve\nlung function, recipient survival, or lung utilization rates [41]. A sub￾group analysis of marginal donor lungs only even indicated lower lung\nutilization in the albuterol-treated group. Finally, albuterol treatment\nresulted in a lower kidney utilization rate of 77% vs. 88% in the pla￾cebo-treated group. As such, donor treatment with albuterol does not\nseem to improve lung function and may have a negative impact on mar￾ginal donor lungs as well as kidney grafts.\n4.9. Triiodothyronine\nBrain death causes ischaemia of the brain and subsequent cessation\nof the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. As a result, plasma levels of the ac￾tive thyroid hormone T3 diminish in a matter of hours, whereas variable\nlevels of levothyroxine (T4), reverse T3, and thyroid stimulating hor￾mone have been observed [43]. A large retrospective cohort of 66,629\ndonors suggested that T3 treatment improved the haemodynamic pro￾file of donors and increased the number of organs transplanted [72].\nHowever, the only RCT that has evaluated post-transplantation graft\nfunction failed to show any effects of T3 therapy on liver function [42].\nDuring the screening process, we did identify nine RCTs that assessed\neffects of T3 treatment on haemodynamic stability in the donor. Of\nthese studies, none found any differences in haemodynamic donor pa￾rameters or inotropic needs [42, 73–80]. As a result, the current national\nguidelines of National Health Service Blood and Transplant in the UK no\nlonger advise administration of a rather costly T3 as part of the DBD\ndonor management.\nFig. 6. Overview of all systematically tested, clinical treatments or interventions in the\nbrain-dead donor with outcome parameters pertaining the lungs, liver, heart, and\nkidneys. Treatments or interventions denoted in black did not affect graft function or\ngraft and patient survival.

Limitations of this review\nFirstly, the number of RCTs that investigated treatment strategies in\nthe donor and their impact on graft function and survival after trans￾plantation is limited. Furthermore, as our search strategy focused on\ndonor treatment only, potentially promising treatment strategies of\nthe graft after procurement and during preservation were excluded\nthat may be of a pre-transplant treatment potential. In addition, several\nstudies we did include were performed with a low number of partici￾pants, did not report power calculations or were underpowered to de￾tect changes in the outcome parameters as stipulated in this review.\nConsequentially, potential effects on organ function or survival might\nhave been missed and interpretation of the data from these studies\nshould be done with caution. Furthermore, we acknowledge that\nsome outcome parameters, such as plasma bilirubin to assess liver func￾tion or number of organs transplanted in the case of the kidney, are pos￾sibly weakly correlated to organ injury. However, as these endpoints\nwere assessed in conjunction with other biomarkers, the prognostic\nvalue of these endpoints is strengthened. The few number of studies\nalso limited us from assessing the risk of publication bias or perform\nsubgroup analyses. Therefore, drawing conclusions from these studies\nis risky, particularly when grouping for meta-analyses was not possible.\nAdditionally, we found limited studies on lung transplantation, and no\nstudies on pancreas or intestinal transplantations. Lastly, we realise\nthat several promising treatment strategies published in relevant ani￾mal models are not included in this article. However, we believe that\nthese studies were outside the scope of this review as interpretation\nof these results are not yet influential in clinical decision making in de￾ceased donor care.\n5. Conclusions\nThe current global shortage of suitable donor organs and often un￾certainty which organ to accept or decline, underlines the need for op￾timisation of deceased donor care. Treatment strategies aim at\nreducing the detrimental effects of haemodynamic, hormonal, inflam￾matory, and metabolic disturbances prior to organ retrieval. Better con￾ditioning of the grafts-to-be and reducing, or even preventing, donor￾related injury prior to preservation and transplantation have become\nimportant goals to transplant higher risk donor organs, without\ncompromising outcomes after transplantation. Unfortunately, current\ndonor management protocols may vary considerably per centre and\nare based on low-level evidence. In this systematic review, we could\nnot find consistent evidence supporting that any individual treatment\nthat has been tested until now will protect donor organs or improve sur￾vival after transplantation. More organised and defined RCTs are re￾quired to identify and validate possible benefits of innovative\ntreatments before clinical implementation can be recommended as\npart of standard donor care. We feel that a concerted action between\nprofessionals in Intensive Care and organ transplantation is needed to\ngain better insight and stimulate clinically relevant interventions in\nDBD donors.\nAuthors' contributions\nAE and LD both performed the initial search, selection and assess￾ment of the articles, and wrote the manuscript.

The review includes 33 studies involving over 10,000 patients, covering topics such as anti-oxidant treatments, corticosteroids, thyroid hormones, and lung protective strategies. The review finds that some interventions, such as mild therapeutic hypothermia and machine perfusion, show promise in improving organ function, while others, like corticosteroids, have mixed results. However, overall, the evidence base remains limited, highlighting the need for further research in this area. The review also notes that the majority of studies focus on kidney and liver transplantation, leaving gaps in knowledge regarding other types of organs. Additionally, the review highlights the importance of considering the potential risks and benefits of interventions, particularly in light of recent changes in donor demographics and increasing demand for organs. Overall, the review suggests that more rigorous and well-designed studies are needed to fully understand the efficacy and safety of interventions in deceased donors before organ transplantation."}

The incidence of liver disease\nhas risen by 500% over the last 4 decades, however, access to\ntransplantation is limited by the shortage of donor organs1. As a\nconsequence, 240 patients (19%) waiting for liver transplantation\nin the United Kingdom either died or were removed from the\nwaiting list in 2016–20172. Data from the United States shows a\nsimilar pattern, comprising 32% of those listed for transplant\n(3629 patients) within 3 years of listing2,3. The demand for liver\ngrafts has driven the wider use of extended criteria donors4.\nHowever, these are associated with an increased risk of primary\nnon-function or delayed failure5–9, and the acceptance of these\nhigher-risk organs varies widely10. Because of these inferior\noutcomes, and the difficulty of predicting organ viability, many\npotential donor organs remain unutilised. The high waiting list\nmortality justifies the utilisation of more marginal grafts, but\ncurrent practice requires risk mitigation by matching high-risk\nlivers to lower-risk recipients to achieve patient survival rates that\nare acceptable11. Furthermore, the determination of suitability of\na graft for transplantation largely depends on a surgeon’s sub￾jective assessment of the graft’s appearance, using criteria that are\nknown to be unreliable12.\nOrgan preservation currently relies upon cooling to ice tem￾perature to reduce cellular metabolism, and infusing specialist\nsolutions to limit cellular damage. Oxygen deprivation and accu￾mulation of by-products of anaerobic metabolism limit the dura￾tion of storage and result in ischaemia–reperfusion injury at the\ntime of implantation. This process is more severe in marginal\norgans13. Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) has been\nshown to reduce preservation-related graft injury compared to\nstatic cold storage in transplantable livers, according to current\nselection criteria, in a prospective European trial, which also\ndemonstrated increased utilisation of organs14. In NMP, the liver is\nsupplied with oxygen, nutrients and medication at physiological\ntemperature and pressures, maintaining conditions that support\nhomoeostasis, normal metabolic activity and objective assessment\nof function in real-time. Experimental data have shown that end￾ischaemic NMP facilitates replenishment of adenosine tripho￾sphate and glycogen levels. Based on increasing clinical experience,\nviability criteria have emerged; these are objective parameters,\nmeasurable during NMP15. Whilst the feasibility of this approach\nhas been demonstrated in a proof-of-concept series, it has not been\nvalidated in a rigorous clinical trial16,17.\nWe therefore conducted this prospective, non-randomised,\nadaptive phase 2 trial in a large single centre, to evaluate the\npotential of NMP to provide objective assessment of the viability\nof livers currently deemed unsuitable for transplantation, and to\ntransplant those that met predetermined criteria. The primary\nclinical objective underlying this project was the increased and\nsafe utilisation of livers which are currently discarded.\nThe trial demonstrates that viability testing with NMP is fea￾sible, and the objective assessment enables successful transplan￾tation of 71% of perfused discarded livers, with 100% 90-day\npatient and graft survival. The intervention does not seem to\nprevent the development of non-anastomotic biliary strictures in\nlivers donated after circulatory death (DCD) with prolonged\ndonor warm ischaemic times.\nResults\nCharacteristics of discarded liver offers and study participants.\nOver the 16-month study duration from November 2016 to\nFebruary 2018, there were 185 livers discarded for clinical use and\noffered for research. Characteristics of those offers and the study\ninclusion flowchart are provided in Fig. 1a, b.\nOne hundred and sixty-four patients on the waiting list were\napproached for potential participation, of which 53 were\nconsented, and 22 were enroled in the study and received rescued\ngrafts. The potential participants were counselled regarding the\nhigh-risk nature of the project and unknown long-term outcomes\nof resuscitated livers. As a consequence, a proportion of patients\nwere understandably reluctant to participate, and therefore the\nlack of suitable consented recipients was the principal rate limiting\nfactor for inclusion. The number of consented patients at any\ngiven time ranged from 1 to 9; the flow diagram displaying the\nprogress of patients through the trial is shown in Fig. 2.\nDonor liver characteristics and liver biopsy features. In 8 (26%)\ndonors the liver was the only procured organ. All discarded donor\nlivers entered in the study satisfied one or more of the inclusion\nhigh-risk criteria. The livers enroled in the trial consisted of 17\norgans donated after brainstem death (DBD) and 14 DCD. Many\nof these organs looked grossly suboptimal, with some degree of\nsteatosis, capsular fibrosis or rounded edges with multifactorial\nreasons for discard, that was captured by the donor risk index\n(DRI) > 2.0 in 22 (71%) livers, with the median DRI 2.2 (1.9–2.9).\nDetailed characteristics are shown in Table 1 and Supplementary\nTable 1. Photos of all included livers are presented in Fig. 3. The\ntransplanted livers were typically smaller than non-viable ones\n(1.7 vs. 2.0 kg, p = 0.015; Kruskal–Wallis test), with lower peak\npre-mortem donor liver enzyme levels. The median static cold\nstorage time before starting NMP was 7 h:44 min (6:29–10:25).\nOnly 3 (10%) livers were included in the trial primarily for\nmacrosteatosis >30%, (50%, 80% and 60% macrovesicular stea￾tosis combined with 11 h:55 min, 12 h:00 min and 6 h:15 min cold\nischaemia, respectively). Glycogen content and steatosis degree\ndid not predict the viability assessment results. The detailed\nhistological finding of each study liver is provided in Supple￾mentary Table 2.\nPerfusion parameters assessment. During the NMP procedure\n25 livers quickly recovered metabolic activity and cleared lactate\nto the target level (details provided in Fig. 4). A biopsy of a\nsuspicious donor colonic lesion confirmed malignancy, making\none liver unsuitable for transplantation, after meeting the viability\ncriteria. In three livers, criteria were initially met, however,\nmetabolic function thereafter deteriorated within the first 4 h,\nwith increasing lactate. In two cases the transplant procedure was\nnot commenced and the livers were discarded. In the third, the\nexplant had begun, and the procedure continued. Overall, 22\n(71%) livers met the viability criteria and were transplanted fol￾lowing a median total preservation time of 17 h:53 min\n(16:17–21:48; Table 2).\nThe study patients. The majority (64%) of recipients were men,\nand median age was 56 (46–65) years. The leading indication for\ntransplantation was alcohol-related liver disease (36%), followed\nby primary sclerosing cholangitis (27%) and non-alcoholic stea￾tohepatitis (18%). In three (14%) patients the underlying liver\ndisease was complicated by liver cancer. The median UKELD18\nscore was 52 (49–55), with a calculated laboratory MELD score of\n12 (9–16). Details are provided in Table 2 and Supplementary\nTable 3.\nCo-primary study outcomes. Thirty-one livers were enroled into\nthe trial for objective assessment by NMP. Twenty-two of these\nlivers met the viability criteria and were transplanted, resulting in\na significant successful rescue rate of 71% (22/31, 90% Wilson CI:\n56.3–82.2%), to conclude that the procedure is feasible.

Graft 90-day survival was 100%. Seven\n(32%) patients developed early allograft dysfunction, and 7 (32%)\npatients developed Clavien–Dindo complication grade ≥3,\nincluding 4 (18%) cases with acute kidney injury requiring renal\nreplacement therapy. The median intensive care and in-hospital\nstays were 3.5 days (3–4) and 10 days (8–17), respectively. The 1-\nyear patient and graft survival were 100% and 86%, respectively.\nDetails are provided in Table 3.\nVascular and biliary complications. One patient developed an\nintra-operative hepatic artery thrombosis after receiving a DBD\ngraft that had sustained a hepatic arterial injury during procure￾ment. The artery was reconstructed but post-operatively throm￾bosed, undergoing emergency revascularisation which achieved\nlong-lasting arterial patency. The graft, however, developed biliary\nstrictures requiring multiple interventions and eventual re￾transplantation.\nThe per-protocol magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatogra￾phy (MRCP) imaging at 6 months revealed that 2 (9%) patients\ndeveloped anastomotic, and 4 (18%) patients non-anastomotic\nbiliary strictures that presented with cholestatic symptoms. With\nthe exception of the patient with hepatic artery thrombosis, all\nbiliary strictures affected recipients of DCD grafts.

Over the\n16-month study period there were 185 discarded liver research offers, of which 59 (32%) were not eligible for the trial due to an incidental finding of\ncancer, macroscopically apparent cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis, severe organ damage or previous machine perfusion. There were 126 livers suitable for the\ntrial, with steatosis being the leading cause of organ discard with 78 (42%) offers. Stringent donor inclusion criteria were not met in 25 (14%) offers and on\n21 (11%) occasions the research team was already committed to the perfusion of another study liver. A liver was considered for the trial only if it could be\nallocated to a consented, potential blood group- and size-matched low-risk recipient. Many recipients were apprehensive to participate in such a high-risk\nclinical trial, and as a consequence, at any given time there were usually only one to three patients consented. A significant proportion of approached\npatients declined to take part, or were transplanted with a standard quality liver before agreeing to take part in this study. Eventually, thirty-one livers were\nenroled to the trial, of which 22 (71%) grafts met the viability criteria and were successfully transplanted. b A summary of reasons for livers being\ndiscarded in the United Kingdom between November 2016 and February 2018. A total of 64 livers were discarded for severe steatosis on visual\nassessment, with 14 discarded for severe steatosis based on urgent liver biopsy. A percentage of livers were declined due to intra-abdominal or lung\nmalignancies (e.g. colonic cancer in donor 22). This did not include primary brain tumours or small renal cell cancers which are almost always considered\nfor donation. The reasons for logistic discard, include the transplant team already being committed to one or more transplantations, lack of a suitable\nrecipient or too long an anticipated cold ischaemia time due to delays with transportation.\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16251-3 ARTICLE\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2020) 11:2939 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16251-3 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 3\n\nregression). There were no differences in the other assessed\nparameters, including the need for post-transplant renal repla￾cement therapy, hospital stay or incidence of Clavien–Dindo\ngrade ≥ 3 complication rates. The incidence of clinically manifest\nnon-anastomotic biliary strictures was higher in the study group\n(18% vs. 2%, odds ratio 8.0, 95% CI: 0.9–71.6; p = 0.063; condi￾tional logistic regression), although this result needs to be inter￾preted with caution as the matched control patients did not\nreceive systematic bile duct imaging. Due to the small sample\nsizes these comparison results should be interpreted with caution,\nand the controls were included to present the study results within\nthe context of the unit’s contemporary outcomes. The details are\nshown in Table 3.\nDiscussion\nUtilisation of livers from organ donors is currently a major\nchallenge in liver transplantation19. Despite a waiting list mor￾tality in Western countries reaching 20–30%, an increasing pro￾portion of extended criteria livers are unused due to concerns of\nprimary non-function and early graft dysfunction20,21. The\ndecision to discard donor livers is still largely based upon donor\nhistory and subjective assessment by the transplanting surgeon.\nStandard cold static preservation does not allow for any assess￾ment of liver function, and the only other source of information is\nliver histology, which is able to diagnose severe large droplet fatty\nchange, a well-recognised risk factor for non-function21. This\nstudy has demonstrated that moving from subjective evaluation\nto objective testing during NMP might salvage a high proportion\nof those livers that are currently discarded. The need to improve\nthe method by which high-risk livers are assessed was illustrated\nin this study by the absence of significant differences in the donor\ncharacteristics between transplanted and discarded livers.\nThe present trial is the first to systematically investigate\nobjective viability criteria in livers that met specific high-risk\nfeatures in organs initially considered “untransplantable”11,22.\nOne major challenge addressed in the VITTAL trial design was\nthat each discarded liver had to also fulfil one or more pre￾defined objective high-risk criteria, as the considerations for liver\ntransplantability are always multi-factorial, including the reci￾pientʼs condition, logistical aspects and the surgeon’s (or trans￾plant centre’s) experience and risk-taking attitude. The utilisation\nof marginal livers in the United Kingdom was facilitated by the\ncentre-based liver allocation system, allowing the use of high-risk\norgans in any patient on the waiting list. All enroled organs were\nsimultaneously fast-track offered to all UK transplant centres\nfollowing the initial decline, and the fact that none of the seven\ncentres were comfortable using any of the livers included in this\ntrial confirms that these organs were uniformly perceived to be of\nvery poor quality. Our team genuinely aimed to push the\nboundaries of utilisation of the highest risk organs by accessing\nParticipant\nenrollment\nAllocation\nFollow up\nAnalysis\nPatients on waiting list approached and\nassessed for eligibility (n = 164)\nExcluded (n = 111)\nMet exclusion criteria; not suitable for\nmarginal graft (n = 48)\nDeclined to take part (n = 22)\nTransplanted with standard livers prior\nto giving study consent (n = 41)\nConsented (n = 53)\nNo randomisation\nTransplanted with standard livers prior to being\noffered a rescued liver (n = 29)\nPatient remained on waiting list (n = 2)\nTransplanted with VITTAL rescued livers (n = 22)\nPassed stage 1 (3 successes/3 patients) and stage 2\n(11 successes/11 patients) interim assessments\nDiscontinued study following liver\nre-transplantation at day 225 (n = 1)\nTransplanted patients analysed for primary\noutcome (90-day survival) and short-term\nsecondary outcomes (n = 22)\nFig. 2 CONSORT flow diagram displaying the progress of patients through the trial. One hundred and sixty-four patients on the waiting list were\napproached for potential trial participation. Of those, 111 were excluded; 48 patients met exclusion criteria and were not suitable for a marginal liver graft.\nTwenty-two patients declined to take part and 41 patients either received a transplant before they provided study consent, or were de-listed, or\nsubsequently met exclusion criteria. Eventually 53 patients consented to the study, of which 29 underwent transplantation with a standard quality liver\nallocated outside the trial. Twenty-two patients were enroled in the trial and received a salvaged liver.\nARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16251-3\n4 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2020) 11:2939 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16251-3 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications\n\nthe benefit of rigorous peer-review and continual oversight within\nthe framework of a clinical trial. We included only organs that\nour team did not feel comfortable to use otherwise, and this\nattitude was reflected by the 2-tier liver inclusion process\nembedded in the trial design, and by the fact that 25 livers, that\nwould very likely meet the transplantability criteria, were not\nconsidered for study inclusion. Some of the study livers might\nhave been transplantable if the cold ischaemia was very short and\na suitable recipient was waiting, but currently the majority of\nthese organs are discarded. With the introduction of the National\nAllocation system, logistical constraints exacerbated by static cold\nstorage are increasingly common and prevent the utilisation of a\nrising proportion of marginal livers. In these circumstances, NMP\nmitigates the reperfusion process, allowing assessment of the\norgan during perfusion without exposing patients to the risk of\nprimary non-function. In addition, livers discarded due to hae￾modynamic instability (during procurement or during the pro￾cess of brain stem death itself), high liver transaminases or poor\nin situ flush, benefited from perfusion in a controlled, near\nphysiological environment thereby facilitating their recovery. The\npotential to recondition the liver in the interval between retrieval\nand implantation has hitherto not been possible.\nAn intervention which increases successful utilisation of high￾risk livers will transform access to transplantation to meet pre￾dicted increasing demand, particularly given trends in donor\ndemographics and declining organ quality4.

In 2017–2018, not only\nwere 174 retrieved livers discarded, but 425 livers from solid\norgan donors were not even considered suitable for retrieval (11%\nof DBD and 52% of DCD); it is reasonable to assume that many\nof these would be suitable for testing with NMP. Salvaging a\nproportion of these retrieved but discarded organs would add a\ngood number of transplantable livers annually in the UK, sig￾nificantly reducing waiting list mortality.\nInternational comparisons demonstrate regional variations in\ndonor demographics and there is evidence that in countries with\nhigher initial organ acceptance rates there is also a higher discard\nrate, particularly for older donors23,24. Viability testing provides\nobjective evidence of liver function with clearance of metabolic\nacidosis, vascular flows, glucose parameters and bile production;\nthese give the transplant surgeon the confidence to use these\norgans safely, and minimises the physical and emotional impact\nof non-transplantation for patients.\n1 2 3 4 5\n6 7 8 9 10\n11 12 13 14 15\n16 17 18 19 20\n21 22 23 24 25\n26 27 28 29 30\n31\nFig. 3 The study liver photographs.

Whilst this approach may\nsimplify adoption of the NMP technology without compromising\noutcomes in transplantable livers25, recovery of organs from\ndonors with multiple high-risk features might be further facili￾tated by limiting cold ischaemia through commencing the per￾fusion immediately after procurement in the donor hospital14.\nInevitably there will always be livers that are not suitable for\ntransplantation, demonstrated by 30% of offers with macroscopic\ncirrhosis, biopsy-proven fibrosis or an incidental finding of donor\ncancer. A similar proportion of the livers, however, did not meet\nany of our high-risk criteria and were therefore considered “too\ngood” for inclusion. It is reasonable to assume that NMP\nassessment would have provided the reassurance needed to justify\ntransplantation in this group as well.\nImprovements in transplant logistics is one of the major\nadvantages of NMP14,25,26, and the study allowed for the machine\nperfusion duration to be between 4 h (time needed for the via￾bility assessment) and 24 h (maximum recommended time by the\nperfusion device manufacturer). Once the liver met the viability\ncriteria we aspired to commence the transplantation as soon as\npossible; however, the perfusion was often extended to allow for a\nday-time procedure, or to facilitate transplant logistics in the unit.\nFrom our experience, 4–6 h perfusion seems to be sufficient for\nadequate assessment and replenishment of the organ’s energy\nresources. Due to recirculation of metabolites accumulated in the\norgans during cold ischaemia, the high-risk organs probably do\nnot benefit from prolonged perfusion. The impact of NMP\nduration on livers initially exposed to prolonged cold ischaemia is\nan area of our ongoing research interest.\nTransplant surgeons in many countries are expanding the\ndonor pool with the use of organs donated after circulatory\ndeath27. In the context of liver transplantation, the longevity of\nthese organs might be compromised by development of non￾anastomotic biliary strictures8. The incidence of clinically man￾ifest non-anastomotic biliary strictures in the DCD grafts cohort\nwas 30% (3 out of 10 grafts), higher than the study matched\ncontrols group, but similar to other reported high-risk DCD\nseries28. In concordance with the European prospective nor￾mothermic preservation trial, our results suggested that MRCP\nfindings are likely to over-estimate the incidence of biliary com￾plications14. The per-protocol investigation at the 6-month time\npoint would identify over 80% of the clinically relevant biliary\nstrictures and asymptomatic irregularities with varying clinical\nsignificance28. The presented findings are accurate, as the images\nwere correlated with clinical reviews and liver function tests\nthrough the median follow up of 542 (range: 390–784) days.\nNevertheless, it is clear that end-ischaemic NMP does not prevent\nthe development of non-anastomotic biliary strictures in high￾risk DCD organs, and our outcomes suggest that extending the\ndonor warm times beyond the currently widely accepted limit of\n30 min is not advisable. This finding was not anticipated at the\ntime of trial design or during the conduct of the trial and only\nbecame evident during the long-term follow up of these grafts\nbeyond the primary end point of 90 days.

Sub￾analysis of bile samples and determination of biliary endothelial\nhealth is the subject of ongoing research. Evolving novel perfu￾sion strategies might enable the use of DCD grafts exposed to\nprolonged warm ischaemia14,29,30.\nThe other limitations of our study include the sensitivity of the\ncut-off lactate value, the non-randomised trial design and exclu￾sion of high-risk transplant recipients. Regarding the former,\nfollowing previous experience, we set the lactate viability threshold\nto less than 2.5 mmol/L within 2 h of NMP15,16 To maximise\nutilisation, this trial extended the assessment period to 4 h. Two\nlivers in the trial were discarded following a rise of the perfusate\nlactate after meeting the 2-h target. The significance of this is\nuncertain, although it is notable that a third liver with a similar\npattern of lactate clearance was transplanted and experienced a\nsubstantial period of early allograft dysfunction with a post￾transplant peak ALT of 2074 IU and AST of 3031 IU. Concerning\nthe design, the trial was conducted as a non-randomised study, as\ntransplanting discarded livers with an expected high incidence of\nprimary non-function as controls would be ethically unacceptable.\nWe expect further advances to be achieved through the identifi￾cation of specific biomarkers that correlate with long-term graft\noutcomes, in the context of large NMP series or registries. Lastly,\nas we did not want to compound risks, the study did not include\nhigher risk recipients deemed not suitable to receive marginal\norgans at the unit’s multi-disciplinary liver transplant listing\nmeeting. The majority of participants who decided to participate\ndid so after a long period waiting on the list, with progressive\ndeterioration that was not necessarily reflected by their waiting list\nposition. The feasibility of using livers rescued by NMP for the\nhigh-risk recipient is currently under investigation.\nIn conclusion, this trial demonstrated that NMP provides a\nway of objectively assessing high-risk organs, and allowed\ntransplantation in a significant proportion of currently unutilised\nlivers without any incidence of primary non-function. The use of\nperfusion technology was associated with increased graft utilisa￾tion, considerably extended preservation time and greatly\nimproved transplant logistics. Adoption of functional assessment\nof high-risk livers can increase access to life saving transplanta￾tion and reduce waiting list mortality.\nMethods\nStudy design. This study was a prospective, open label, phase 2 adaptive single￾arm trial comprising high-risk livers meeting two-tier inclusion criteria. The first￾tier was being considered as unsuitable for transplant by all UK transplant centres\nwithin a nationwide fast-track offering scheme. The trial was performed at a single￾institution (Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, UK) with experience in NMP\nand utilisation of high-risk grafts5,31. The second-tier eligibility required at least\none of seven specific criteria that confirmed the high-risk status of every enroled\nliver (Table 4). To minimise risks of high post-transplant complications or mor￾tality for the study participants, the trial used an adaptive design with two interim\nsafety analyses (Supplementary Fig. 1). The study design and conduct complied\nwith all relevant regulations regarding the use of human study participants. The\ntrial was funded by the Wellcome Trust, and granted approval by the National\nResearch Ethics Service in London-Dulwich (REC reference 16/LO/1056, Protocol\nnumber RG 15–240) and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory\nAgency and the University Hospitals Birmingham Research and Development\nDepartment. The project was endorsed by the Research, Innovation and Novel\nTechnologies Advisory Group committee of the National Health Service Blood and\nTransplant. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (reference number\nNCT02740608), the protocol has been published32, and the full version is provided\nin the Supplementary Information.\nDiscarded liver inclusion criteria and the study logistics. The study considered\nall potential donors with a diagnosis of brainstem death or Maastricht category III\nand IV donors after circulatory death, aged up to 85 years, initially retrieved with\nthe intent for transplantation but subsequently declined by all UK transplant\ncentres based on the retrieving or transplant surgeon’s assessment. If our centre\nwas the last in the fast-track offering sequence, the liver had to be deemed\nuntransplantable by two consultant surgeons independently. The surgeons were\npaired together to create an overall low threshold for using marginal livers,\nensuring any liver that could be used without viability testing was transplanted,\nthereby minimising bias. For the liver to be eligible it also had to meet at least one\ndefined high-risk criterion (see Tables 1 and 4). Consent for research was provided\nby the donor’s next of kin.\nStudy participants. Eligible participants were those listed electively for primary\nliver transplantation and deemed to be low-to-moderate transplant risk candidates,\nsuitable to receive a high-risk graft, as assessed by the unit’s transplant waiting list\nmulti-disciplinary team. Candidates were required to have a patent portal vein, no\nsignificant comorbidities (cardiovascular diseases, including active angina, a history\nof ischaemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular events, symp￾tomatic valvular heart disease or cardiac arrhythmias; pulmonary conditions\nincluding pulmonary hypertension or established diagnosis of pulmonary dys￾function), a UK end-stage liver disease18 (UKELD) score ≤62 and no history of\nmajor upper abdominal surgery. Each participant was fully informed of being\noffered a marginal graft and gave written consent for the trial in advance of the\norgan offer, after having at least 24 h to consider their participation.\nThe study intervention and liver viability assessment. All livers were cold￾preserved with University of Wisconsin solution and commenced NMP using the\nOrganOx Metra™ device after arrival at the transplant centre. The protocol stipu￾lated an NMP duration of between 4 and 24 h. Serial perfusate, bile and tissue\nsamples were taken at regular time intervals. For a liver to be considered viable it\nhad to metabolise perfusate lactate to levels ≤2.5 mmol/L within 4 h of commen￾cing the perfusion, in addition to meeting at least 2 of the following additional\ncriteria: evidence of bile production, maintenance of perfusate pH ≥ 7.30, meta￾bolism of glucose, maintenance of stable arterial and portal flows (≥150 and\n≥500 mL/min, respectively), and homogenous perfusion with soft consistency of\nthe parenchyma16.\nIf a liver was considered viable, the transplant was set up and performed. At the\npoint of recipient hepatectomy, the NMP team disconnected the organ from the\ndevice, flushed it with 3 l of histidine–tryptophan–ketoglutarate solution at 4 °C\nand handed it over for immediate implantation. Post-transplant management\nfollowed the unit’s standard protocol, with immunosuppression comprising\ntacrolimus, azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil and low-dose steroids. Each\npatient underwent an MRCP at 6 months unless the investigation was clinically\nindicated earlier.\nLiver quality was determined retrospectively through histological analysis of\nparenchymal biopsies which were assessed for pre-existing liver disease, steatosis,\nglycogen content and features of preservation–reperfusion injury.\n1.00\nKaplan–Meier 1 year graft survival estimates\n0.75\n0.50\n0.25\n0.00\n0\nNumber at risk\nCase–Control = Control 37\nCase–Control = Case\n3\n34 30 27 23\n22 21 20 20\n6\nTime post-transplant (Months)\n9 12\nGraft survival probability\n22\nControls Case\nFig. 5 Comparison of 1-year graft survival estimate.

Due to the small sample sizes and that this\nstatistical comparison test was not powered,these results should be\ninterpreted with caution.\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16251-3 ARTICLE\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2020) 11:2939 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16251-3 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 9\n\nOutcome measures. The co-primary outcomes consisted of (A) feasibility of NMP\nin discarded organ recovery and (B) achievement of successful transplantation. The\nperfused organ recovery rate was the proportion of perfusions leading to trans￾plantation. Successful transplantation was defined as 90-day patient survival—a\nnationally accepted, monitored and continuously audited outcome measure.\nThe key secondary outcome measures included assessment of the liver graft\nfunction (by incidence of primary non-function and early allograft dysfunction33)\nliver function test results, 90-day graft survival, intensive therapy unit and post￾transplant in-hospital stays, incidence of vascular complications, and anastomotic\nand non-anastomotic biliary strictures as assessed by MRCP at 6 months.\nPerioperative data collection included haemodynamic stability, incidence of post￾reperfusion syndrome and blood-product requirements. Post-transplant adverse\nevents and complication severity were graded according to the Clavien–Dindo\nclassification34. The secondary outcomes were compared with contemporary\ncontrols (1:2), matched in order of priority for the donor graft type, UKELD Score,\ndonor age and donor sex only. Four variables included in the original protocol\n(model of end-stage liver disease [MELD], recipient age, BMI and the liver disease\naetiology) were removed as matching criteria due to confounding correlation and\nbeing overly stringent. No recipient suffered from recurrent disease during the\nstudy follow-up period. The matching criteria used identified 39 patients. There\nwas consistency in the recipient selection for high-risk grafts guided by the unit’s\nprotocols and transplant waiting list multi-disciplinary team meetings that assured\nsimilar characteristics regarding the cardiovascular comorbidities and surgical risks\nin the study participants and the matched controls. The pre-planned comparisons\nwith the matched controls group were not powered to demonstrate any differences.\nDue to the small sample sizes, these results should be interpreted with caution; the\ncontrols were included to present the study results within the context of the unit’s\ncontemporary outcomes.\nStatistical analysis. The trial was powered with an emphasis on (A) the feasibility\nof the intervention using NMP and (B) recipient safety. In terms of the intervention\nfeasibility (A), the aim was to achieve an organ recovery rate of at least 50%, with a\nrate of 30% or less being considered unacceptable. Using a two-stage design35, with\nan interim assessment after 24 livers (continuing if ≥8 livers were recovered), a\nsample size of up to 53 livers undergoing NMP might be required, with target alpha\n(one-sided) of 0.05 (actual alpha = 0.047) and target beta of 0.1 (actual\nbeta = 0.098). NMP was considered feasible for organ recovery if at least 22 livers\nwere recovered from 53 perfused. Though the two statistical inferences are asses￾sing different hypotheses (safety and feasibility), they are linked as 22 transplants\nare required for the safety testing of the procedure, which is also the minimum\nnumber required out of 53 perfused livers to be considered feasible.\nFor (B), the mean 90-day patient survival rate for patients receiving liver\ntransplants in the United Kingdom was 93%36. For the discarded livers, the\ndesirable and undesirable 90-day overall survival rates were set at 88% and 73%\n(15% lower), respectively. Using an optimal three-stage adaptive design37 with two\ninterim assessments after 3 patients (requires ≥ 2 successes) and 11 patients\n(≥8 successes), a sample size of 22 patients was required, with alpha (type I error)\nand beta (type II error) of 0.2. As this was an early phase (non-definitive) trial to\nassess the safety of this procedure, a relaxed one-sided alpha was used to attain an\nachievable sample size within the trial duration and cost constraint. The approach\nwas considered successful if there were at least 18 successes out of 22 transplants.\nThe descriptive statistics data were presented as number and percentages, and\nmedian and interquartile range. Due to small numbers, the pre-planned analyses\nused Kruskal–Wallis test to assess differences in continuous variables between two\ngroups and Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. Kaplan–Meier survival\nmethod was used to analyse time-to-event data and conditional logistic regression\nfor matched case–control analysis. All secondary and exploratory analyses were\nTable 4 Study inclusion and criteria.\nGraft inclusion criteria 1.

The study enrolled 31 livers from 22 high-risk donors, and 22 of them met the viability criteria and were successfully transplanted, resulting in a 100% survival rate at day 90 post-transplantation. The study found that NMP is a feasible method for improving the viability and transplantation success rate of high-risk livers. The study also identified that all four patients who experienced biliary complications after transplantation had received livers from donors after brainstem death (DBD), while none of the control group patients who received livers from DBD donors experienced biliary complications. The study suggests that NMP may be particularly beneficial for livers from DBD donors, as they often exhibit poor quality due to warm ischemia time. The study highlights the importance of considering the type of donor when evaluating the risks and benefits of NMP for high-risk livers. The study also acknowledges the support and contributions of various individuals and organizations, including the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Birmingham Biomedical Research Centre, the British Transplant Society, and the local public and patient involvement group. The study was funded by the Wellcome Trust, and the authors declare no competing interests. The study provides evidence for the effectiveness of NMP in improving the viability and transplantation success rate of high-risk livers, particularly for livers from DBD donors, and emphasizes the importance of considering the type of donor when evaluating the risks and benefits of NMP."}

Contraindications for donation\nhave been revised in order to better meet the organ demand. The use of lower-quality\norgans and organs with greater preoperative damage, including those from donation after\ncardiac death (DCD), has become an established routine but increases the risk of graft\nmalfunction. This risk is further aggravated by ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI) in the\nprocess of transplantation. These circumstances demand a preservation technology that\nameliorates IRI and allows for assessment of viability and function prior to transplantation.\nOxygenated hypothermic and normothermic machine perfusion (MP) have emerged\nas valid novel modalities for advanced organ preservation and conditioning. Ex vivo\nprolonged lung preservation has resulted in successful transplantation of high-risk\ndonor lungs. Normothermic MP of hearts and livers has displayed safe (heart) and\nsuperior (liver) preservation in randomized controlled trials (RCT). Normothermic kidney\npreservation for 24 h was recently established. Early clinical outcomes beyond the market\nentry trials indicate bioenergetics reconditioning, improved preservation of structures\nsubject to IRI, and significant prolongation of the preservation time. The monitoring\nof perfusion parameters, the biochemical investigation of preservation fluids, and the\nassessment of tissue viability and bioenergetics function now offer a comprehensive\nassessment of organ quality and function ex situ. Gene and protein expression profiling,\ninvestigation of passenger leukocytes, and advanced imaging may further enhance the\nunderstanding of the condition of an organ during MP. In addition, MP offers a platform\nfor organ reconditioning and regeneration and hence catalyzes the clinical realization\nof tissue engineering. Organ modification may include immunological modification and\nthe generation of chimeric organs. While these ideas are not conceptually new, MP\nnow offers a platform for clinical realization. Defatting of steatotic livers, modulation\nof inflammation during preservation in lungs, vasodilatation of livers, and hepatitis C\nelimination have been successfully demonstrated in experimental and clinical trials.\nTargeted treatment of lesions and surgical treatment or graft modification have been\nattempted. In this review, we address the current state of MP and advanced organ\nmonitoring and speculate about logical future steps and how this evolution of a novel\ntechnology can result in a medial revolution.\nKeywords: transplantation, machine perfusion, marginal, graft, immunogenecity, immunomodulation,\nreconditioning, expanded criteria donor\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nINTRODUCTION\nThe velocity and significance of progress in transplantation\nstarted to decrease around the turn of the century. Up until\nthat point, the number of transplantations performed was\never-increasing, and the outcomes continued to improve. The\nclinical benefit to the patient from the immediate and effective\ntreatment of organ failure was defined by improved patient\nsurvival. Patient survival as an endpoint followed by graft survival\nas a surrogate and indicator of judicious organ attribution\nwere the framework of significant momentum that succeeded\nin making transplantation a standard of care. This success\nwas fueled, however, not only by the healthcare quality gain\nbut also by a flourishing industry producing high-quality and\nexpensive immunosuppressive medication—to be taken for life\nafter transplantation (1–3).\nThe honeymoon period came to an end when both donor\nrates and short-term results stagnated. The established endpoints\nfor clinical trials are difficult to improve in the short run\nafter transplantation, and the field was slow in anticipating\nand responding to the changing circumstances—specifically\nthe shortage of standard criteria donors (SCD). The field of\ntransplantation now finds itself in very difficult circumstances:\n90%+ patient and graft survival rates leave little room for\nimprovement but also little room for error. At the same\ntime, the conditions and circumstances in organ donation are\nradically changing, with increasing donor age and comorbidities\nand donation from non-heart-beating donors. In countries\nspearheading the evolution, donation after cardiac death (DCD)\nand extended criteria donor (ECD) organs make up more than\n50% of the organ pool. With the pressure to maintain and further\nimprove the excellent short- and long-term results, but working\nwith very different resources, the most prominent immediate\nchallenge is to better define and preserve, if not improve, organ\nquality in transplantation.\nAbbreviations: A2AR, Adenosine A2A receptor; AST, Aspartate\naminotransferase; ATP, Adenosine triphosphate; CIT, Cold ischemia time;\nCMV, Cytomegalovirus; CVA, Cerebrovascular accident; DAMP, Danger￾associated molecular pattern; DBD, Donation after brain death; DC, Dendritic\ncell; DCD, Donation after cardiac death; DGF, Delayed graft function;\nD-HOPE, Dual hypothermic oxygenated perfusion; DRI, Donor Risk Index;\nEAD, Early allograft dysfunction; ECD, Expanded criteria donor; ECMO,\nExtracorporal membrane oxygenation; EMS, Exsanguinous metabolic support;\nESP, Eurotransplant senior program; ET-1, Endothelin-1; EVLP, Ex vivo lung\nperfusion; FABP, Fatty Acid- Binding Protein 1; GFP, Green fluorescent protein;\nGST, Glutathione S-Tranferases; H-FABP, Heart-type fatty acid-binding protein;\nHOPE, Hypothermic oxygenated perfusion; HMP, Hypothermic machine\nperfusion; HMPO, Oxygenated hypothermic machine perfusion; IFNγ, Interferon\ngamma; IL-10, Interleukin-10; IRI, Ischemia-reperfusion injury; KDRI, Kidney\nDonor Risk Index; LDH, Lactate dehydrogenase; MP, Machine perfusion; MSC,\nMesenchymal stromal cells; NAG, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase; NMP,\nNormothermic machine perfusion; NK, Natural killer cell; NKT, Natural killer\nT cell; NRP, Normothermic regional perfusion; OCS, Transmedic Organ Care\nSystem; PDR, Pancreas Donor Risk Index; PGD3, Prostaglandin D3; PNF, Primary\nnon-function; PV, Pressure volume; RCT, Randomized controlled trial; ROS,\nReactive oxygen species; SCD, Standard criteria donor; SCS, Static cold storage;\nSOFT, Survival Outcomes Following Liver Transplantation score; SOP, Standard\noperating procedure; SOT, Solid organ transplantation; TNF-α, Tumor necrosis\nfactor α; UNOS, United Network for Organ Sharing; VEGF, Vascular endothelial\ngrowth factor; WIT, Warm ischemia time.\nWith this as a driving force, modalities to prolong and\nimprove preservation together with the tools to assess organ\nquality and function are emerging as the new frontier. Beyond\nserving an immediate medical need, the technologies evolving\nherald a more fundamental potential for change in healthcare:\nwith the extracorporeal long-term preservation and assessment\nof organs, the capability for human organ treatment and repair\narises. Hence, 20 years after transplantation advanced to become\na standard of care, the field has the potential to play a key role and\nadd a chapter to healthcare once again (4–10).\nIn this review, we aim to address the current state of the\nfield. A clarification of the terminology and the definitions\nof marginal organs, including an overview and comparison\nbetween the definitions for each organ, shall help to provide\na better picture of the actual status. Considering the changing\ncircumstances, the actual impacts of a condition on organ quality\nand function need to be addressed not only from the viewpoint\nof an empirical correlation. The individual parameters need to be\nfurther addressed for their reversibility and treatability. Building\non this concept, the various modalities of MP in their different\nstages of development and actual benefit require a critical\nreflection. While the assessment of organ quality and function\nduring extracorporeal perfusion is in its infancy, the growing\nbody of data may help to eventually develop a comprehensive\npicture of the quality of the components of organs as relevant to\ntransplantation and beyond. An important focus in this context\nis the assessment, definition, and relevance of the immune system\nof organs if isolated from the human body. Immunomodulation\nand immunomasking seem more realistic if attempted under\nthe conditions of an isolated and perfused organ. The vision\nof a realization and refinement of the repair, treatment, and\nmodification of organs is starting to trigger a boost in interest\nboth in academia and in industry.\nDEFINING “MARGINAL” ORGANS\nIn the light of organ shortage, critical reflection on the expansion\nof the donor pool is essential. The definition of organs that are\nmarginal for transplantation is often considered a well-defined\nentity. In reality, however, the definition is very different for each\norgan, and there is incongruence between the various definitions.\nIt is clear and well-justifiable that different organs are considered\nto be extended criteria organs going by different criteria, since the\nrelevance of one single factor may be very diverse. The assessment\nof the outcome after transplantation of extended criteria organs,\nhowever, needs to be seen and interpreted with reference to the\ndiverse definitions used throughout the years.\nECD Kidneys\nThe determination of ECD evolved from the term “marginal\ndonors,” and much of the literature focuses on criteria for living\ndonors. Since this is not the focus of this article, we will restrict\nthe research to deceased donors and deceased donor organs.\nIt is well-known that a number of factors may impact\nthe eventual outcome after transplantation. The definition of\ncadaveric kidney organs marginal for transplantation emerged\nfrom prioritization of and preference for factors that may outrank\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 2 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al.

In the deceased donor situation, the prior medical history\nis not completely known, and the exact determination of\nhypertension, for example, often remains incomplete regarding\ndetails such as manifestation, duration, or response to treatment.\nSome of the understanding of donor risk factors also stems from\nliving donors (12), where early definitions of marginal donors\nrelate to the risks for the recipient rather than the risk for the\ndonor, which was only assessed and understood much later.\nHence, the definition of marginal or ECD kidneys needs to be\nused with caution since the definitions used are building on a set\nof parameters that have not been formally established, validated,\nand re-validated.\nStill, compared to other organ systems in SOT, a comparatively\ngood definition of marginal or ECD has been established.\nNoteworthily, the term “marginal” should be avoided in favor of\nECD, as “marginal” may be considered pejorative by the patients\nwho receive them and also by the programs that transplant\nthem (13).\nThe ECD criteria most widely used in kidney transplantation\nare the OPTN-approved criteria, as described by Metzger et al.\n(13). They are shown in Table 1.\nA helpful tool that combines such parameters is the Kidney\nDonor Risk Index (KDRI), which was generated by weighting the\nfollowing factors into a single number in order to predict the risk\nof post-transplant graft failure: age, weight, height, race, history\nof hypertension, history of diabetes, cause of death, hepatitis C\nstatus, serum creatinine, and DCD. The association of KDRI\nwith the outcome in the Eurotransplant senior program (ESP)\nwas evaluated by Schamberger et al. (14). Kidney transplantation\nfrom Maastricht category-III donors after circulatory death\n(DCD), which introduces a higher risk of primary non-function\nand delayed graft function (DGF), has been added to ECD\ncriteria (15). Furthermore, kidneys from a donor with an acute\nkidney injury before organ procurement correspond to marginal\nquality (16). Importantly, kidneys from donors with a history\nof extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have not been\naddressed specifically but can be classified as marginal organs\nsince deteriorated microperfusion can be assumed (17–19).\nTABLE 2 | Common criteria defining “marginal” or “expanded criteria donor\n(ECD)” livers, as well as “ECD DCD” livers.\nDBD\nCardiac arrest (min) >15\nProlonged hypotensive periods <60 mmHg for >1 hr\nAge (yrs) >55\nBMI (kg/m2\n) >30\nHBV Positive\nHBC Positive\nBMI (kg/m2\n) 79 (100.0)\nMacrosteatosis (%) >30\nHypernatriemia (mEq/L) >155\nICU stay (days) ≥ 5 (mechanical ventilation)\nNosocomial infection Positive blood cultures or pneumonia\nSplit liver yes\nAST (U/L) >170\nALT (U/L) >140\nCIT (hrs) >12\nVasopressor drug requirement Dopamine dose >10 µg/kg/min or\nany doses of other amines)\nNon-heart-beating Yes\nDCD\nAge (yrs) >50\nBMI (kg/m2\n) >35\nFunctional WIT (min) >30\nMacrosteatosis (%) >30\nDCD, donation after cardiac death; DBD, donation after brain death; min, minutes; yrs,\nyears; hrs, hours; CIT, cold ischemia time; HBV, hepatitis B virus; HCV, hepatitis C\nvirus; BMI, body mass index; ICU, intensive care unit; AST, aspartate aminotransferase;\nALT, Alanin-aminotransferase.\nECD Livers\nIn liver transplantation, the term “marginal” does not refer to\na number of distinct internationally accepted criteria that could\ncharacterize a graft, and nor does “ECD.” Instead, both terms\nencompass a variety of factors that have been observed to limit\ngraft quality, but the impact of each of these factors remains\nto be defined. Therefore, several models for the assessment of\nthe sum of such risk factors have been introduced (20). In this\nregard, valuable predictive quality of patient and graft survival at\n3 months was achieved using the Survival Outcomes Following\nLiver Transplantation (SOFT) score (21). Death censored graft\nsurvival at 60 months follow-up was well-predicted by the Donor\nRisk Index (DRI; c-index 0.59) and Eurotransplant-DRI (c-index\n0.58) (20).\nTable 2 lists those criteria that overlap in the mentioned\nscoring systems and that are widely applied when defining\n“marginal” or “ECD” liver grafts (22, 23). Apart from clinical and\nmetric parameters, these include histological criteria, since liver\nbiopsies are considered helpful in order to evaluate the organ\nquality. Whereas, liver fibrosis has been reported to predict a\nhigh incidence of early graft failure (24), Liu et al. (25) suggested\na macrovesicular steatosis of 30 percent as a cutoff value for\nmarginal grafts.\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 3 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al.

Table 3 summarizes\nthe criteria that have been commonly used by various authors\n(27–30). In an attempt to bring such criteria into a clinically\nuseful context, Axelrod et al. (31) presented a Pancreas Donor\nRisk Index (PDR). The score builds a prediction model of graft\nsurvival on donor factors together with ischemia time and type\nof transplantation (31).\nECD Hearts\nDue to the imminent gap between the supply of donor hearts\nand the demand for transplantable organs, strategies have\nemerged to overcome this clinical dilemma. The numbers of left\nventricular assist devices as bridge-to-transplant therapy have\nsignificantly increased over the last decade. Simultaneously with\nthis trend, marginal or “extended criteria” hearts are routinely\nevaluated in order to increase the donor pool. While standardized\ncriteria have not been published by societies so far, there is a\ngeneral consensus when it comes to the definition of marginal\ndonor hearts. The literature on this topic is primarily driven\nby US data. A Meeting Report by the American Society on\nTransplantation on adult cardiac transplantation is still lacking\na unified formal definition.\nTABLE 5 | Common criteria defining standard criteria (SCD), therefore not ECD\nlung.\nAge (yrs) <55\nBMI mismatch donor/recipient (%) >20\nClear chest X-ray Yes\nPaO2 (mm Hg) >300 (FIO2 1.0,\nPEEP 5 mm Hg)\nHistory of smoking (pack yrs) <20\nAbsence of chest trauma Yes\nAbsence of microbiologic organisms endobronchial Yes\nAbsence of malignancy Yes\nAbsence of purulent secretions or signs of aspiration\nendobronchial\nYes\nNegative virology Yes\nyrs, years; BMI, body mass index; FIO2, fraction of inspired oxygen; PaO2, partial pressure\nof oxygen; PEEP, positive end-expiratory pressure.\nBased on the current literature, the factors that should be\nconsidered as extended criteria in heart donation are given in\nTable 4.\nIn order to facilitate a better risk-assessment of allografts,\ndonor profiles have been implemented in Risk Scores. Smits et al.\nhave identified 12 variables associated with donor non-use in\nthe Eurotransplant region and have generated the Eurotransplant\nHeart Donor Score (32). Based on the UNOS database, a risk\nscore model (UNOS Donor Risk Score) has been developed by\nWeiss et al. (33).\nECD Lungs\nBased on the standard criteria donor lung definitions published\nin 2003 by Orens et al. (34), one can define an ECD lung if\nthe donor does not fulfill at least one criterion of the SCD\ncriteria suggested by the International Society for Heart and Lung\nTransplantation (Table 5).\nMACHINE PERFUSION\nThe concept of MP was part of organ preservation long before\nsolid organ transplantation (SOT) started to become a clinical\nreality and routine. With the publication by Collins et al., in\nwhich the authors described a method for the transportation of\nkidneys on ice using a preservation solution with the result that\nthe organs could be shipped in a small box and showed almost\nno damage after 30 h, the era of static cold storage (SCS) had\nbegun (35). The implementation of SCS led to satisfactory results\nwithin the entire field of SOT. However, with the increasing\nuse of organs procured from ECD and DCD, SCS alone is not\nable to deliver the post-transplant results we aim to achieve for\nour patients. The lack of oxygen, the continuation of anaerobic\nmetabolism leading to organ-damage and recipient-harming\nIRI after reperfusion, is significantly pronounced and more\ndetrimental in these marginal donor organs (36).\nFigure 1 illustrates the different possibilities for combining\nall preservation techniques available today clinically for almost\nall organs: static cold storage (as the golden standard,\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 4 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nFIGURE 1 | The past, present, and potential (near) future of organ preservation. Whereas, static cold storage (SCS) has been successfully applied over decades with\ngood outcomes in standard criteria donor (SCD) organs, at present, marginal or expanded criteria donor (ECD) organs in particular are increasingly preserved by\nhypothermic (HMP) or normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) technologies. After initial cold perfusion [*and optimally following normothermic regional perfusion\n(NRP) in Donation after cardiac death (DCD) organs], machine perfusion is commenced either at the retrieval center or at the transplant center in a “back to hub”\napproach. The next step is to effectively use the prolonged preservation times of ECD grafts achieved by optimized machine perfusion protocols to characterize ECD\norgan quality and transplantability via the assessment of biomarkers. To improve graft quality, NMP provides an ideal platform for future immunomodulatory\nmodifications and organ repair.\nso far), hypothermic preservation with/without oxygen, and\nnormothermic perfusion. Normothermic regional perfusion\n(NRP) is mentioned in Figure 1, as it has become an important\ntool for use before the procurement process of DCD starts. The\nfollowing sections will not present NRP data in particular, as the\nreview is about machine preservation in marginal donor organs.\nHowever, good and satisfying results after kidney, pancreas,\nheart, and liver transplantation were reported by several groups\nin the United Kingdom, Spain, and France and have been\nsummarized by previous reviews (37–42).\nRecently, Ruiz et al. presented a series of 46 livers transplanted\nafter NRP and concluded that their results, including 23%\nearly allograft dysfunction, are superior to standard DCD organ\nprocurements and comparable to donation after brain death\n(DBD) results (43). The Cambridge group (United Kingdom),\nclear NRP proponents, commented on this publication in a way\nsimilar to our suggestions illustrated in Figure 1. The publication\nby Ruiz et al. (43), like many others before it, did not compare the\nresults to an adequate prospectively organized control group.\nIt is noteworthy that, only recently, a protocol for NRP\nwas established even for DCD heart transplantation. Due to a\nrestoration of function of the arrested heart, organ assessment via\nechocardiography, pressure-volume loops, and cardiac-output\nmeasurements could be implemented (44).\nAccepted criteria for subsequent heart transplantation after\nweaning from mechanical support are defined as: cardiac\nindex >2.5 L/min/m2\n; central venous pressure < 12 mm Hg;\npulmonary capillary wedge pressure < 12 mm Hg; left ventricular\nejection fraction > 50% in transoesophageal echocardiography.\nNRP leads to a meaningful increment of survival benefits and\nhelps to enlarge the available donor pool by utilizing marginal\ndonor organs in a safe way (45, 46). Future trials are needed to\ncompare DCD organ transplantation +/– NRP followed by +/–\na combination of preservation techniques (42, 45).\nSince 2009, dynamic cold storage—hypothermic machine\nperfusion (HMP)—has progressed to become clinical routine in\nseveral fields of SOT—above all, in kidney preservation. Moers\net al. published their landmark paper in the New England Journal\nof Medicine and demonstrated a significantly lowered DGF\nrate in recipients receiving a hypothermically perfused kidney\ncompared to a renal graft stored on ice in the common way\n(47). Applying the same technology (HMP without supplemental\noxygenation), numerous publications on DCD and ECD kidneys\nhave followed over the past 10 years, showing similar results:\nECD and DCD kidneys and their recipients clearly benefit from\nMP as long as the duration of cold ischemia time (CIT) is\nreasonable (48–52). During the second half of the recent decade,\noxygen as a supplement has been focused on for kidney HMP.\nIn 2016, Jochmans et al. published an overview of ongoing\nMP trials in kidney and liver transplantation, including those\nassessing oxygenated HMP (53). One of these trials run by the\nCOPE\nR\nconsortium (http://cope-eu.com/work%20programme/\ntrials.html) has finished recruiting, and 1-year-follow-up results\nwere presented during the American Transplant Congress 2019.\nThis international RCT on oxygenated HMP of DCD kidneys\nincluded 197 kidney pairs, of which 106 were successfully\nhypothermically perfused and transplanted. Approximately 80%\nof the transplanted kidney pairs were eligible for the primary\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 5 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nanalysis and resulted in a similar eGFR at 1 year after transplant\nfor oxygenated (HMPO) and standard HMP. Analysis of all￾cause graft failure, however, showed a higher eGFR in HMPO\nthan in HMP. Overall graft loss was significantly lower in HMPO,\nleading the authors to suggest that HMPO improves 1-year\nkidney graft function when accounting for the beneficial effect\non allograft survival.\nIn contrast, in the field of pancreas transplantation,\ndynamic preservation technologies have not yet experienced\na breakthrough. Neither hypothermic nor NMP technologies\nare well-established, and SCS remains the standard procedure.\nA recent review outlined nine studies on HMP and 10 studies\non NMP. All of them were experimental; none of the human\npancreatic grafts were transplanted. However, the common\nconclusion of all of the published articles considered was that\nIRI, thrombosis, and morbidity after whole organ pancreas\ntransplantation might be reduced by both technologies (54–56).\nLiver transplantation can be regarded as the field in SOT that\nprimarily focuses on the development of preservation techniques,\ncurrently. The most commonly used perfusion types in the\ndaily routine are HOPE (hypothermic oxygenated perfusion),\nD-HOPE (d for dual oxygenation via hepatic artery and portal\nvein), and normothermic liver preservation. HOPE and D￾HOPE studies have produced promising results, showing higher\nadenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels during preservation, less\nIRI, excellent graft survival after DCD liver transplantation,\nand a significantly reduced rate of bile duct injuries (57–60).\nThe Birmingham group was the first to publish its experiences\non livers undergoing HOPE and NMP consecutively (61).\nAlthough such livers were not transplanted, HOPE/NMP livers\ndeveloped less oxidative injury and inflammation and achieved\nenhanced metabolic recovery compared to livers undergoing\nNMP only (61). Liver NMP had its great appearance when the\nfirst prospective international multicenter RCT was published in\nApril 2018 (62). The trial on DBD and DCD livers with NMP\ndurations up to 24 h could show a significantly lower level of graft\ninjury, measured by reduced peak aspartate aminotransferase\n(AST), longer preservation times, and a 50% lower discard rate of\norgans compared to SCS. Bile duct complications and graft and\npatient survival were comparable in both groups (62).\nNMP has been shown to be beneficial in terms of immediate\ngraft function in all organ types in which it has been explored\nclinically: this includes the kidney (63–65), liver (62, 66), and\nthe lung (67, 68). The mechanism by which this occurs has not\nyet been conclusively proven, but the concept is that reperfusion\n(rewarming and oxygen delivery) in the artificial context of the\nperfusion circuit is beneficial by allowing recovery of cellular\nenergetics in the absence of the effector mechanisms needed for\nan acute inflammatory response (as in ischemia-reperfusion).\nORGAN PRESERVATION VS. ORGAN\nCONDITIONING VS. ORGAN REPAIR\nWith a new technology, the accompanying terminology is often\nsomewhat unspecific and unprecise in the beginning. This also\napplies to MP. It is paramount, however, to eventually clarify the\nterminology and define a uniformity for its correct use. Simply\nput, no other terminology than organ preservation would be\njustified at this point in the clinical application, since no targeted\nmeans for organ reconditioning (let alone repair) have been\nestablished. While this remains a glorious goal for the future,\nit also represents a significant legal and ethical challenge, since\nthe framework for the treatment of human organs remains to\nbe established. It remains entirely unclear whether extracorporal\norgan reconditioning and/or repair can be achieved. The hope\nand the hype are building on a growing body of experimental\ndata that indicates the feasibility of success or organ-specific\ntreatment. While this remains a most significant opportunity for\nthe field, we herein aim to adequately define organ preservation,\norgan (re-)conditioning, and organ treatment.\nOrgan Preservation—A Definition\nIt is interesting to note that no entry exists on organ preservation\nin Wikipedia (search, 21.08.2019), while a PubMed search\nyields 17189 entries (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?\nterm=organ+preservation). It seems to be a term where the\ndefinition appears so clear and easy that it does not need to\nbe written down. Yet again, a uniform description of organ\npreservation is not straightforward since it is not necessarily\ndefined by organ retrieval, temperature, metabolic state, or any\nother sole condition. The one possible common ground for a\ndefinition is the purpose. Putting an organ into a state that\nallows later reactivation and restitution of its original function\nwith the aim of minimizing damage during the period of mal￾and non-perfusion.\nOne essential limiting factor in the determination of the\nquality of the preservation method is the poor definition of\nendpoint for a clinical readout. Primary non-function (PNF)\nseems relatively well-defined at first glance, but the actual\ndefinitions leave room for interpretation. PNF does not indicate\nno organ function at all but rather a function insufficient to\nprevent/avoid longer-term organ replacement therapy.\nFor example, in liver transplantation, according to Ploeg\net al., PNF is defined by poor initial function, requiring re￾transplantation or leading to death within 7 days after the\nprimary procedure without any identifiable cause of graft failure\n(69). Such parameters inevitably introduce non-specificity into\nthe definition. The call for the need for re-transplantation and\nthe risk for death are clinician’s calls built on medical facts, the\ninterpretation of the physician, and a projection based on the\nparameters and the experience of the doctor. Since alternatives\nare insufficiently well-established, studies relating preservation\nquality to PNF need to be read in the light of this limitation.\nWhile PNF is seen as a suitable measure for organ preservation,\nother factors impacting on the PNF rate need to be considered.\nThe fact that re-transplantation is a risk factor for PNF indicates\nthat the role of recipient factors may be underestimated (70).\nFurther to this, no clinical preservation trial can seriously build\non PNF as an endpoint, since the PNF rates reported more\nrecently are in the range of 2–5%. Primary poor function is even\nmore vague in its sufficiency as a definition and clinical endpoint.\nVery recently, Dutkowski et al. (71) critically reflected on the\ncurrent parameters used to determine the success of preservation\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 6 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nin liver transplantation trials. While the current practice might be\nreasonable in the sense that it is building on the combination of\nparameters currently best established, alternatives are needed but\nneed to be more formally established prior to considering them\nnew clinical standards.\nA Brief History\nThe original vision of organ preservation as formulated in 1813\nwas built on the continuation of circulation and blood supply\n(72). The substitution of blood with perfusion solutions led to\nprolonged successful preservation of tissues, as described by\nCarrell (73). While prolonged successful preservation of tissues\nseems plausible according to these early findings, the actual\nsuitability for transplantation remained to be established (72).\nSuccessful kidney preservation for 3 to 5 days was achieved by\nthe use of continuous perfusion with cooled, oxygenated blood\nor plasma (74). Since continuous warm perfusion, oxygenation,\nand nutrition of an organ during transportation was technically\nvery demanding, the alternative concept eventually surpassed MP\nin the 1960s. The chemical composition of advanced solutions\nfor hypothermic organ storage resulted in excellent short-term\npreservation with good outcomes after transplantation. As with\nany achievement, the good results are a blessing and a curse.\nWith patient and graft survival as the only hard endpoints for\nclinical trials, the room for improvement became very small—\nat least with standard criteria organs. The search for superior\ntechnologies found a platform for clinical realization only when\nthe results after transplantation became less convincing, with a\ngreater effect on bile ducts as a target for early damage in liver\ntransplantation (72, 75–77). The organ shortage, together with\nthe push to use lower-quality organs and organs with additional\ndamage as a result of DCD, triggered the clinical realization of\nMP in liver transplantation.\nCurrent Situation\nThe current status of organ preservation remains largely defined\nby SCS. The well-established and standardized procedures of\norgan storage in three sterile plastic bags filled with preservation\nsolution (bag 1) or saline/ringer lactate/other (bags 2/3) is well￾established, with a relatively good understanding of the risk\naccumulating with the duration of preservation. The major\nadvantage of SCS is the safety of the procedure. Pretty much\nnothing can happen to an organ in plastic bags, on ice, in\na plastic container. The major limitations of this technique\nrelate to the fact that metabolism continues—even though\nat a very low rate—eventually resulting in the accumulation\nof succinate and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (78–81). The\nimmediate exposure to normothermia and oxygen results in an\ninflammatory response and organ-specific damage early after\ntransplantation. The mechanisms responsible for the eventual\norgan damage not only in organ transplantation but also in\nother diseases such as cardiac infarction and stroke are well￾established but not are the focus of this review. The key question\nin the consideration of NMP as an alternative to SCS is how\neffectively the mechanisms leading to an IRI are interrupted\nthrough either immediate NMP or NMP following SCS. While\npreclinical evidence (81) and the phase II/III trial by Nasralla et al.\n(62) have delivered evidence suggesting that NMP is superior to\nSCS when applied immediately, the actual net benefit of NMP\nfollowing SCS remains to be more clearly established. While\na key elements in such assessments are the proper definition\nof and agreement in the community on suitable endpoints\nregarding the preservation quality, the accompanying benefits\nand alternative endpoints should not be overlooked. The major\nbenefit of NMP vs. SCS is the time gained with (as it appears)\na relatively safe prolongation of preservation times under close\nto physiological conditions. The ability to monitor the viability\nand function of the organ adds important parameters for decision\nmaking and significantly ameliorates the logistical challenges\nin transplantation. The benefit of transforming transplantations\ninto scheduled procedures has the potential to significantly\nenhance safety but also training and teaching in transplantation.\nOrgan Reconditioning\nThe term organ reconditioning is used in a rather unspecific\nmanner in our field. According to Wikipedia, reconditioning\nmeans “to restore to a functional state, or to a condition\nresembling the original” (search “reconditioning,” September\n2019). The way this can be read in reference to human organs\nis that no intervention aiming beyond the restoration of the\ncondition of an organ prior to retrieval (a) or beyond the optimal\n(naïve) condition of a healthy human organ (b)—depending\non how the term “original” is interpreted in this context—shall\nbe included. These two possible views already point toward\nvery different states of an organ. The way the term was used\nin the recent scientific transplant literature is in agreement\nwith repair of the immediate injury prior to and during organ\nretrieval and storage. The key element of reconditioning/repair\nas clinically applied at this point relates to the prevention of an\neventual ROS burst by mitochondria and subsequent disruption\nof ATP production, mitochondrial permeability transition pores,\nand danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) release upon\nreperfusion. An electron shift toward succinate and subsequent\nreverse electron transfer upon reperfusion is discussed as a\nmechanism of damage and target of therapy in liver HMP (82).\nNMP is suggested to mitigate post-reperfusion hyperfibrinolysis\n(83) and inflammation (84). While these may be indirect effects\nof NMP, the actual immediate therapeutic mechanisms (if any)\nmay be glycogen repletion and ATP regeneration (85). Whether\nthese mechanisms are a simple effect of the restoration of close\nto physiological conditions or specific for NMP remains to be\nestablished. It is likely, however, that the benefit of NMP is\nmostly defined by the replacement or shortening of SCS and the\nindirect effects on logistics and preparation, organ monitoring,\nand decision making. Further to this, NMP may emerge as a\nplatform enabling organ treatment, while it may not have a\ntherapeutic/reconditioning effect per se.\nOrgan Repair\nHuman organ repair, apparently, is treated as an equivalent\nto organ regeneration (Google search “human organ repair,”\nSeptember 2019). While the common understanding of organ\nrepair might be more mechanistic and that of organ regeneration\nmore biological, the distinction between the terms seems vague.\nAlbeit experimental, therapeutic interventions in lungs seem\nmost closely approaching possible clinical implementation (86).\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 7 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nBronchoalveolar lavage, surfactant replacement, and alveolar\nrecruitment maneuvers seem to positively affect organ tissue\nmorphology and organ function. A hurdle to clinical application\nmay be the legislation. Directive 2004/23/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council “on setting standards of\nquality and safety for the donation, procurement, testing,\nprocessing, preservation, storage, and distribution of human\ntissues and cells” largely focusses on tissues and not organs\nbut represents an important reference. Since preservation times\ncan be prolonged with the technologies being developed and\nurgency may no longer serve as justification for immediate\nprocessing (transplantation) without quality assurance, the legal\nframework for tissues and cells could be applied to organs.\nThe second element of the legal consideration relates to the\nelement of organ therapy. Inevitably, the issues of responsibilities\nand possession require clarification for attempts to introduce\nex vivo human organ treatment into clinical application. As\nlong as an organ is labeled as discarded because it seems\nunsuitable for immediate transplantation, the organ will not\nbe allocated to an individual, and hence considerations of\npossession and responsibilities become less demanding. Once\norgans possibly suitable for immediate transplantation have been\ntreated for reasons such as quality improvement or possibly organ\nreconditioning, the allocation process may be completed and the\nfuture recipient indicated. If and how an individual can consent\nto interventions and/or a trial involving organs will eventually\nrequire clarification.\nDirective 2010/45/EU of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council of 7 July 2010 on standards of quality and safety\nof human organs intended for transplantation (https://eur-lex.\neuropa.eu/eli/dir/2010/53/oj) does not provide much guidance\nregarding this issue.\nMACHINE PERFUSION IN CLINICAL\nPRACTICE\nSCS is a simple, safe, and cheap method to preserve and transport\norgans, and it has been successfully applied over decades with\ngood outcomes in SCD organs. However, to date, the large\ndiscrepancy between patients on the waiting lists and available\ndonor organs has forced the transplant community to cope with\nthe demand by pushing the limits and expanding the donor\npool by accepting increasing numbers of marginal organs from\nECD and reestablish DCD programs (87). Importantly, ECD and\nDCD organs have been identified to be particularly prone to IRI.\nAlthough SCS can decelerate degradation of a preserved organ,\nespecially in high risk or marginal organs, limited applicability\nis the consequence (36, 78). Attempting to overcome this issue,\nseveral MP technologies have been developed and now find their\nway into clinical practice in SOT.\nHMP of the Liver\nLiver HMP has been translated from the experimental state to\nclinical reality over the last decade. In 2010, the first phase I\nprospective cohort study was published, reporting on 20 patients\nwho underwent liver transplantation of grafts preserved by non￾oxygenated HMP. Outcomes were compared to a matched SCS\ncontrol group. HMP time ranged from 2 to 7 h, with a total\nCIT below 12 h. Except for a significantly lower peak serum\nAST in the HMP group, no further significant differences were\nobserved in regard to PNF, early allograft dysfunction, or graft\nand patient survival. However, clinical feasibility, as well as non￾inferiority to SCS, was proven, making way for further studies\n(88). Five years thereafter, the same group showed promising\nresults by transplanting 31 ECD livers declined by the United\nNetwork for Organ Sharing (UNOS) region and preserved under\nhypothermic dynamic conditions at 4–8◦C. Compared to well￾matched SCS controls, significantly fewer biliary complications\nand shorter hospital stays were observed. This study represents a\nlandmark, since the effectiveness of MP was shown within the\nmost susceptible livers in the donor pool (89). The impact of\nHMP on marginal organs was further investigated by Dutkowski\net al. In an international matched-case analysis, 25 DCD livers\nwere subjected to HOPE and compared to matched SCS DCD\nlivers. HOPE resulted in a significant reduction of ischemic\ncholangiopathy (HOPE: 20% vs. SCS: 46%) as well as a significant\nimprovement of 1-year graft survival rates (90 vs. 69%) (58).\nThe beneficial effect of HMP on DCD grafts was confirmed by a\nprospective case-control liver transplantation study, comparing\n10 grafts with at least 2 h of DHOPE to 20 grafts without.\nAn 11-fold increase in cellular ATP during oxygenation was\ndocumented. In addition to good early graft function, both 6-\nmonth and 1-year graft survival were 100%, while 6-month graft\nsurvival and 1-year graft and patient survival in the control group\nwere 80, 67, and 85%, respectively (57). Moreover, the same\ngroup could demonstrate an attenuation of IRI-associated bile\nduct damage after transplantation of DCD end-ischemic DHOPE\nliver grafts (90).\nHOPE in particular has evolved to become a widely used\ntechnology, showing excellent longer-term results. Schlegel et al.\nprovided data on 5-year outcomes of patients receiving DCD\nlivers preserved with 1–2 h of end-ischemic HOPE (n = 50)\nand compared them to the equal numbers of DCD liver\ntransplants without HOPE or DBD liver transplantations. Five￾year outcomes of HOPE-treated DCD liver transplants were\nsimilar to those of DBD primary transplants and superior to those\nof untreated DCD liver transplants (HOPE DCD 94% vs. SCS\nDCD 78%) (91).\nNMP of the Liver\nPreserving an organ under physiological conditions is the ideal\ncondition to prevent deleterious effects of ischemia as well as\nIRI following SOT. Similar to HMP, NMP has recently been\nimplemented in clinical routine at a variety of centers. The\ntransfer from the experimental stage to clinical application\nwas first described by Ravikumar et al. in 2016. In this phase\n1 (first-in-man), non-randomized prospective trial, short-term\noutcomes of 20 recipients of NMP-perfused donor livers were\nmatched in a ratio of 1:2 to cold-stored livers. In the study group,\nlivers were preserved under normothermic conditions over the\nentire preservation period (ranging from 3.5 to 18.5 h). Except for\na significantly reduced peak serum AST in NMP-liver recipients,\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 8 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nno differences regarding short-term recipient survival, PNF rate,\nor early allograft dysfunction were observed. Therefore, the safety\nand feasibility of this dynamic preservation method could be\nconfirmed, opening the field for further clinical investigations\nwith major implications on logistics (66).\nFeasibility and reproducibility following transplantation were\nfurther underlined in a U.S. phase I non-randomized pilot study\n(92). However, this trial also pointed out that NMP of an organ\nis not a trivial procedure and runs the risk of graft loss if\nhuman/technical errors occur. Out of 10 procured livers, one\norgan had to be promptly discarded due to an unrecognized\nportal vein twist. The remaining nine organs (four DCD\nMaastricht class III, 5 DBD) were successfully transplanted, and\noutcomes were comparable to matched control liver transplant\nrecipients of SCS grafts. The proof of concept and feasibility gave\nway for larger-scale trials.\nNasralla et al. were first to perform RCT to test the efficacy\nof NMP vs. SCS. After informed consent had been obtained\nfrom the recipient, the allocated liver was either randomized to\nSCS or NMP. NMP was performed over the entire preservation\nperiod. Outcomes of 121 NMP-graft recipients were compared to\noutcomes from 101 well-matched SCS-graft recipients. The key\nfindings of this study were a significantly reduced peak serum\nAST, a significant reduction of post-reperfusion syndrome, and\na 72% lower adjusted odds rate of developing early allograft\ndysfunction (EAD) in the NMP liver recipients compared to\ncontrols. Furthermore, NMP of the liver graft resulted in\nincreased organ utilization with a 50% lower discard rate in this\ngroup (62).\nThe additional positive effect of NMP is the “almost”\nphysiological aspect of this method, which opens up new\npossibilities by means of organ assessment and organ selection.\nThis fact was a matter of investigation in an observational\nstudy, where livers considered unsuitable for transplantation\nas well as highest risk liver were included. In total, 47 livers\nwere biochemically assessed during the preservation, resulting\nin 39 liver transplants. Remarkably, two out of 19 livers deemed\nunsuitable were transplanted (93).\nIn summary, both HMP/HOPE and NMP are accepted\nand clinically established preservation methods, particularly\ninteresting in the preservation and preconditioning of high-risk\norgans. Especially in this organ category, including ECD and\nDCD livers, they have both been shown to be superior to SCS.\nWhether HMP/HOPE or HMP is superior to the other is still a\nmatter of debate since the two methods have not been correlated\nwith each other in clinical settings, and further RCTs are needed.\nHMP of the Kidney\nThe amount of clinical evidence for dynamic preservation of\nkidney grafts is rapidly increasing. Moers et al. were first to\nperform an international RCT on hypothermically perfused\nkidneys for transplantation. One kidney from 336 deceased\ndonors was randomly assigned to HMP, and the other to SCS. A\nreduced risk of DGF and improved graft survival in favor of MP￾preserved organs was shown (47). These promising results were\nconfirmed in a subsequent RCT from the Eurotransplant region.\nJochmans et al. investigated the efficacy of HMP in preserving\nDCD kidneys. Similar to Moers et al., DCD kidneys were assigned\nin a 1:1 match to HMP or SCS, resulting in a total of 164 kidney\ntransplants (82 HMP vs. 82 SCS). HMP resulted in a significantly\nreduced DGF rate as well as better early graft function after\n1 month compared to SCS. However, 1-year graft survival was\ncomparable in both groups (49).\nFurthermore, in another RCT, kidneys were either preserved\nby HMP or SCS. In accordance with Moers as well as\nJochmans, the primary end-point was the occurrence of DGF.\nSecondary endpoints were primary non-function as well as graft\nsurvival. Both the risk of DGF and the incidence of non￾function were significantly reduced by HMP in their cohort.\nOne-year graft survival and function could be improved by\ndynamic cold graft preservation (52). Despite these findings,\nthe importance of different factors such as the impact of CIT\nand the combination of CIT with HMP have to be mentioned.\nCIT is a known independent risk factor for DGF. In order\nto investigate which kidney graft may further benefit from\nHMP prior to transplantation, Kox et al. analyzed prospectively\ncollected data from the “Machine Perfusion Trial.” A total of 752\nrenal transplants were included with 376 dynamically preserved\nkidneys and 376 statically preserved grafts. They identified CIT\nas an independent risk factor for DGF. Furthermore, HMP did\nnot prevent DGF if CIT exceeded 10 h (51).\nThe optimal timepoint for, as well as the optimal duration of,\nHMP is still a matter of debate. HMP can be used either as a\nprimary preservation method or in the end-ischemic phase as\na reconditioning tool. Matos et al. were able to show a faster\nrecovery of renal function if grafts were subjected to HMP prior\nto transplantation after a mean SCS period of 22 h. MP time was\nat least 6 h. However, this beneficial effect was limited to donors\nunder the age of 50, who represent a rather selective group (94).\nFurther studies followed, indicating a beneficial effect of MP in\nthe end-ischemic phase by displaying a reduction of DGF, as\nwell as an improved organ acceptance. This last positive trend is\nattributed mainly to the possibility of organ monitoring (95, 96).\nNMP of the Kidney\nNMP of the kidney may eventually resolve many issues\nrelated to damage induced by ischemic phases. The idea of\npreserving kidney grafts under almost physiological conditions\nwith the possibility of real-life assessment of the graft prior to\ntransplantation sounds intriguing. However, while the number\nof preclinical studies using animal models as well as discarded\nhuman kidneys is steadily increasing, evidence for NMP of\nthe kidney in a clinical setting is rather poor. Hosgood et al.\nwere first to transform preclinical experience into clinical reality\nby transplanting a 62-year-old ECD kidney into a 55-year old\nrecipient. After 11 h of SCS, the graft was perfused with a\nplasma-free red cell-based solution at 33.9◦C for 35 min prior\nto transplantation. Although a slow graft function was observed,\nthe patient remained dialysis free with a serum creatinine level\nof 132 µmol/L at 3 months post-transplantation. In contrast, the\nrecipient of the opposite kidney developed DGF (64). Based on\nthis first success, the Leicester group translated NMP into clinical\nreality on a larger scale. Eighteen ECD kidneys were subjected to\nNMP reconditioning prior to transplantation. The average NMP\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 9 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\ntime was prolonged to 63 min. Outcomes were compared to 47\nmatched ECD kidneys preserved by SCS. In this study, NMP\nresulted in a significantly reduced DGF rate compared to controls\n(NMP: 5.6% vs. SCS: 36.2%). However, no differences could be\nobserved in regard to 1-year graft or patient survival (97).\nTaken together, HMP of the kidney has been shown to have its\nplace, especially in the preservation of marginal grafts, including\ngrafts from DCD and ECD, with superior outcomes in the early\nphase compared to SCS. However, CIT is still the limiting factor\ninfluencing short- as well as long-term outcomes. In contrast,\nalthough the amount of preclinical data is rapidly increasing,\nNMP is still in its early phase. However, feasibility and non￾inferiority to SCS have been described at this early stage, and\nmulticenter RCTs are planned.\nMachine Preservation of the Pancreas\nIn contrast to the dynamic preservation of liver and kidney,\npancreatic MP is challenging. This is attributed to the physiologic\nas well as the anatomical characteristics of the pancreatic graft\n(98). MP of pancreatic grafts poses major challenges due to the\nsusceptibility of the organ to IRI-associated alterations, including\nacinar necrosis, edema formation, and endothelial disruption.\nThese factors in particular are recognized risk factors for early\ngraft pancreatitis and thrombosis, eventually resulting in graft\nloss (98, 99).\nIn contrast to the liver as well as the kidney, the\npancreas is characterized by a low-flow and low-pressure\nenvironment, which impedes the direct translation of the existing\nperfusion machines for use in dynamic pancreas preservation\n(100). However, the feasibility of pancreatic HMP has been\ndemonstrated in several experimental settings involving the\npreservation of porcine, dog, and discarded human pancreas\ngrafts (55, 101, 102). Although results are promising in this\nexperimental setting, clinical translation is still pending.\nTherefore, assessment and evaluation of a pancreatic graft\nprior to transplantation would be of the utmost importance,\nsince changes in donor demographics result in an increased\nneed for the acceptance of higher-risk grafts at high-volume\ncenters. However, MP of pancreatic grafts must still be considered\nexperimental at this stage.\nMachine Preservation of the Lung\nDue to pre- and peri-retrieval management and direct\nexamination of the donor organ by the explant surgeon, some\nextended criteria organs can be directly used with acceptable risk\nfor the recipient, but a notable number are rejected during the\nretrieval process. There is still a lack of clear decision criteria\nfor lung suitability for transplantation or attempts at lung\nreconditioning using an ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) (103).\nNeedless to say, MP could improve organ availability, which is\ncritically needed in the face of a waitlist mortality that is reported\nto be up to 30% depending on the allocation system (104).\nImportantly, ex vivo prolonged lung preservation resulted in\nsuccessful transplantation of high-risk donor lungs (105), and\nMP is now indispensable for evaluating lung graft quality from\nan uncontrolled DCD (106). Very promising data have come\nfrom experimental EVLP studies, which are outlined later in\nthis article.\nMachine Preservation of the Heart\nAt present, SCS of donor hearts remains the standard practice\nin most transplant units, whereas MP is limited to a few centers\nin the US and Europe. To date, only one device is available for\nclinical use—the Transmedic Organ Care System (OCS) Heart.\nAt mild hypothermia (34◦C), the system uses a combination of\ndonor blood and a proprietary solution as perfusate for the heart.\nIn 2014, heart NMP has led to the first distant procurement DCD\nheart transplantation. To date, over 100 DCD heart transplants\nhave been performed using a cardiac perfusion system (107), and\nMP of hearts exhibited safe preservation in RCTs (108).\nEX VIVO MONITORING OF ORGAN\nFUNCTION AND QUALITY\nCurrently, the decision as to whether organs are suitable for\ntransplantation is determined on the basis of more or less\nsubjective empirically established clinical parameters that have\nbeen shown to be associated with an increased rate of early\nallograft dysfunction or graft failure. Parameters such as donor\npast medical history, last known laboratory values, findings\nduring procurement, and other procurement variables such as\nexpected ischemia times primarily determine the acceptability\nof a graft. These parameters include prolonged warm ischemia\ntime (WIT) >30 min during DCD, prolonged CIT, and\nparenchymal alterations within the graft (e.g., steatosis, fibrosis,\narteriosclerosis). Viability testing and functional assessment\nprior to transplantation are likely to extend the utilization of\nsuboptimal or marginal organs (109–111).\nHMP is an alternative method to standard SCS for the\npreservation of organs. For different types of kidney grafts, HMP\noffers superior preservation compared with SCS. In terms of graft\nquality assessment during HMP, some biochemical parameters of\nthe released perfusate and hydrodynamic parameters are found\nto independently correlate with the outcome—a finding that may\nhelp clinicians in their decision making.\nIncreased Glutathione S-Tranferase (GST), N-acetyl-beta-D￾glucosaminidase (NAG), heart-type fatty acid-binding protein\n(H-FABP), or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations\nduring MP may serve as indicators for suboptimal graft quality.\nFurthermore, levels of redox-active iron measured in the\nperfusate have been correlated with DGF rates (112–114).\nMoreover, the measurement of vascular resistance during MP\nrepresents an additional and objective source of information\nthat can assist clinicians in their decision-making process.\nHigh vascular resistance as a hydrodynamic parameter has\nbeen shown to be associated with an increased risk of DGF\ndevelopment and predictive for 1-year graft failure (115–117).\nTaken together, to date, increased vascular resistance and high\ninjury marker concentrations in the perfusate are risk factors for\nDGF and helpful parameters, but they are not accurate enough\nto justify a decision for discard based on their interpretation\nalone (112–114, 117).\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 10 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nConcerning kidney NMP, a scoring system has been\ndeveloped by Hosgood and Nicholson. The decision on whether\nto transplant an NMP-kidney was based on macroscopic\nappearance, renal blood flow, and total urine output during\nNMP. The authors conclude that, currently, a high percentage of\nretrieved kidneys are being unnecessarily discarded (80, 118).\nCompared to the kidney, data on liver monitoring during\nHMP remain scarce, although recent publications suggest\npromising parameters. A correlation between the AST levels\nin the perfusate during HMP and the peak of AST after liver\ntransplantation has been described. Furthermore, during HMP\nof porcine livers, a cumulative release of Fatty Acid- Binding\nProtein 1 (FABP) or AST may be represented by a linear or\nlogarithmic equation, respectively. Each equation is characterized\nby a b-coefficient that is able to discriminate between livers likely\nto fail. Similarly, during HMP of human livers discarded for\ntransplantation, AST release in the perfusate could discriminate\nbetween livers suitable for transplantation and unsuitable ones.\nMore sophisticated methods to determine graft viability include\nevaluation of ATP content assessed by magnetic resonance\nimaging and spectroscopy (89, 91, 119–121). In this regard, van\nRijn et al. used cellular ATP content during oxygenated dual\n(arterial and portal perfusion) HMP as a viability marker for liver\ngrafts. Cellular ATP content correlated with biochemical function\nearly after transplantation (57).\nFurthermore, there is evidence that a decline in arterial flow\nin a pressure-controlled system of MP can be used as a marker\nfor decreasing graft viability. However, in general, it cannot be\nadvised to use flow values as an indicator of liver damage and\nviability during human liver MP (61, 91, 122).\nConcerning NMP of liver grafts, this technology has been\napplied with promising results for utilization and outcomes\n(62, 66, 92, 123–126), and the option for the assessment of\nliver viability during NMP has been highlighted. Imber et al.\n(127) suggested that bile production is directly associated with\nliver viability. Matton et al. (128) were able to show that a\nbiliary bicarbonate concentration greater than 18 mmol/L has a\nhigh negative predictive value in terms of histological bile duct\ninjury. Moreover, biliary pH greater than 7.48, biliary glucose\nconcentration less than 16 mmol/L, bile/perfusate glucose\nconcentration ratio less than 0.67, and biliary LDH concentration\nless than 3,689 U/L may serve as indicators for high biliary\nviability. Watson et al. (93) published their experience of\ntransplanting declined livers following NMP and graft viability\nassessment. They observed that NMP resulted in a reduced\nincidence of post-reperfusion syndrome and described biliary\npH as a predictive marker for post-transplant cholangiopathy.\nPerfusate lactate and transaminases and bile production during\nNMP were suggested by Op den Dries et al. (129) to serve\nas viability markers. Recently, Mergental et al. (130) published\nviability criteria (applicable within 3 h of perfusion) for livers\nconsidered suitable for transplantation. These include lactate\nclearance, bile production, PH- homeostasis, and stable pressure\nand flow dynamics of the graft.\nThere is growing evidence that hepatic ATP content may serve\nas a viability marker. In clinical studies, hepatic ATP levels prior\nto organ retrieval or during preservation correlated with primary\nliver function after transplantation. Bruisma et al. showed\nthat differences in mitochondrial respiration and restoration of\ncellular ATP contents are possible viability markers in the setting\nof NMP. Moreover, NMP offers the option to perform dynamic\nmetabolomic analyses in both bile samples and sequential liver\nbiopsies (111, 131).\nHowever, although these results seem impressive, none of the\nabove-mentioned viability markers have been validated in larger\nstudies, and the small numbers of patients included in the studies\nmake it difficult to draw robust conclusions.\nRegarding a potential viability assessment of human pancreas\ngrafts during HMP, flow indices and histological assessment\nof duodenal and pancreas-parenchyma biopsies throughout the\nperfusion duration have been proposed. Branchereau et al.\ndescribed an absence of edema, a decrease in resistance indices,\nand normal staining for insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin as\nmarkers for good graft quality (56, 101). Barlow et al. suggested\nthe assessment of amylase levels in the perfusate, fat infiltration\n(detected using standard histology), and exocrine pancreas\nfunction as criteria to assess graft viability during NMP (55).\nConcerning heart transplantation, organ assessment during\nNMP mainly relies on metabolic parameters and measurements\nof lactate levels in the aortic root and pulmonary artery. In the\nPROCEED II trial, three hearts were discarded due to rising total\nperfusate lactate concentrations. Histopathological examination\nshowed myocardial injury (necrosis, hemorrhage, scarring) or\nleft ventricular hypertrophy in those organs (108). Calculations\nof pressure volume loops in the left and right ventricle\nhave been described by switching the heart into a “working\nmode” during NMP. Based on pressure-volume (PV) loop data,\nend-systolic elastance could be calculated as a parameter for\nventricular contractility (44, 132). Due to complicated clinical\ninterpretation and difficulties in reproducibility, “working mode”\nhas been removed from the OCS perfusion module. Contrast\nechocardiography or intravascular ultrasound of coronary\narteries might emerge as tools for anatomical and mechanical\nassessment during NMP but have not been implemented in\nclinical routine so far.\nIn EVLP, assessment of the organ relies primarily on\nfunctional and macroscopic parameters, as has been reviewed\nrecently (103). Adequate gas exchange, stable hemodynamic\nand ventilatory parameters, macroscopic evaluation (absence\nof oedema), bronchoscopy (absence of purulent secretion and\nerythema of the bronchus), and deflation after endotracheal\ntube disconnection (collapse test) during the evaluation period\nare the commonly used decision criteria for acceptance of the\nlung. Yet these criteria are not standardized and differ between\ntransplant centers (103). As physiological parameters are in\nthe lead for decision making in EVLP, clinical single-center\nstudies assessed different biomarkers and metabolic parameters\nof the perfusate or the bronchioalveolar lavage to predict organ\nacceptance and occurrence of early prostaglandin D3 (PGD3).\nMachuca et al. (133) showed that high levels of endothelin-1 (ET￾1) and Big ET-1 measured in perfusate samples have prognostic\nvalue for decline in the lung because of subsequent development\nof poor physiological performance. Subsequently, the same group\nsuggested IL-8 as a powerful predictor for early graft dysfunction\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 11 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\n(134). Furthermore, IL-1β and IL-8 levels measured in the\nperfusate during EVLP were reported to inversely correlate with\nthe recipient oxygenation 24 h post-transplantation (135).\nInterestingly, given the observation that perfusate IL-1β and\nTNF-α at 30 min during EVLP were effective markers for\ndifferentiating between in-hospital survival and non-survival\npost-transplant, blocking the IL-1β pathway during EVLP\nmight reduce endothelial activation and subsequent neutrophil\nadhesion on reperfusion (136).\nIMMUNOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF\n(MARGINAL) ORGANS DURING MACHINE\nPERFUSION\nThe definition of marginal organs per se is a rather arbitrary one.\nThe most commonly used is the dichotomy between standard\ncriteria (SCD) and extended criteria donors (ECD), which is\nsimply discriminated by age and three donor criteria for the DBD\n(and, increasingly, DCD) kidney cohort (13, 137, 138). However,\nin clinical routine, it is not always straightforward to decide if an\norgan is within “standard criteria,” as there are plethora of factors\ninterfering with organ quality, i.e., estimated duration of CIT,\n(functional) WIT, or the grade of steatosis in liver and pancreas,\njust to mention a few.\nWhen we focus on the donor age only, a vast amount of\nliterature exists. There is evidence that the immunogenicity\nof elderly organs is increased, as it is believed that aging in\ncombination with injuries (i.e., brain death) induces a pro￾inflammatory environment, which could lead to an activation\nof innate and adaptive immune responses (139–141). Aging\ninfluences cellular repair mechanisms, and it is known that\nthe number of MHC molecules present on the cellular\nsurface is increased by aged parenchymal cells (139). In\nexperimental studies, transplantation of elderly organs was\nassociated with a more powerful early immune response\ncompared to transplantation of younger ones. Recipients of\nsuch old grafts presented with a higher concentration of\neffector/memory T-cells with an increased alloreactivity, leading\nto acute rejection, which results in a particular high burden\nof damage for the older donor organ (140). Elderly organs do\nnot have the same repair mechanism capabilities, so the clinical\ndamage of acute rejection leaves a more severe defect, explaining\nthe increased rates of DGF and/or graft loss in this donor\ncohort (140, 142).\nAn alteration of immunogenicity in aging organs could be\none reason to focus on preservation techniques (143) such\nas HMP and NMP to learn more about the process or even\nto (re-)condition an organ for reperfusion in the recipient.\nDue to the fact that the reconstitution of a near-physiological\nenvironment might work best to study immune cells, the\nfollowing paragraphs will bring NMP into focus.\nHuman organs are equipped with a sophisticated resident\nimmune system. The kidney, for example, not only hosts tissue￾resident macrophages (144); the organ also harbors lymphocytes,\ninnate lymphoid cells, natural killer (NK) cells, natural killer T\n(NKT) cells, and γδ T cells (145). The residential immune cells\nof human organs remain in a balanced homeostatic state unless\nthey are stimulated—by the insult of brain death in an organ\ndonor, for example—when an immunological activation might be\ninduced. Such a response to a significant injury like brain death in\nan organ donor includes both local and systemic inflammation,\ncomprising cellular infiltrates and a cytokine storm (146).\nWith the current gold-standard preservation technologies such\nas SCS, the organs will be transplanted unchanged, in an\nimmunologically activated status, into recipients in whom\nalloantigens will trigger another immune response immediately\nafter reperfusion, presented by donor-derived antigen presenting\ncells to recipient T cells (147, 148). How important donor￾derived leukocytes are in the allorecognition and rejection\nprocesses was demonstrated by Lechler and Batchelor years\nago. They impressively showed that placing a rat kidney into\nan intermediate recipient before implanting it into the final\nrecipient could significantly prolong allograft survival. These\nexperiments demonstrated that “clearing” the organ of dendritic\ncells (DC), the “passenger leukocytes” responsible for activating\nrecipient T cells, by using the intermediate rat led to the desired\nsuccess (149, 150). “Parking” the organ in an interim host\nis not a feasible strategy for implementation in the clinical\nroutine. However, NMP offers the possibility to represent the\nintermediate recipient as a conditioning tool to achieve the same\nend result, as previously published by Lechler et al. (150). An\nex vivo setting might provide not only a more physiological\npreservation method but also the ability to assess the organ\nprior to transplantation and to investigate its immunological\ncharacteristics in isolation (42).\nOne of the leading groups analyzing marginal and SCD\norgans after ex vivo perfusion is the Manchester group around\nFildes and Stone. Already in 2015, they compared the clinical\noutcome of patients transplanted with marginal donor lungs\nafter undergoing EVLP compared to standard transplantation\nof acceptable lungs (151). Despite having transplanted marginal\nlungs, there was no significant difference in the clinical outcome\nup to 12 months after transplantation concerning the overall\nincidence of acute rejection and the number of treated infection\nepisodes (151). This work was followed by a study on passenger\nleukocyte migration from donor lungs into the recipients and\nthe effects of donor leukocyte depletion prior to transplantation\nusing EVLP (152). In this experimental work using a porcine\nmodel, Stone et al. illustrated that donor leukocyte transfer\ninto the recipient was reduced by EVLP and therefore reduces\ndirect allorecognition and T-cell priming (152). The same group\ntransferred their experience to an ex vivo NMP model to analyze\ndonor-derived leukocytes in a porcine renal transplantation\nmodel. Stone et al. were able to demonstrate that an inflammatory\ncytokine storm and the release of mitochondrial and genomic\nDNA were initiated in the NMP circuit prior to transplantation.\nHowever, the renal function was not impacted at all after\ntransplanting those organs. They suggest that NMP could be used\nto immunodeplete and to saturate the capacity of inflammation\nof donor kidneys before transplanting them (152). Amin et al.\n(153) evaluated the impact of a post-SCS-preservation flush on\nthe inflammatory burden of a limb allograft (a porcine model for\nvascularized composite allotransplantation). The venous effluent\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 12 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nafter flushing the limbs following either 2 or 6 h of SCS comprised\na large population of viable leukocytes, significant concentrations\nof pro-inflammatory cytokines and mitochondrial DNA. These\nresults support the hypothesis that flushing or dynamically\npreserving the organs prior to transplantation impacts the\ninflammatory burden otherwise transferred to the recipient upon\nreperfusion unchanged (153).\nLiver NMP has recently been implemented as a standard\nprocedure in the United Kingdom and been shown to improve\norgan utilization and post-transplant outcomes following phase I\nand phase III prospective randomized trials (62, 66). Jassem et al.\n(84) transplanted, compared, and analyzed 12 NMP-preserved\nlivers against 27 SCS-preserved livers to assess the impact of NMP\non IRI, necrosis, platelet deposition, neutrophil infiltration, and\nthe degree of steatosis after NMP or SCS pre- and post-perfusion.\nTheir results showed that, with NMP, there were altered gene￾expression profiles of liver tissue from pro-inflammation to\nregeneration, reduced numbers of interferon gamma (IFNγ)-\nand interleukin-17-producing T cells, and an enlarged pool\nof regulatory T cells. In addition, NMP liver tissue was less\nnecrotic and apoptotic compared to SCS-preserved livers, with\nless neutrophils infiltrating the periportal area (84).\nOverall, with the clinical and experimental evidence gained\nso far for the field of SOT, dynamic preservation methods -\nand NMP in particular - provide the means to introduce\norgan conditioning so as to lower immunogenicity as well as\npro-inflammatory markers while ensuring the promotion of\ngraft regeneration.\nIMMUNOMODULATION DURING MP\nMachine perfusion (MP) offers a previously non-existent link\nbetween basic and clinical science. The opportunity to treat an\norgan during preservation creates a new field of translational\nresearch. In this context, one of the main targets that can now\nbe addressed is the modulation of the immunogenicity of a\nspecific graft. In theory, such immunomodulation could allow the\nobviation of lifelong immunosuppression or even forge a path to\nthe holy grail in transplantation—the achievement of tolerance.\nImportantly, MP offers a platform to apply immunomodulatory\nstrategies that have been elucidated in in vitro or preclinical\nmodels in the past.\nIn the existing literature, three major such strategies have\nbeen investigated, which are discussed herein. One of the\nmost promising is the application of stem or progenitor\ncells, with the potential to suppress immunogenicity and help\nrepair injured tissue. Another strategy is the administration of\nanti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory drugs and agents, and,\nfinally, gene transduction by adenoviral vector gene delivery.\nThe majority of studies have been carried out under\nnormothermic conditions. However, oxygenated perfusion of\na graft per se seems not only to protect against preservation\ninjury but also to downregulate the immune system and\nblunt the alloimmune response, as was shown in a rodent\nmodel of hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) (154). In\nparticular, the constant flow of fluids in the vessels during MP is\nregarded to promote the expression of vasoprotective endothelial\ngenes, alleviating the microcirculatory failure associated with\nischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) (155–157). On the other\nhand, when it comes to additional modification, it is perfusion\nunder normothermic conditions that seems to represent the\nideal platform, since NMP grants a physiological metabolic\nstate (81, 158–160).\nMany of the ongoing studies addressing the field of\nimmunomodulation during MP are carried out in a porcine\nsetting, as pigs have appropriate size and anatomy as well\nas immunologic characteristics (161). Whereas, much of our\nknowledge on organ preservation is derived from various animal\nstudies (162), the porcine model above all has now evolved\nas an ideal model, making ex vivo porcine organ perfusion\nmodels a suitable platform for translational transplant research.\nAccording to a recent review, in 2017, 22 articles discussed ex\nvivo porcine organ perfusion within the context of transplant\npreservation surgery (162), but the number of articles has steadily\nincreased since then. However, also in this setting, it is important\nto highlight potential limitations when translating experiences\nbetween species (158).\nStem and Progenitor Cells\nSeveral candidate cells have been investigated, including stromal\nmesenchymal cells (MSCs), induced adult pluripotent stem cells,\nfetal stem cells from placenta, membranes, amniotic fluid, and\numbilical cord, and hematopoietic cells (163). Among these,\nMSCs have been reported to represent the most promising cell\nsubset. MSCs are multipotent cells that are found in adult tissues,\nincluding adipose tissue and bone marrow, where they support\nfunction and repair. Importantly, they have been shown to abate\nimmune and inflammatory responses via the release of paracrine\neffectors (164, 165).\nThis circumstance has led to a broad application of MSCs in\na variety of pathologies. Therefore, a prerequisite for research\non MSCs is the agreement on criteria that define these cells and\nallow comparability between studies. The International Society\nfor Cellular Therapy has established the minimum criteria that\na cell must meet to be considered an MSC: first, an MSC\nmust be plastic-adherent when maintained in standard culture\nconditions; second, an MSC must express CD105, CD73, and\nCD90 and lack expression of CD45, CD34, CD14 or CD11b,\nCD79alpha or CD19, and HLA-DR surface molecules; third, an\nMSC must differentiate into cell types of mesodermal origin in\nvitro (166, 167).\nThe fact that MSCs are known for their potent anti￾inflammatory and regenerative capacities, combined with the\nfinding that a therapeutic effect can be achieved with either\nautologous or allogeneic MSCs (168), has led to the conduction of\nseveral studies investigating whether their application is feasible\nin the context of MP. However, the detailed mechanisms by\nwhich MSCs exert their anti-inflammatory and regenerative\npotential have not yet been depicted. The main mechanism of\naction is supposed to rely on secreted mediators. Therefore, an\nappropriate timeframe is likely to be required for these cells\nin order to mediate beneficial effects (169). This hypothesis is\nunderlined by the findings of a recent study in a porcine ex\nvivo lung perfusion (EVLP) model. Twelve-hour NMP of DCD\nlungs with intravascular delivery of MSCs (150 × 106\n) resulted\nin reduced levels of interleukin-8 (IL-8), a pro-inflammatory\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 13 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\ncytokine associated with reperfusion injury, along with increased\nlevels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (170). The\nfact that IL-8 was suppressed is of particular note, since MSCs are\nknown to produce the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which\nin turn has been reported to significantly suppress the production\nof IL-8 in a dose-dependent manner (169).\nIn human kidneys, Brasile et al. demonstrated actual\nrenal regeneration mediated by MSCs under 24 h of ex vivo\nnormothermic perfusion. The authors used an exsanguinous\nmetabolic support (EMS) tissue-engineering platform to study\nfive pairs of kidney allografts from DCD donors. Whereas, one\nkidney of each pair solely underwent perfusion, the partner\nkidney was EMS perfused with MSC (1 × 10). Indeed, a reduced\ninflammatory response was observed along with increased\nsynthesis of adenosine triphosphate and growth factors and a\nnormalization of the cytoskeleton and mitosis (171).\nEven though these findings are promising, more insight\nneeds to be gained regarding the effects of the NMP milieu\non MSC themselves and the comparability between human\nand porcine data. These aspects were highlighted in a kidney\nNMP model, showing that while the suspension conditions\nreduced the viability of porcine MSC by 40% in both perfusion\nfluid and culture medium, the viability of human MSC was\nreduced by suspension conditions by 15% in perfusion fluid,\nand no differences were found in survival in culture medium.\nFurthermore, it was shown that a freeze-thawing process\nimpaired survival, metabolism, and the ability to adhere to\nendothelial cells. The authors concluded that NMP conditions\naffect MSC but show sufficient support of their function and\nsurvival that MSC administration through NMP should be\nconsidered, and secondly that slight differences in the behavior\nof porcine and human MSC need to be taken into account (158).\nAnother recent analysis focused on the characteristics of\nculture-expanded MSC, investigating heir viability and homin\nduring NMP. Kidneys were perfused for 7 h in the presence\nof 105\n, 106\n, or 107 human adipose tissue-derived MSC. Intact\nMSCs were detected in the lumen of glomerular capillaries,\nbut only in the 107 MSC group. After a rapid decline of cell\nnumbers during NMP, only a small portion of the MSCs were\nintact, and these were clustered in a minority of glomeruli. Apart\nfrom outlining the complexity of MSC therapy during MP, the\nauthors concluded that “an exciting new window of opportunity\nmight emerge to actively pre-condition isolated organs in a fully\ncontrolled setting and in the absence of an immune response, before\nthey are transplanted” (172).\nIt is noteworthy that such promising findings have recently\nled to the creation of the international “MePEP consortium”\n(173) in order to study this novel modality of treatment in\npreparation for human trials. Therefore, more findings on MSC\nand immunomodulation can be expected in the near future.\nAnti-inflammatory Agents\nAlternatively, pharmacologic interventions to decrease\nimmunogenicity or prevent recurrent disease can be applied\nduring MP. The seemingly most obvious strategy to influence the\ninflammatory profile is the delivery of anti-inflammatory agents\ndirectly into the machine perfusion circuit, treating the liver\nex vivo during the preservation period to obviate the need for\nlifelong immunosuppression or to improve long-term outcomes\nseparate from the physiological quality of the organ at the time\nof transplantation (174).\nSeveral targets for potential agents have been identified.\nAmongst these is TNF-alpha, one of the most potent\nproinflammatory cytokines, which is released in response\nto and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of IRI (175, 176).\nTherefore, in a recent clinical HMP study, it was hypothesized\nthat the administration of the TNF-α inhibitor etanercept\ncould improve outcomes following kidney transplantation.\nHowever, no significant differences were found concerning\nkidney machine perfusion parameters, including average flow\nand vascular resistance, nor did the authors observe significant\nchanges regarding DGF, rejection episodes, or allograft survival\n(177). However, it has to be taken in mind that this study was\ncarried out under hypothermic conditions. Although possible in\nother machine-perfusion techniques, NMP seems to be ideal, as\nactive metabolism permits graft intervention and modification\nduring preservation, circumstances that are not present in\nHMP (178).\nMore promising data come from a porcine study in\nwhich a variety of agents were added to act at different\nlevels. Prostaglandin E1, a prostacyclin analog with vasodilator,\nantiplatelet, fibrinolytic, and several other anti-inflammatory\nproperties, was continuously administered. In addition, n￾acetylcysteine was added due to its free radical scavenging\nproperties. Sevoflurane was administered due to its protective\nproperties on endothelial cells, and carbon monoxide was\nadded with the objective of improving vasodilatation and\nreducing inflammation. Indeed, during a 3-day follow-up after\ntransplantation, this treatment resulted in lower AST levels as\nwell as lower levels of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF- α),\nand galactosidase and increased IL-10 levels (179).\nOther candidate markers for modulation during MP are anti￾inflammatory receptors. In this context, the adenosine A2A\nreceptor downregulates inflammation, including the suppression\nof CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and increases endothelial cell\nnitric oxide (174). Since experiences in rabbit experiments\nshowed that adenosine A2A receptor activation can diminish\nIRI (180), a subsequent study evaluated whether treatment with\nan adenosine A2A receptor agonist could be beneficial during\nnormothermic ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP). Indeed, EVLP\nwith targeted A2AR agonist treatment could attenuate IRI after\ntransplantation of DCD donor lungs subjected to prolonged 12-h\ncold preservation in a preclinical porcine model (181).\nAdenoviral Vector Gene Delivery\nAs cellular metabolism is preserved during normothermic\nperfusion, it represents a potential platform for effective gene\ntransduction in a specific graft (182). To test this hypothesis\nin donor lungs, Yeung et al. used a porcine model of\nEVLP and treated them with an E1-, E3-deleted adenoviral\nvector encoding either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or the\nimmunosuppressive interleukin-10 (IL-10). They observed a\ndecreased expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1,\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 14 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nTNF-α, and IL-6, as well as attenuation of the alloimmune\nresponse following transplantation (174, 182).\nThis finding is also of particular interest, since the delivery\nof adenoviral vectors could result in a prompt innate immune\nresponse by macrophages, recruiting circulating neutrophils,\nwhich in turn propagate the inflammatory response. Moreover,\nin the transplant setting, this preexisting inflammation could\npotentiate subsequent IRI (182, 183). Therefore, the authors\ncompared in vivo and ex vivo administration and showed that\ndonor lung is superior to in vivo delivery since it leads to less\nvector-associated inflammation (182).\nConcerning the kidney, already in 2002, proof of principle of\na similar technique had been reported by Brasile et al., using a\nrecombinant adenovirus, Ad5, CMV5 GFP encoded with green\nfluorescence protein. They achieved effective transfection and\nsynthesis during 24 h of ex vivo normothermic perfusion (184).\nOnly recently has a normothermic ex vivo organ perfusion\ndelivery method for cardiac transplantation gene therapy been\nreported. Adenoviral vector transduction was utilized to deliver\nparticles of an Adenoviral firefly luciferase vector with a\ncytomegalovirus (CMV) promotor to porcine donor hearts\nduring NMP and prior to heterotopic implantation. Along with\na high copy number of vector genomic DNA in transplanted\nhearts, there was no evidence of vector DNA in either the\nrecipient’s native heart or liver, substantiating the applicability\nand safety of the protocol.\nThese findings make it likely that this technology could be\nfeasible for other organ systems as well. A wide variety of\ninteresting genes could be targeted. As has been reviewed lately\n(159), promising possibilities arise when translating the findings\nof rodent models using adenoviruses expressing CTLA4Ig (185)\nto the setting of NMP; also, NMP could be used to deliver\ngene therapies that induce cytoprotection against IRI, such as\nmyr-Akt (159, 186).\nOutstandingly, Figueiredo et al. recently showed that antigen\nsilencing is feasible during NMP. In a porcine model of\nlung NMP, short hairpin RNAs were delivered by lentiviral\nvectors, successfully reducing the immunogenicity of the\nlung by silencing MHC expression on the endothelium.\nThe authors concluded that the decrease in immunogenicity\ncarries the potential to generate immunologically invisible\norgans to counteract the burden of rejection and\nimmunosuppression (187).\nOrgan Reconditioning and Repair\nRecent experimental data primarily focusing on marginal livers\nfurthermore suggested that NMP offers a platform for organ\nreconditioning and repair.\nImpressive data from Birmingham, UK, showed that livers\ndiscarded due to pronounced steatosis could be effectively treated\nwith defatting agents during 6 h of NMP. Tissue triglycerides\nwere lowered by 38% and macrovesicular steatosis by 40%, which\nwas associated with a down-regulation of inflammatory marker\nexpression relevant for oxidative injury and activation of immune\ncells (CD14; CD11b), combined with reduced inflammatory\ncytokines in the perfusate (TNFα, IL-1β) (188). In addition,\narterial vasospasm can be modulated by the application of ET-1\nantagonists, prostacyclin analog, or calcium channel antagonists\nduring NMP (189). Furthermore, NMP can be used for the\ndirect and efficient application of antiviral agents, as shown in\na porcine NMP model, in which Miravirsen, an inhibitor of\nhepatitis C virus (HCV) replication, produced improved uptake\ncompared to SCS control livers. The authors concluded that\nthis approach might offer a future strategy to prevent HCV\nreinfection after liver transplantation (190). Likewise, HCV￾infected human donor lungs could effectively be treated during\nshort-time EVLP via physical viral clearance combined with\ngermicidal light-based therapies (191).\nIn summary, immunomodulation in the context of MP seems\nto offer a plethora of novel strategies. A series of porcine\nand human studies distinctively underline its effectiveness and\nfeasibility. However, as formulated in a recent review (191, 192),\nthe studies conducted so far just scratch the surface of conceivable\ninterventions. In particular, NMP provides an ideal platform\nfor immunomodulatory modifications. The next step will be the\ntranslation of findings from preclinical and rodent models as well\nas HMP trials into the setting of NMP.\nTHE IMMEDIATE FUTURE IN THE\nTRANSPLANTATION OF MARGINAL\nORGANS\nMuch speculation about the changes in transplantation is\ncurrently energizing the field. The conceptual approach of\nextracorporal organ preservation and monitoring begs for\nspeculation about organ reconditioning, repair, and treatment.\nWhile these are all valid considerations and perfectly reasonable\nhopes, the implementation of machine perfusion is the first\nstep. Immediate and widespread adoption of HMP and NMP is\nunlikely since this technology does not immediately improve the\noutcome with regard to the primary endpoints in transplantation:\npatient and graft survival. Authority approval and market entry\nare largely based on secondary endpoints such as delayed\ngraft function (DGF, kidney) or primary poor function (PPF,\nliver), which are considered to serve as surrogates for improved\nlong-term results. The conceptual limitation with surrogates is,\nhowever, that the predictive value is not uniformly robust or\nformally established and immediately reproducible. The DGF\nrate, for example, in kidneys from DCD donors is high, but\nthe predictive value of DFG in these cases is low (193). The\ndefinition of PPF is mostly based on high AST/ALT values early\nafter transplantation. While these parameters indicate hepatocyte\ndamage, correlation with the eventual outcome is very limited\n(194). Hence, the adoption of the technology is possibly built\non the wish for innovation and the belief in the value of the\ntime gain with NMP. Preliminary data on HOPE in recent and\nongoing trials indicate a possible benefit in organ survival. If such\nan outcome is eventually formally achieved, the arguments for\nimplementation will be more substantial.\nFor clinical implementation, several regional and center\nfactors play an important role. First, the retrieval team\nmay be different from the team eventually performing the\ntransplantation. Even if the retrieval team is familiar with the\ntechnology, the preparation of the graft prior to NMP (more\nthan HMP) is more substantial and more definitive for the\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 15 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nfate of the graft. Hence, in a system with longer-distance organ\nexchange, additional steps and a new routine would need to be\nestablished. The technology and the shifting of the work of the\nbacktable procedure to the retrieving team need to be considered.\nThe alternative approach where the organ is transferred to\nthe recipient center and is then machine perfused is currently\nbeing pursued, but data indicating the actual advantage of this\napproach are lacking (195). For now, NMP serves as a technology\nthat allows one important asset in surgery to be gained: time.\nThe value of time and flexibility is dependent on the regional\ncircumstances but may hold great potential for easing the surgery\nlogistics, working hours, and surgical training but also gives rise\nto higher risks of nighttime procedures. The actual value of time\nin this context, however, requires further attention and needs to\nbe better defined.\nThe consideration of longer-term organ preservation under\nnormothermic conditions further carries the challenge of\ndefining the responsibilities for managing and monitoring the\norgans. Eventually, the working place description of health\ncare workers involved in this will require adoption and formal\ntraining. Standard operating procedures (SOP) and safety\nparameters need to be established for a wider spread use of\nthe technology. It is likely that the advanced technological\nrequirements and the need for 24-h availability of knowhow and\npersonnel would favor the establishment of regional hubs for MP.\nDespite the hype in the field, the clinical adoption of MP is\nslow. In addition to the above-mentioned factors, the lack of\nreimbursement is a stringent limitation in many regions. For the\ntechnology to be reimbursed, the authorities will require hard\nfacts. Hence, the path to more widespread clinical use might\nbe long, and the focus should remain on the demonstration of\nsuperiority regarding the most relevant clinical endpoints.\nOne major important step toward collective advancement in\nthis field would be the definition of data points during and\nafter MP and the establishment of registries for coordinated\ndata collection. Such data points should include the definition\nand terminology of the various time points and actions such as\ncold flush and storage prior to MP, temperature and flow during\nMP, parameters indicating metabolic function and bile/urine\nproduction during MP, second flush, second cold ischemia time,\nand others. One of the hurdles in improving NMP is the\nlarge number of variables added to preservation. Identifying\nthe relevance of individual parameters will require attention\nto the details of the procedure and adequate data collection\nand handling. To the knowledge of the authors, no routine\ndata collection and no consensus toward data points have been\nestablished at present.\nThe decision-making process in MP is relatively arbitrary\nsince the data collected during MP are suggestive but not formally\nestablished as quality-defining parameters. Since the decision to\ntransplant an organ or not is extremely meaningful, great care\nneeds to be applied in the process, and detailed documentation\nof the reasoning for decision making should be carried out. A\ngreater effort toward orchestrated data collection could help to\nstreamline and eventually enhance the robustness of the decision￾making process.\nThe preference for MP to be used for the preservation\nof marginal organs results from the greater need for\norgan assessment and the greater potential benefit of better\npreservation. This might be particularly true and relevant for\norgans from uncontrolled DCDs, where the circumstances and\nthe accumulated damage to the organs might be less clear. The\nvalue of an additional assessment under these conditions is not\nonly meaningful with respect to the number of additional organs\nfor transplantation but also for preventing the transplantation\nof organs that are severely damaged. While the assessment\nof this subject would be highly valuable and is much needed,\nthe behavior of the investigators in the NMP trial by Nasralla\net al. indicates the limitations and conflicts observed with this\napproach (62). Since the trial cannot be fully blinded, the bias\ngenerated by the fact that a technology is used that is deemed\nsuperior and the data generated during MP define a deviation in\nthe behavior of the decision makers.\nTHE FAR FUTURE OF (MARGINAL) ORGAN\nTRANSPLANTATION\nThe fantasies building on the realization of extracorporal organ\npreservation under physiological conditions are currently\nfuelling hopes that this technology could facilitate tissue\nregeneration, organ repair, immunomodulation, xenograft\nhumanification, and many other things. MP as a platform\nmay impact medicine far beyond transplantation and delivers\na unique chance to alter the treatment of organ failure and\norgan disease. Between the imagination and the realization\nof medical advancement stands a mountain of work and an\nas yet unknown but probably large number of technical and\nmethodological challenges. An important initial goal is the\nexpansion of the duration of MP and the establishment of\nan equilibrium of the condition of the organ. Preservation\nof organs for several days will likely require additional\nmodifications from the currently existing technologies.\nPreservation of the acid-base equilibrium, nutrition organ\nweight-induced pressure, electrolyte shift, hemolysis, and many\nother challenges may require closer attention. A tissue- and/or\ncell-specific and targeted treatment is a realistic consideration,\nand proof of concept trials indicate the feasibility of this\napproach (196, 197). The treatment and replacement of\ndamaged or displaced elements of organs may evolve as a\nnew discipline and help the field to make the leap to serve\none of the greatest unmet needs: The effective treatment of\ndamaged organs.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nTR and SS conceived and designed the study and wrote the\nmanuscript.

The authors discuss the definitions of marginal organs for each organ and highlight the challenges associated with expanding the donor pool due to the increased prevalence of extended criteria donors (ECD) and donation after cardiac death (DCD). The article explores the benefits and limitations of MP, including its ability to restore organ function, reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury, and enable the assessment of organ quality. The authors also touch upon the potential for MP to facilitate organ modification, treatment, and repair. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of developing a comprehensive understanding of the immune system of organs during MP and the need for further research in this area. Overall, the article suggests that MP holds promise as a technique for improving outcomes for marginal organs, but more studies are needed to fully understand its potential benefits and limitations."}

Progressive\ndonor organ shortage and declining donor organ quality justify the evaluation of the leverage of the Donor-Risk-Index,\nwhich was recently adjusted to the Eurotransplant community’s requirements (ET-DRI). We analysed the prognostic\nvalue of the ET-DRI for the prediction of outcome after liver transplantation in our center within the Eurotransplant\ncommunity.\nResults: 291 consecutive adult liver transplants were analysed in a single centre study with ongoing data\ncollection. Determination of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was performed to\ncalculate the sensitivity, specificity, and overall correctness of the Eurotransplant-Donor-Risk-Index (ET-DRI) for the\nprediction of 3-month and 1-year mortality, as well as 3-month and 1-year graft survival. Cut-off values were\ndetermined with the best Youden-index. The ET-DRI is unable to predict 3-month mortality (AUROC: 0.477) and\n3-month graft survival (AUROC: 0.524) with acceptable sensitivity, specificity and overall correctness (54% and 56.3%,\nrespectively). Logistic regression confirmed this finding (p = 0.573 and p = 0.163, respectively). Determined cut-off\nvalues of the ET-DRI for these predictions had no significant influence on long-term patient and graft survival\n(p = 0.230 and p = 0.083, respectively; Kaplan-Meier analysis with Log-Rank test).\nConclusions: The ET-DRI should not be used for donor organ allocation policies without further evaluation, e.g. in\ncombination with relevant recipient variables. Robust and objective prognostic scores for donor organ allocation\npurposes are desperately needed to balance equity and utility in donor organ allocation.\nKeywords: Prognostic model, Accuracy, Goodness-of-fit, Score, Prediction, Validation\nBackground\nExpansion of the organ donor pool by using grafts with\nreduced quality has become reality in transplant centers\naround the world due to increasing donor organ short￾age and raising numbers of patients on the waiting lists.\nThis has led to an increased awareness of the associated\nrisks for patient and graft survival [1-16]. Thus, a series\nof attempts to develop objective scores for the assess￾ment of donor liver quality with significant influence on\npatient and/or graft survival have been made [1,2,4-9].\nIn the transplant literature there is a current debate on\nthe criteria for statistical validation of prognostic scores\nin liver transplantation that may be relevant for fair and\njust allocation rules that balance equity and utility\n[10,12,13,17,18]. Astonishingly, there is still a high het￾erogeneity of statistical approaches to the validation of\nprognostic scores even though Jacob et al. published as\nearly as 2005 uniform quality criteria for the design, val￾idation and reporting of prognostic scores in liver trans￾plantation more than eight years ago [18]. Last year we\nhave reported from our centre that the Donor-Risk￾Index is not applicable to our patients for the prediction\nof three month mortality, three month patient survival,\nthree month graft survival as well as the necessity of\nacute retransplantation within thirty days [13]. In con￾trast Blok et al. claimed in the same year that they were\nable to validate the value of the DRI for the prediction\nof three month, one year and three years graft survival\nin the Eurotransplant region [3].

This raises the fundamental question: What\nare the criteria for a robustly validated prognostic model?\nA relevant body of scientific literature in the bio￾statistical world agrees on the outstanding value of the\nreceiver operating curve analysis for the determination\nof the value of clinical prognostic scores [18-22]. There￾fore, we present in this paper a validation study on the\nrecently published Eurotransplant-Donor-Risk-Index\n(ET-DRI) and evaluate its value for prognostic decision\nmaking in the cohort of our center.\nThis study is a timely contribution to the urgently\nneeded debate on prognostic models in liver transplant￾ation with potential impact on donor organ allocation\npolicies. The recent liver transplant scandals in Germany\nrevolve around waiting list manipulations that affected\ndonor organ allocation directly and undermined public\ntrust in current donor organ policies [23].\nResults\nET-DRI score\nThe variables’ frequencies, range and percentages used\nin the ET-DRI of our study population are summarized\nin Table 1. The mean ET-DRI in this cohort was 1.79\n(median 1.70, range: 1.14 - 3.79).\nMajor results of the analyses of the ET-DRI’s predict￾ive capabilities for the study endpoints are summarized\nin Table 2.\nPrediction of 3-month mortality\nWith an AUROC of 0.477 (95%-CI: 0.390-0.564) the ET￾DRI failed to predict 3-month mortality after liver trans￾plantation in our study population (see Figure 1). This\nresult could be confirmed by binary logistic regression\n(p = 0.692). The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test\ndid show that the model fit of the logistic regression\nmodel was adequate (p = 0.542). Kaplan-Meier survival\nanalysis above versus below the calculated cut-off level\nof the ET-DRI for the prediction of 3-month mortality\n(2.06) did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.172,\nLog Rank; see Figure 2).\nPrediction of 1-year mortality\nFurther, the ET-DRI did not reach a relevant AUROC\nfor the prediction of 1-year mortality (AUROC 0.492)\n(see Table 2). A well fitted binary logistic regression\nmodel (p = 0.262, Hosmer-Lemeshow test) revealed no\nstatistically significant influence of the ET-DRI values on\n1-year mortality (p = 0.573). The calculated cut-off level\nfor this prediction is identical to the cut off for the pre￾diction of 3-month mortality. Therefore, it is no surprise\nthat the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis above versus\nbelow this cut-off level did also not reach statistical sig￾nificance (p = 0.230, Log Rank; see Figure 2).\nPrediction of 3-month graft survival\nWith an AUROC of 0.524 (95%CI: 0.447-0.601) the ET￾DRI failed to predict 3-month graft survival after liver\ntransplantation in our study population (see Figure 3).\nFurther, investigation of the ET-DRI as a risk factor for\n3-month graft loss with a well fitted binary logistic re￾gression model (p = 0.491, Hosmer-Lemeshow test)\nremained insignificant (p = 0.475). Kaplan-Meier analysis\nof graft survival above versus below the determined cut￾off level for the prediction of 3-month graft survival did\nnot reach statistical significance (p = 0.655, Log Rank;\nsee Figure 4).\nPrediction of 1-year graft survival\nApplied to our data the ET-DRI is not able to predict\n1-year graft survival as shown by ROC-curve analysis re￾sults (AUROC = 0.540; 95%CI: 0.473-0.607). In binary\nlogistic regression, which was performed with adequate\nmodel goodness of fit (p = 0.631, Hosmer-Lemeshow\ntest), the ET-DRI was no statistically significant risk fac￾tor for graft loss within one year after transplantation\n(p = 0.163). Kaplan-Meier analysis of graft survival above\nversus below the determined cut-off level (1.84) did not\nreach statistical significance (p = 0.083, Log Rank).\nTable 1 Shown are the donor characteristics of our study\npopulation’s variables which are part of the ET-DRI model\nVariables\nn (%)\nCOD anoxia 24 (8.2%)\nCOD cerebrovascular accident 181 (62.1%)\nCOD other 86 (29.6%)\nDCD nil\nSplit LTX (yes/no) 20 (6.9%)\nregional share (yes/no) 253 (86.9%)\nnational share (yes/no) 38 (13.1%)\nrescue offer (yes/no) 53 (18.2%)\nage group <40 years 71 (24.4%)\n40 ≤ age < 50 (in years) 69 (23.7%)\n50 ≤ age < 60 (in years) 105 (36.1%)\n60 ≤ age < 70 (in years) 52 (17.9%)\n70 ≤ age (in years) 12 (4.1%)\nmean (median) range\nCIT in h 9.75 (9.6) 2.4 – 27.3\nlatest labGGT (U/L) 70.66 (43.0) 5 – 775\nAge in years 48.4 (51.0) 12 – 74\n(COD = cause of death, DCD = donation after cardiac death, LTX = liver\ntransplantation, CIT = cold ischemic time).\nReichert et al. Journal of Negative Results in BioMedicine 2013, 12:18 Page 2 of 8\nhttp://www.jnrbm.com/content/12/1/18\n\nPower calculation and sample size\nSince the focus of this paper is prognostic estimation ra￾ther than hypothesis testing, strictly speaking power\ncalculations are not directly relevant. The rationale for a\nsufficient sample size in the presented study is the fact\nthat all 95%-CIs of the AUROCs are sufficiently narrow to\nexclude 0.700, the nominal criterion value for utility [20].\nDiscussion\nThe ET-DRI was originally developed with thousands of\npatients transplanted in the Eurotransplant region in￾cluding many transplant centers and the authors claimed\nthat the ET-DRI is of prognostic relevance for graft sur￾vival after liver transplantation [5]. We believe that the\nfundamental discrepancy to our results and interpret￾ation can be related to the fact that the ET-DRI as\nshown by Braat et al. cannot reach a c-index above 0.700\nfor the prediction of graft survival in thousands of liver\ntransplant recipients [5]. This finding could be con￾firmed in our study with AUROCs <0.700.\nBraat et al. [5] used the previously published DRI [7]\nwhich was developed in the United States and they\nattempted to tailor and adapt the DRI to the donor\npopulation in the Eurotransplant region. The goal of our\nstudy was to test the ET-DRI as a prognostic model in\nour centre with current MELD-based liver allocation\nrules. Braat et al. used a dataset of recipients who were\ntransplanted in the vast majority of cases outside\nMELD-based organ allocation between 2003 and 2007.\nMELD-based liver allocation was introduced in Germany\nin December 2006 [5]. Braat et al. claimed in their paper\nwhich was published in 2012 that the ET-DRI should be\nused for liver allocation in the future [5]. We therefore\nbelieve that our analysis of the ET-DRI with a current\ncohort is fully justified in order to assess the potential\nmerit of the ET-DRI for the future. Braat and colleagues\nclearly stated quite righteously that Eurotransplant is di￾vided into different regions; i.e. for Austria, Belgium/\nLuxembourg, Croatia, the Netherlands and Slovenia\neach country is considered as one region, whereas\nGermany is divided into seven regions. Therefore the\nterm allocation is divided into local (transplant center is\nin the procurement area), regional (transplantation and\nprocurement area within the same country, or region in\nGermany), and national or extra-regional (anywhere in\nEurotransplant, but outside the region) [5]. Interestingly,\nthe ET-DRI calculation formula as shown by Braat et al.\ndoes not contain a criterion for local share. Our analysis\nof the influence of local versus regional versus national\nshare on transplant outcome did not show a significant\nimpact of local share on outcomes in our cohort\n(p < 0.05; Chi2\n).\nCurrently, Avolio et al. have claimed that ROC-curve\nanalysis is not the adequate measure to assess the value\nof prognostic models for graft or patient survival, espe￾cially if they include donor organ variables. Additionally,\nthey postulated that it would be preferable to use time￾dependent ROC-curve analysis [17]. This notion is an\nexpansion of the current thinking as expressed in the\nmajority of recent bio-statistical publications [18-21].\nSensitivity, specificity and area under the ROC-curve are\noften used to measure the ability of survival models to\npredict future risk [18-21]. Estimation of these parame￾ters is complicated by the fact that these parameters are\nTable 2 Shown are the results of the analyses of the study endpoints\nEndpoint ET-DRI cut off values\nAUROC 95%-CI Logistic regression p-value Sensitivity Specificity Overall correctness\n3-month mortality 0.477 0.390-0.564 p = 0.692 2.06 26.7% 81.4% 54%\n1-year mortality 0.492 0.405-0.579 p = 0.573 2.06 26.7% 81.4% 54%\n3-month graft survival 0.524 0.477-0.601 p = 0.475 1.95 38% 74.5% 56.3%\n1-year graft survival 0.540 0.473-0.607 p = 0.475 1.84 47.4% 63.6% 55.5%\nAUROC = area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; 95%-CI = 95%-Confidence Interval\nFigure 1 Shown is the ROC-Curve for the prediction of 3-month\nmortality after liver transplantation with the ET-DRI (AUROC =\n0.477; 95%CI: 0.390-0.564).\nReichert et al.

Furthermore, censoring affects their es￾timation just as it affects estimation of survival curves or\ncoefficients of survival regression models [22]. In the\npresented study only relatively short time windows\nhave been investigated. Therefore, application of time￾dependent ROC-curve analysis is in our view not\njustified.\nThere is currently no objective score for the assess￾ment of donor organ quality available that would be able\nto predict short-term patient and graft survival with ac￾ceptable overall correctness ((sensitivity + specificity)/2).\nIt appears safe to assume that extended donor criteria\norgans with extreme properties would affect graft sur￾vival negatively in the short-term and lead to initial graft\nnon-function which is known to be associated with in￾creased patient mortality [1,2,4-9,14,15]. Current prog￾nostic scores for donor organ quality are unable to\ndemonstrate significant statistical influences on short￾term graft survival as robust prognostic tools\n[1,2,4-10,12-15]. We believe that these currently avail￾able scores may have missed potentially critical parame￾ters and/or combinations of donor organ variables and/\nor their interaction that may be critical for a robust\nprognostic score to predict short-term graft survival with\nacceptable overall correctness. The design of many prog￾nostic scores in the medical literature, including the ET￾DRI has failed so far to assess multivariable co-linearity\nof the influences of variables on the target output vari￾able (e.g. graft survival) [5,18,26].\nHanley and McNeil have shown that c is identical to a\nwidely used measure of diagnostic discrimination, the\nAUROC in ROC-curve analysis [20,21]. A value of c of\n0.5 indicates random prediction and a value of 1 indicates\nn=231 (79.4%)\nn=60 (20.6%)\nFigure 2 Kaplan Meier survival analysis above and below the ET-DRI cut-off values for the prediction of 3-month mortality (2.06) shows\nthat this cut-off value has no significant influence on long-term survival (p = 0.172; Log Rank). The curve clearly demonstrates that the\nET-DRI has no influence on long-term survival and limited influence on survival within the first 90 days.\nFigure 3 Shown is the ROC-Curve for the prediction of 3-month\ngraft survival after liver transplantation with the ET-DRI\n(AUROC of 0.524 (95%CI: 0.447-0.601, SD 0.039).\nReichert et al. Journal of Negative Results in BioMedicine 2013, 12:18 Page 4 of 8\nhttp://www.jnrbm.com/content/12/1/18\n\nperfect prediction. A model having c greater than roughly\n0.7 has some utility in predicting the responses of individ￾ual subjects [21]. The c-index 0.624 which was published\nbefore for the prediction of graft survival with the ET-DRI\nin a large Eurotransplant cohort [5] appears therefore as a\nmeasure of limited utility of this score.\nThis study is limited by the relatively small number of\nenrolled patients (n = 291). However, none of the 95%\nCIs included a relevant AUROC >0.700. Moreover, organ\nprocurement from donors after cardiac death is a rele￾vant factor of the original population, in which the ET￾DRI was created [5]. Unfortunately we were not able to\ninclude this specific donor group, because liver donation\nafter cardiac death is not applied in Germany. Thus, the\nresults of this analysis may be confounded by the ab￾sence of these cases.\nTaken together we believe that the ET-DRI or any\nother donor risk score should not be used for donor\norgan allocation rules without adequate criticism of its\nmethodological limitations. The transplant community\ndesperately needs a debate on the power and limitations\nof prognostic scores in liver transplantation which\nshould lead to a consensus. In our opinion Jacob et al.\nhave made a reasonable proposal for the quality assess￾ment of prognostic models for liver transplantation [18].\nThe application of a previously developed score to a\nnew dataset premises that the characteristics of both refer￾ence and study populations should result in overlapping\nor at least should present similar patterns [17]. This ex￾pectation is met with our study population which is a sub￾set of the Eurotransplant population which was used by\nBraat and colleagues [5].\nWe believe that the reasons for our findings which\nsomehow contrast the previously published findings [5]\nare maybe due to a strong center bias. This notion is\nlikely because our population constitutes a subpopula￾tion of the one that was investigated by Braat et al. [5].\nFurther, the fact that at least two transplant centers\nwithin the Eurotransplant region are known to believe\nthat rescue allocated organs do not affect outcome after\nof liver transplantation [27,28] and the fact that the per￾centage of accepted rescue allocated livers for trans￾plantation differs widely within the Eurotransplant\nregion may contribute to this center bias. In our center\nthe percentage of rescue allocated livers was compara￾tively low (18.2%) while approximately 30% of livers in\nthe Eurotransplant region are transplanted after rescue\nallocation [27].\nAnother critical aspect in donor organ assessment is\nthe histological diagnostics. Not all donor livers are bi￾opsied. Moreover, the frequency of biopsies is com￾pletely dependent on the indication to perform a\nhistological examination. This subjective and irregular\nindication is the responsibility of the explant surgeon or\nthe accepting transplant center. Recently, two studies de￾scribed the importance of steatosis as a donor risk factor\nn=191 (65.6%)\nn=100 (34.4%)\nFigure 4 Kaplan Meier survival analysis above and below the ET-DRI cut-off values for the prediction of 3-month graft survival (1.95)\nshows that this cut-off value has no significant influence on long-term graft survival (p = 0.655; Log Rank). The curve clearly\ndemonstrates that the ET-DRI has no influence on long-term graft survival.\nReichert et al. Journal of Negative Results in BioMedicine 2013, 12:18 Page 5 of 8\nhttp://www.jnrbm.com/content/12/1/18\n\n[29,30]. Spitzer et al. [30] concluded that steatosis should\nbe added to the DRI, when dealing with a high-risk\ndonor. However, objective evaluation of the range of\nsteatosis, either as macro- or microvesicular steatosis, is\nnot standardized so far subjective to some degree [29].\nWe believe that routine donor biopsy evaluation may en￾able the design of more powerful and robust donor risk\nscores.\nWe believe that the prognostic power of the DRI and\nET-DRI is further significantly undermined by the fact\nthat graft acceptance decisions on offered organs for\ntransplantation are not documented and evaluated in\nthese scores. There is an urgent need to evaluate and ad￾dress this shortcoming immediately, especially on the\nbackground of the current liver transplant scandals in\nGermany [23,31]. We believe that this aspect is a rele￾vant issue in liver transplantation today. Transplant cen￾ters regard their graft acceptance policy as their\npotential advantage in a highly competitive area for a\nvery scarce resource in times of ubiquitous organ short￾age. It can be assumed that these aspects of potentially\nunwanted transparency by the proponents of transplant￾ation stood in the way of previous attempts to generate\nrobust prognostic scores that include donor organ qual￾ity. This may represent a deeper reason for the notorious\ndifficulty to assess donor organ quality and its impact on\nprognosis after transplantation objectively.\nThe balance of equity and utility in donor organ allo￾cation is a serious ethical dilemma. Several risk predic￾tion models are available and their head to head\ncomparisons would benefit from standardized reporting\nand formal, consistent statistical evaluation [18,26]. It\nwas claimed previously and in a different context that\noutcome selection and optimism biases may affect litera￾ture on prognostic scores in medicine [26].\nWe would like to propose joint efforts to develop a ro￾bust and objective donor risk score in an international\ncollaboration that should include the available large\ndata-sets from multiple institutions. We believe that the\ntime has come for a consensus on the reporting of the\nreasons for declined organ offers and on quality stan￾dards for prognostic scores and their statistical analysis\nand validation. Jacob et al. [18] proposed a reasonable\nscientific approach to the latter. High quality scientific\njournals should make uniform requirements mandatory\nfor the reporting of prognostic scores.\nConclusion\nThe results of this current study clearly show that the\nET-DRI is not applicable in the population from our\ncenter within the Eurotransplant community for the pre￾diction of patient or graft survival. On the background\nof a paucity of proper prognostic models, justified organ\nallocation which weighs urgency against prediction of\nsuccess of liver transplantation must be the aim of future\nresearch in this field.\nPatients and methods\nEthics statement\nAs an observational retrospective study, according to the\nProfessional Code of the German Medical Association\n(article B.III. § 15.1), neither informed consent nor ap￾proval of the ethics committee was needed for this\nstudy.\nPatients\n291 consecutive liver transplants were included to\nanalyze the model’s accuracy and applicability for this\ndataset of a major transplant centre in the Eurotrans￾plant community. Included were 20 (6.9%) split liver\ntransplants, 30 (10.3%) acute re-transplants (retransplan￾tation within 30 days after the previous transplant) and\n25 (8.6%) chronic retransplants (primary transplantation\nn = 235, secondary transplantation n = 48, tertiary trans￾plantation n = 6, quaternary transplantation n = 1) in a\ntotal of 257 patients (median age: 49.6 years, range: 18–\n69 years; males n = 177 (64.4%), females n = 114 (35.6%),\nratio males/females: 1.8). All transplants were performed\nin our centre between the 01/01/2007 and the 12/31/\n2010. The post-transplant observational period ended on\nthe 12/31/2011. Indications leading to liver transplant￾ation as well as the most probable leading causes of\ndeath in our cohort are summarized in Tables 3 and 4.\nStudy end-points\nPrimary study endpoints were 3-month and 1-year pa￾tient mortality and 3-month and 1-year graft survival.\n(Graft survival and failure free survival (FFS) are syno￾nyms that describe the time period from date of trans￾plantation until the date of retransplantation or recipient\ndeath).\nStatistical analysis\nFor the primary study endpoints ROC-curve analysis was\nperformed to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, and\noverall model correctness of the ET-DRI as a predictive\nmodel. AUROCS larger than 0.7 indicate a clinically\nuseful prognostic model [18-22]. The respective cut-off\nvalues of the potential prognostic models were deter￾mined with the best Youden index (Youden index =\nsensitivity + specificity – 1) [24]. If possible, the Hosmer￾Lemeshow Chi2\n-statistic goodness-of-fit test was applied\nto assess model calibration of the binary logistic regres￾sion models. These statistics suggest good fit when the\nassociated p-values are greater than 0.05 [21,25]. Survival\nanalysis was performed with the Kaplan-Meier method.\nThe statistical influence of the determined cut-off values\non patient and graft survival was analyzed with the Log\nReichert et al.

Binary logistic regression was performed as\nadditional test to determine the influence of the ET-DRI\non study end-points. For all statistical tests a p-value\n<0.05 was defined as significant. The SPSS statistics soft￾ware version 20.0 (IBM, Somers, NY, USA) was used to\nperform statistical analysis.\nCalculation of the ET-DRI\nThe ET-DRI was calculated as described before with this\nformula [5]:\nET-DRI = exp[0.960((0.154 if 40 ≤ age < 50) + (0.274If\n50 ≤ age < 60) + (0.424 if 60 ≤ age < 70) + (0.501 if 70 ≤\nage) + (0.079 if COD = anoxia) + (0.145 if COD = cere￾brovascular accident) + (0.184 if COD = other) + (0.411\nif DCD) + (0.422 if partial/split) + (0.105 if regional\nshare) + (0.244 if national share)) + (0.010 × (cold ischemia\ntime − 8 h)) +0.06((latest lab GGT (U/L)- 50)/100) +\n(0.180 if rescue offer)].\nRegional share was defined by Braat et al. as allocation\nwithin Germany and national share as allocation within\nEurotransplant land [5].\nData collection\nThis is a single centre analysis complemented by on￾going data collection.\nSetting\nThe setting of the study is a university hospital in\nGermany within the Eurotransplant community.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nIncluded were all consecutive liver transplants per￾formed in adult recipients (minimum age 18 years).

Liver transplantation\noffers the only curative therapy for patients with end-stage liver\ndisease (ESLD). However, the supply of donor livers remains\ninadequate to meet the demand, necessitating an effective\npolicy for organ allocation. In order to minimize waitlist\nmortality, a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) - based\norgan allocation was proposed. First adopted by the United\nStates in February 2002, it has become one of the most widely\nused approaches to prioritizing liver transplant candidates in\ncountries around the world. The MELD score was initially\ndeveloped by Malinchoc et al [1] to predict mortality in patients\nundergoing transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts, but\nhas since been validated as predictor of short-term mortality in\npatients awaiting transplantation. It uses objective variables\n(creatinine, bilirubin and the international normalized ratio of\nprothrombin time (PTINR)) to quantify the severity of ESLD,\nenabling the prioritization of patients in need of liver\ntransplantation by medical urgency. An ideal system would\nallocate organs to patients not only at the highest risk of dying\nwithout transplantation, but also with the highest likelihood of\nsurvival following transplantation.\nIn recent years, the possibility of using pre-transplant MELD\nto predict post-transplant survival has been explored in many\nopinion pieces and expert reviews[2]. However, it has yet to be\nassessed through a systematic review and critical appraisal of\npublished studies that adheres to internationally accepted\nsystematic review guidelines. The need for such a review is\nheightened by the lack and infeasibility of RCTs on this topic\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 December 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 12 | e80661\n\nand the fact that considerable debate over the value of MELD\nin this context remains. Thus, the aim of this study was to\nassess the association and predictive value of pre￾transplantation MELD score on post-transplantation patient\nsurvival through a comprehensive, protocol driven systematic\nreview of studies published to date.\nMethods\nIdentification of potentially relevant studies\nTo identify relevant studies published as of August 2011, a\nstructured search strategy combining relevant controlled\nvocabulary terms such as Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)\nand additional non-indexed terms was first developed. Such\nterms included Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, MELD, liver\ntransplantation, liver failure, and survival. The search strategy\nwas applied to the following electronic bibliographic databases:\nPubMed (MEDLINE and non-MEDLINE), the Cochrane Library,\nEMBASE, and Web of Science; and limited to full text, English\nlanguage studies of adult patients which were published within\nthe past 10 years. For completeness, reference lists of relevant\narticles were scanned. Also, an internet search for unpublished\nstudies was performed with the Google® search engine. Full\nsearch details are provided in Table A in File S1.\nSelection of studies for inclusion in the review\nTwo researchers independently screened the titles and\nabstracts of citations identified through the literature search\nusing predetermined inclusion criteria (Table 1). The initial\nsearch strategy identified studies published in the last ten\nyears, whereas only studies published since 2005 were\nincluded in the review.\nSince the purpose of this study was to assess the predictive\nability of MELD in the general transplant patient population,\nstudies focussing on specific subgroups of patients were\nexcluded, along with those involving only unique transplant\nconditions, such as multi-organ transplants, split livers, and\nnon-standard donors. However, studies that considered these\nconditions within the context of the broader transplantation\npopulation were included in the review. Corresponding papers\nof citations deemed potentially relevant were then retrieved for\nfull review. The level of consensus among reviewers was\nassessed using the Kappa Statistic. A score of 0.98 was\nachieved, indicating excellent agreement. Discrepancies\namong reviewers were resolved through discussion without the\nneed for third party adjudication.\nExtraction of data from included studies\nInformation from included studies was systematically\nextracted using a pre-tested data abstraction form. The\nabstraction form contained elements related to study design,\npatient population, comparators, outcomes measured, and\nfindings. All studies were reviewed by the primary author, with\na second reviewer extracting information on 50% of the\nstudies. Reviewers subsequently met to compare results. No\ndiscrepancies were found. Therefore, a second, independent\nreview of the remaining studies was deemed unnecessary.\nCritical appraisal of included studies\nStudies were appraised using the Oxford Center for\nEvidence-based Medicine Levels and Grades of\nRecommendation[3].\nData analysis and synthesis of results\nExtracted data were tabulated to facilitate a comparison of\nfindings across studies. A meta-analysis of pre-transplant\nMELD on post-transplant survival using a random effects\nmodel was also planned (see Results section). Prior to\npresenting pooled or summary estimates, clinical heterogeneity\nand statistical heterogeneity using the I2\n statistic were\nassessed.\nResults\nResults of the literature search are presented in the PRISMA\ndiagram (Figure 1). The search yielded 3058 discrete citations.\nForty-eight full-text articles were retrieved for full consideration,\nof which 37 met the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the review.\nAmong excluded studies, 6 involved inappropriate comparators\nor outcomes, 4 did not present primary data, and 1 contained\ndata already captured in an included study. The list of excluded\nstudies, along with reasons for exclusion, is presented in Table\nB in File S1.\nTable 1.

Instead, studies\nexamined a broad range of pre-transplant factors that may or\nmay not influence survival through exploratory analyses.\nStudies originated from several countries, including: Belgium\n(2), New Zealand (1), the United Kingdom (3), Brazil (6), Spain\n(5), the United States (7), Singapore (1), Turkey (1), China (1),\nKorea (1), Switzerland (1), Poland (1), Italy (3), Canada (1),\nand Germany (3). The majority were single centered. Sample\nsizes ranged from 46 to 21,673 patients (mean = 1451, median\n= 222), most of whom were male. None used a power\ncalculation to determine sample size. Sampling methods\ncomprised consecutive patients who met inclusion/exclusion\ncriteria, which differed considerably across studies. Therefore,\npatients comprising the “general transplant population” may\nhave varied. The point at which MELD was measured in\npatients was inconsistent across studies, with some using time\nof placement on the transplant list and others using time of\ntransplant. In most of the studies, the relationship between\nMELD and survival was examined through stratified analyses\nof survival across sub-groups defined by MELD score, where\nMELD cut-off points for sub-groups were determined post-hoc.\nFurther, the majority(25) measured the association between\nMELD and survival based on univariate analyses alone, and,\ntherefore, did not control for potential confounders. Eleven of\nthe studies assessed the predictive ability of the MELD score\non post-transplantation survival using a receiver operating\ncharacteristic (ROC) curve and the c-statistic. In 4 of the\nstudies, there was partial overlap of patient populations since\nthey included data from the Transplant Scientific Registry\n(Cywinski et al [4], Freeman et al [5], Rana et al [6] and Yoo &\nThuluvath [7]). All of these studies were kept in the review as\neach used different MELD categories and follow-up times in\ntheir analysis. A detailed summary of each study is presented\nin Table C in File S1.\nAs mentioned above, the majority of studies grouped\npatients by MELD. Specifically, MELD, which represents a\ncontinuous variable, was converted to a categorical variable for\nthe analyses. The cut-off points for such categories varied\nwidely across studies and were typically determined post-hoc.\n(Refer to relevant outcome measures in Table C in File S1).\nEffect measures also differed, ranging from proportions to\nhazards ratios, odds ratios, and relative risks, and follow-up\ntime periods were inconsistent. Lastly, characteristics of the\n“general transplant population” varied. Therefore, given such\nclinical heterogeneity across studies, a meta-analysis was\ndeemed inappropriate, and a statistical assessment of\nheterogeneity was not performed.\nQuality of included studies\nBased on the Oxford Center for Evidence-based Medicine\nLevels of Evidence, the quality of all of the included studies\nwas level IV. The studies, which involved a comparison of pre￾Figure 1. Literature search results and study selection for clinical review. \ndoi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0080661.g001\nDoes MELD Predict Post-Transplant Survival?\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 December 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 12 | e80661\n\ntransplant MELD scores with post-transplant survival, were all\ncase series and predominantly retrospective in design. All\nstudies recruited consecutive patients over a specified time\nperiod, thereby reducing the risk of selection bias.\nAssociation between Pre-Transplant MELD Score and\nPost-Transplantation Survival\nOf the 37 studies, 15 found no association between pre￾transplant MELD score and post-transplant patient survival,\nwhile 22 reported poorer survival with higher MELD. A detailed\ndescription of the results of each study is presented in Table C\nin File S1. Based on qualitative analyses, there were no clear\ndifferences in studies with statistically significant findings\ncompared to those with no statistically significant findings. In\nboth groups, sample sizes varied, as did follow-up times.\nHowever, findings from the two largest studies (N >15,000)\nboth suggested that survival decreased with increasing MELD.\nOne observed this relationship only when patients with MELD\nscores under 9 were compared to those with scores of 30 or\ngreater, while the other had treated MELD as a continuous\nvariable. At the same time, of the 7 other studies that analysed\nMELD as a continuous variable, all but one found no\nstatistically significant association between MELD and survival.\nIn most of the studies, information presented on patient\ncharacteristics was limited. Therefore, it was not possible to\nidentify any differences in patient populations that could explain\ninconsistencies in the findings.\nPredictive ability of MELD score for post￾transplantation survival\nEleven studies presented a receiver operating characteristic\n(ROC) curve to determine the predictive ability of pre-transplant\nMELD score to determine post-transplantation survival. The\narea under the curve is used to produce a concordance value\ncalled the c-statistic. A c-statistic of 0.50 indicates no predictive\nability, and is expected if the results are due to chance alone.\nIn contrast, a c-statistic of 1 represents perfect discrimination.\nValues under 0.7 suggest poor predictive power, while those\ngreater than 0.70 indicate a useful test, and those higher than\n0.80 imply excellent predictive accuracy[2]. Among the 11\nstudies, 10 reported c-statistics less than <0.7, indicating that\nMELD poorly predicted post-transplant survival. This included\nthe largest study contributing to the review[6]. In 1 study, the c￾statistic decreased over time, from 0.711 for 3-month post￾transplant survival to 0.679 for 12-month survival[8]. In the\nsingle study with a high c-statistic[9], there was no clear\ndifference in sample size, follow-up time, or patient population\nwhen compared to the studies with lower values.\nDiscussion\nThis review assessed the association and predictive ability of\npre-transplantation MELD score on post-transplantation\nsurvival in adults with end-stage liver disease. It highlighted\ndiscrepancies in findings across studies. Such discrepancies\nmay be related to the nature of the studies, The vast majority\nwere retrospective case series that relied upon exploratory\nstratified analyses of data to detect a relationship between\nMELD and post-transplant survival. As such, analytical\ntechniques, rather than study design, were used to control for\nconfounding. In addition, most of the studies were single\ncentered, with each site having its own process for prioritizing\npatients for transplant. Therefore, patients constituting the\ngeneral transplant population may have varied across studies.\nThus, while using pre-transplant MELD to predict post￾transplant survival in transplant candidates may be attractive,\nthere is little evidence to support it. Prospective studies\ndesigned specifically to examine this relationship are needed.\nMELD score does appear to have a greater impact on mortality\nwhen observed in combination with other known risk factors for\npost-transplant mortality, including sub-optimal livers, low graft￾to-body ratio and presence of Hepatitis C. Further research in\nthe area of particular patient subgroups (such as those with\nhepatitis C) may show a stronger association between MELD\nand post-transplant outcome.\nBased on the studies conducted to date, which collectively\nrepresent a low level of evidence, MELD could be correlated\nwith survival, but appears to have limited predictive ability. The\nvast majority of studies presenting concordance statistics found\nthat pre-transplant MELD score offered minimal discriminating\npower for post-transplantation survival. However, the c-statistic\nmay be of limited value in determining the predictive ability[10].\nThis is because the c-statistic is intended for diagnostic\nmodels, rather than prognostic models. The two types differ in\nthat prognostic models add the element of time. Specifically,\ndiagnostic models are designed to determine the current state\nof the patient and accurately identify an existing disease state.\nIn contrast, prognostic models are designed to estimate the\nprobability of a future state where the outcome is not yet known\nand subject to chance.\nThis review is limited by heterogeneity in key parameters of\nstudies used to date, which precluded performance of a meta￾analysis. Studies reported different comparators (in terms of\nMELD categories) and applied time-points for outcomes.\nStudies comparing standardized MELD categories would be\nbeneficial in determining whether or not there is, in fact, a\nthreshold level at which liver transplantation does not offer\nsufficient survival to warrant the use of scarce donor livers. A\nmore accurate assessment of post-transplant survival would\nalso need to look at other factors, such as quality of life.\nResearch examining the combinations of patient factors using\nmore appropriate statistical techniques may also be valuable in\nimproving the predictive ability of pre-transplant elements on\npost-transplant outcome.\nConclusions\nThis study provides a comprehensive review of recent\narticles examining the relationship between pre-operative\nMELDS score and post-transplantation survival. Based on the\nresults of studies conducted to date, it appears that the use of\nMELD does not serve as a reliable predictor of post￾transplantation survival. This may be a reflection of a reliance\non less than ideal analytical measures. However, the use of\npre-transplant characteristics may always fall short of ensuring\noptimal organ allocation due to variability in immeasurable\nDoes MELD Predict Post-Transplant Survival?\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 December 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 12 | e80661\n\npatient factors and the complexity of perioperative and\npostoperative conditions.\nSupporting Information\nFile S1.

The review included 37 studies, mostly retrospective case series, with varying definitions of MELD categories and follow-up times. While 15 studies found no association between pre-transplant MELD score and post-transplant survival, 22 reported poorer survival with higher MELD. However, the vast majority of studies presented concordance statistics finding that pre-transplant MELD score offered minimal discriminating power for post-transplantation survival. The review suggests that MELD may have a greater impact on mortality when observed in combination with other known risk factors for post-transplant mortality. Overall, the review indicates that MELD may have limited predictive ability for post-transplantation survival, and further research is needed to improve its accuracy. The review highlights the need for studies reporting standardized MELD categories to determine if there is indeed a threshold level at which liver transplantation does not offer sufficient survival to warrant the use of scarce donor livers. Additionally, the review suggests that more accurate assessments of post-transplant survival would require looking at other factors, such as quality of life, and that research examining the combinations of patient factors using more appropriate statistical techniques may improve the predictive ability of pre-transplant elements on post-transplant outcome. Due to heterogeneity in key parameters of studies used to date, a meta-analysis was deemed inappropriate."}

However, evidence\nincreasingly indicates that single tumor cells spread to distant sites much\nearlier than previously believed.In this issue ofthe JCI, Eyles and colleagues\nprovide new insight into the mechanisms underlying early tumor cell dis￾semination,formation of metastases, and tumor immunosurveillance using\ntransgenic mice that spontaneously develop melanomas of the uvea. The\nauthors provide striking evidence that tumor cells start to disseminate dur￾ing the initial steps of tumor development, that late appearing metastases\narise from these early disseminated tumor cells, and thatCD8+ T cells inhibit\nthe growth of disseminated tumor cells, surprisingly, not by cytotoxic effects,\nbut through cytostatic effects.\nBasic aspects of tumor \nimmunosurveillance\nThe original concept of tumor immuno￾surveillance, as stated several decades ago\nby F.M. Burnet and T.R. Prehn (1, 2), pos￾tulated that most malignant tumors that\narise are eliminated via lymphocyte-medi￾ated responses before they become clinical￾ly detectable. Having been abandoned for\ndecades, the concept of tumor immuno￾surveillance has been rekindled by various\nobservations, but its importance remains\nhighly debated. One important contribu￾tion to the debate was the description of\nspecific tumor-associated antigens (3),\nbecause they are a prerequisite to the argu￾ment in favor of tumor-specific immuno￾surveillance. Subsequently, many data have\nrevealed that slowly developing, endog￾enoustumors evade the immune system by\nvarious mechanisms. For example, malig￾nant cell clones can compromise multiple\nimmune functions, including immune\ncell recognition of the tumor and immune\ncell–mediated killing of tumor cells (4–7).\nHowever, in early phases, tumors rarely\ncause harm and are often either ignored\nby the immune system or induce specific\ntolerance (6, 7). To date, the question of\nwhether the immune system can specifi￾cally recognize and control endogenously\ndeveloping tumorsremains widely debated\n(4, 7–9). In this issue of the JCI, Eyles and\ncolleagues provide evidence in a mouse\nmodel of melanoma that tumor immuno￾surveillance not only controls the growth\nof primary malignant tumors, but also\nkeeps metastatic outgrowth in check (10).\nMetastasis: a classical multistep \nprocess, or early dissemination \nof tumor cells?\nThe risk of metastases increases with the\nthickness of a primary tumor. Therefore,\ncurrent tumor biology concepts mainly\npostulate that tumor cell dissemination\noccurs late in tumor development and fol￾lows a classic multistep process (Figure\n1A). First, the primary tumor grows; sec￾ond, tumor cellsinvade the local tissue and\nenter the blood or lymphatic vessels; third,\ntumor cells colonize new sites to cause\nmetastases. Yet increasing amounts of clin￾ical data have revealed that single tumor\ncells spread to distant sites much earlier\nthan previously believed. For example, sin￾gle disseminated tumor cells can be found\nin the lymph nodes or bone marrow of\nhealthy women with a history of early-stage\nbreast cancer that have no clinical evidence\nof metastasis or tumor recurrence (11, 12).\nWomen with such dormant cancer cellslive\nwith an increased risk of sudden metasta￾ses, which may occur more than a decade\nafter primary tumor surgery. Similarly,\nsingle melanoma cells can be found in the\nlymph nodes of patients with thin melano￾mas;these single dormanttumor cellsseem\nto be of prognostic relevance, as patients\ncan develop metastases after more than 10\nyears (13). Nonetheless, more than 90% of\nthese patients remain without metastasis\nfor at least 10 years after surgery.\nThe stealth of tumor cell dissemina￾tion and the extent to which disseminated\ntumor cells can remain dormant is high￾lighted by the inadvertent transmission of\nmelanoma from a patient who served as an\norgan donor following sudden brain death\nto the organ recipients(14). At 2 years after\nthe donor’s kidneys had been transplanted\ninto 2 recipients, both recipients died from\nmetastases of malignant melanoma. The\ndonor had been treated for malignant mel￾anoma 16 years prior to his death, but was\nfree of secondary disease and detectable\nmetastases at the time he died. Thus, even\nthough free of clinical disease, the organ\ndonor had transferred melanoma cells with\nthe graft to the recipients, who rapidly died\nfrom metastasizing melanoma under the\nconditions of transplantation and trans￾plant-associated immunosuppression.\nInsights into the early spread \nof single tumor cells from \nthe leading edge of melanoma\nTransplanted tumor models in rodents are\noften used to study metastasis; however,\nthese models often fail to recapitulate the\nlatency between tumor cell dissemination\nand metastatic outgrowth in humans. Eyles\net al. sought to overcome this issue — in\norder to determine more precisely the role\nof disseminated tumor cellsin the growth of\nmetastases and the mechanisms underlying\ndormancy — using the RET.AAD spontane￾ousmousemodel ofmelanoma,inwhichthe\nhuman RET oncogene is expressed by mela￾nocytes, leading to their oncogenic transfor￾mation (10). They found thatthe firstsingle\ntumor cells tended to spread very early dur￾ing oncogenesis, less than 3 weeks after the\nclinical onset of the primary tumor. At this\ntime,the tumorsshowed no histological evi￾Conflict of interest: The author has declared that no\nconflict of interest exists.\nCitation for this article: J Clin Invest. 2010;\n120(6):1800–1803. doi:10.1172/JCI43424.\n\ncommentaries\nThe Journal of Clinical Investigation      http://www.jci.org      Volume 120      Number 6      June 2010 1801\ndence for invasion of small vessels. Detect￾able metastases became apparent much\nlater in life, up to 1.5 years, which suggests\nthat disseminated tumor cells remained\ndormant for long periods during the life\nof the mice (10). To determine whether the\nmetastaseswere really derived from the early\nspreading tumor cells, or whether they fol￾lowed a classical multistep progression, the\nauthors compared the genomes of primary\ntumors with those of late metastases. Asthe\nlate metastases bore a genetic profile similar\nto that of the primary tumor, and profiles\nwere specific for each individual mouse, it\nseems that the metastases arose from the\nearly disseminated tumor cells (10). Thus,\nboth the early spread of single tumor cells\nand the latency between tumor cell dissemi￾nation and metastatic outgrowth observed\nin humans were modeled in RET.AAD mice\n(Figure 1B).\nEarly tumor cell dissemination reminis￾cent of the events in human metastasis\nhas also been analyzed by Husemann et al.\n(15) in 2 distinct transgenic mouse strains\nthat model breast cancer. Although these\nauthors did not study the latency between\ntumor cell dissemination and metastatic\noutgrowth, they did show that, upon adop￾tive transfer, disseminated tumor cells are\ncapable of homing to the bone marrow\nand causing metastases. It is interesting to\nnote that in these breast cancer models, the\ntumor cells tended to spread to the bone\nmarrow and the lung, whereas in the spon￾taneous melanoma model used by Eyles et\nal., cells spread more diffusely (10). Impor￾tantly, in both studies, apparent meta￾static cells bore the genetic signature of\nearly tumor development (10, 15), further\nunderlining that tumor cell dissemination\nis an early event. The data discussed here\nindicate that tumor cells disseminate to\nFigure 1\nModels of metastasis. (A) Classical multi￾step model of metastasis.

Understanding why these dis￾seminated tumor cells fail to cause early\nmetastasis and what events are responsible\nfor tumor dormancy are key to determin￾ing whether new therapeutic interventions\ncan be developed for the human situation.\nEvidence for immune-mediated \ntumor dormancy in the absence \nof tumor cell killing\nTo uncover potential mechanisms oftumor\ndormancy, Eyles et al. depleted CD8+ T cells\nin RET.AAD mice (10). This T cell depletion\nmarkedly increased the risk of overt metas￾tases, directly showing a critical role for\nT cell–dependent tumor immunosurveil￾lance in the early metastatic stage of this\nmelanoma model. The current view of T\ncell–mediated tumor immunosurveillance\nis that CD8+ T cells control tumor cells\nthrough classic death-inducing mecha￾nisms (5, 9, 10). Although CD8+ T cell\ndepletion was the method used by Eyles et\nal. to uncover a role for T cell–dependent\ntumor immunosurveillance in keeping\ndisseminated tumor cells from forming\nmetastases, the authors present an addi￾tional, surprising piece of data contradict￾ing this classic hypothesis: In the presence\nof CD8+ T cells, the number of Ki67+ tumor\ncells is low, whereas the number of Ki67+\ntumor cells is high in the absence of CD8+\nT cells. As expression of Ki67 is associated\nwith cell proliferation and cell cycle pro￾gression, these data strongly argue that,\nbesides the known cytotoxic effects, a\ncytostatic mode of tumor silencing may be\nkeeping the disseminated tumor cellsfrom\nforming metastases (Figure 1B).\nMüller-Hermelink et al. recently showed\nthat immune-mediated arrest of endog￾enous tumor development is associated\nwith a substantial reduction in tumor cell\nproliferation (16). Using BrdU incorpora￾tion, apoptosis assays, and CD8+ T cell\ndepletion, they found that CD4+ Th1 cells\ncould induce a state of tumor dormancy by\nreducing tumor cell proliferation and cell\ncycle progression through strictly IFN-γ–\nand TNF-dependent signals. Arresting\ntumor growth required neither detectable\nsigns of tumor cell killing nor apoptosis.\nThisisinlinewithotherrecentreportsshow￾ing that T cell immunity can induce tumor\ndormancy with little or no signs of either\ntumor cell killing or apoptosis (17–19).\nIn all of these reports, tumor dormancy\nrequired IFN-γ– or TNF-mediated signal￾ing. Interestingly, thisisin accordance with\nan increasing number ofstudiesin humans\nshowing that immunotherapy with type I\nIFNs or vaccine strategiesthatinduce type II\nIFN–producing Th1 immune responses\nare needed to inhibit tumor progression\nand prolong overall survival (7, 9, 20, 21).\nThe importance of both type I and type II\nIFNs has been extensively studied in experi￾mental mice (9) and is underlined by sur￾prising data from humans as well as from\nexperimental animals: in the absence of\nIFNs or Th1 cells, tumor immunity not\nonly fails to protect against tumors, but\ncan even promote tumor progression (16,\n19, 20). That said, it will be important to\nuncoverthe mechanisms underlying tumor\ndormancy elicited by type I or type II IFNs;\nit has been proposed that antiangiogenic\neffects might contribute, as some tumor\ncells may not express appropriate IFN\nreceptors. Yet, in a number of clinical trials,\nantiangiogenic therapies were less efficient\nthan hoped, and some tumors may even\ndevelop a more aggressive phenotype in the\npresence of antiangiogenic drugs (22). It is\ntherefore unlikely that the tumor-protec￾tive effects of IFNs can be reduced to their\nantiangiogenic effects.\nCan inhibition of cell cycle \nprogression cause tumor dormancy?\nToday it is known that disseminated single\ntumor cells rarely cause metastases, and if\nthey do, it is frequently many years after\nthey reached their distant site. However,\nthe mechanisms underlying tumor dor￾mancy remain a major mystery. Müller￾Hermelink et al. (16) and Eyles et al. (10)\nindependently found that tumorimmuno￾surveillance correlated with a substantial\nreduction in either BrdU+ or Ki67+ tumor\ncells, key findings characteristic of inhibi￾tion of cell proliferation and cell cycle pro￾gression, and that tumor-specific T cells\nprevented tumor growth in the absence\nof histological evidence for major tumor\ncell killing or apoptosis. It is therefore dif￾ficult to imagine that the immune system\ncontrols disseminated tumor cells only\nby mechanisms of direct killing; rather,\nit is likely that immunosurveillance also\ninduces tumor dormancy through other\nmechanisms that are still poorly inves￾tigated. IFNs and TNF both are not only\ninvolved in killing and apoptosis; they\nhave pleiotropic effects on the metabolism\nof somatic cells through the control of\nsignaling cascades that regulate cell prolif￾eration and cell cycle progression and the\ncontrol of signaling molecules that influ￾ence cell differentiation and the process\nof transformation (9, 10, 16). Therefore,\nimmunosurveillance may indeed induce\ndormancy in single, disseminated tumor\ncells by arresting their cell cycle through\ncytokine-mediated signals. This would\nalso explain why late metastases mightstill\nbear the genetic signature of early dissemi￾nated tumor cells (10, 15).\nPerspectives\nThese insights, arising from a number of\nobservations in mice and humans, reveal\nthat the classical immunological con￾cept of tumor eradication by tumor cell\nkilling should be abandoned. They raise\nimportant questions that should affect\nthe design of future immune therapies.\nIf single tumor cells emigrate early, why\ndo overt metastases appear only at later\ntumor stages? Is this a question of quan￾tity, or are there specific signals? How does\nthe immune system controlsingle, dissem￾inated tumor cells and micrometastasis\nand establish tumor dormancy, and what\nawakens disseminated tumor cells and\nmakes them grow into metastases?\nAcknowledgments\nIthank H.

Heeger2\n1Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA. 2Recanati Miller Transplantation Institute, New York, New York, USA.\nKidney transplantation is the optimal therapy for end-stage kidney disease\nbut requires lifelong immunosuppression. Despite improvements in immu￾nosuppression regimens that have reduced rates of acute transplant rejec￾tion, long-term allograft survival remains suboptimal. More than 50% of\ntransplanted kidneys from deceased donors fail within 10 years. In order to\nimprove long-term outcomes, physicians need to better understand mecha￾nisms underlying transplant rejection and tolerance in humans. They also\nneed biomarkers that differentiate patients likely to maintain excellent and\nstable allograft function from recipients at risk of losing their transplants.\nBy studying kidney transplant recipients at high risk for graft loss and rare,\nspontaneously tolerant kidney transplant recipients, researchers reporting\nin 3 papers in this issue of the JCI shed new light on these topics.\nLate graft failure after kidney \ntransplantation\nKidney transplantation is the most com￾mon solid organ transplant procedure car￾ried out in the US; more than 16,000 such\ntransplants were performed in 2009 (1).\nAdvances in immunosuppression over the\npast 2 decades have drastically reduced the\nincidence of acute T cell–mediated rejec￾tion episodes, but have not significantly\nimproved long-term allograft survival\n(2). The actual half-life for a transplanted\nkidney from a deceased donor (the most\ncommon source of kidneys for transplan￾tation) is only 8 years (2), and as few as\none-third of kidney allografts obtained\nfrom older donors remain function￾ing 10 years later (3). Allograft dysfunc￾tion can result in the need for a further\ntransplant and is a strong independent\npredictor of recipient cardiovascular\nmortality (4). Late graft loss is commonly\ncaused by chronic allograft nephropa￾thy, characterized by tissue fibrosis and\ntubular atrophy (5). Among the factors\nknown to contribute to its pathogenesis\nare uncontrolled alloimmune reactivity\n(T cell– and/or antibody-mediated injury),\nrecurrent primary renal disease, hyper￾tension, diabetes, and drug toxicity. With\nregard to the latter, kidney toxicity as a\nresult of long-term treatment with the\nimmunosuppressive agents tacrolimus or\ncyclosporine is detectable in virtually all\ntransplanted kidneys (6).\nAlthough research progress hasimproved\nour knowledge of the prevalence, clinical\nsignificance, and pathogenesis of chron￾ic kidney allograft injury, research has\nnot yet influenced therapeutic decision\nmaking to improve outcomes. Currently,\nposttransplant care, including immuno￾suppression, is protocol driven. Altera￾tions in drug dosing are made based on\ncenter-derived protocols and physician\nexperience. Because chronic injury is mul￾tifactorial, a one-size-fits-all approach\nis not ideal. To develop individual thera￾peutic approaches tailored to individual\npatients, transplant physicians need risk\nassessment tools that can discriminate\nspecific pathogenic mechanisms, prospec￾tively identify those transplant recipients\ndestined to have excellent graft function,\nrecognize those recipients at high risk for\ngraft loss, and ultimately guide specific\nchanges in therapy.

Heeger\nDepartment of Medicine, Recanati Miller Transplant Institute and Immunology Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.\nImprovements in clinical care and immunosuppressive medications have positively affected outcomes following \nkidney transplantation, but graft survival remains suboptimal, with half-lives of approximately 11 years. Late graft \nloss results from a confluence of processes initiated by ischemia-reperfusion injury and compounded by effector \nmechanisms of uncontrolled alloreactive T cells and anti-HLA antibodies. When combined with immunosuppres￾sant toxicity, post-transplant diabetes and hypertension, and recurrent disease, among other factors, the result \nis interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and graft failure. Emerging evidence over the last decade unexpectedly \nidentified the complement cascade as a common thread in this process. Complement activation and function \naffects allograft injury at essentially every step. These fundamental new insights, summarized herein, provide the \nfoundation for testing the efficacy of various complement antagonists to improve kidney transplant function and \nlong-term graft survival.\nIntroduction\nKidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for end-stage \nkidney disease. Advances in immunosuppression, HLA matching, \nand improvements in medical care have reduced acute rejection \nrates to less than 10%, but long-term graft survival remains sub￾optimal, as kidney transplant half-lives are only 8 to 11 years (1). \nAs a consequence, the extension of allograft survival is one current \nfocus of transplant research. An improved understanding of the \npathophysiology of acute and chronic allograft injury will likely \nguide development and implementation of novel therapies capa￾ble of prolonging kidney transplant survival.\nCurrent concepts are that kidney transplant injury is initiated by \nsurgical trauma and the requisite associated ischemia-reperfusion \n(IR) injury, the latter being particularly detrimental in recipients of \ndeceased donor allografts. IR rates following transplantation are \nincreasing (2), and kidney graft survival is worse in recipients with \nsignificant IR injury (3). Donor-reactive T cells and anti-HLA anti￾bodies are established mediators of transplant injury and must \nbe controlled by appropriate immunosuppression. Inadequate \nimmunosuppression predisposes to acute cellular rejection and \nantidonor HLA alloantibody formation, both of which are asso￾ciated with progressive interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy \n(IF/TA) and shortened graft survival (4–6). In contrast, excessive \nimmunosuppression not only predisposes to infectious compli￾cations, but is associated with multiple toxicities including direct \nkidney damage (7) and indirect effects of drug-induced diabetes \n(8) and hypertension (9).\nEmerging evidence over the past 15 years supports the concept \nthat the complement cascade, traditionally considered a compo￾nent of innate immunity, unexpectedly regulates kidney IR injury, \nT cell and humoral alloimmunity that underlie transplant rejec￾tion, and progressive kidney injury that results in late graft failure. \nThis body of literature, to be reviewed herein, suggests that comple￾ment components produced by the liver as well as by kidney cells \nand immune cells play crucial roles as pathogenic mediators of \ntransplant rejection in animals and humans. The data support the \nneed for further efficacy testing of targeting complement and/or \nits receptors to improve kidney transplant outcome in humans.\nOverview of the complement cascade\nThe complement system is composed of over 30 soluble and mem￾brane-bound proteins that are activated as a cascade by three initi￾ating pathways: (a) the lectin pathway triggered by carbohydrates \npresent on bacteria surface, (b) the classical pathway triggered by \ncross-linking, cell-bound subclasses of IgG and IgM antibodies, \nand (c) the alternative pathway that undergoes spontaneous acti￾vation on cell surfaces (Figure 1 and ref. 10).\nThe three pathways converge to form C3 convertases, multim￾eric protein complexes with enzymatic activity (10). Cleavage of \nC3 yields C3a and C3b, the latter of which triggers formation of \nthe C5 convertase. Subsequent C5 cleavage initiates formation of \nthe membrane attack complex (MAC, C5b-9) on the target cells. In \naddition to the MAC, soluble and surface-bound split products, \nincluding C3a, C3b, iC3b, C3dg, and C5a, mediate inflammation \nby directly lysing target cells, serving as chemoattractants, func￾tioning as opsonins, and activating innate immune cells such as \nmacrophages and neutrophils (11).\nComplement activation is tightly regulated (Figure 1) so as \nto prevent bystander damage to self cells (11). This regulation is \naccomplished through the expression of membrane-bound and \nsoluble complement–regulating proteins. Decay accelerating fac￾tor (DAF or CD55) is a glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored, mem￾brane-bound complement regulator that accelerates the decay of \ncell surface–assembled C3 convertases. DAF limits downstream \ncomplement activation and restricts production of the afore￾mentioned cleavage products (12). Notably, DAF only functions \nintrinsically, limiting complement activation on the cell surface \nupon which it is expressed, but not on proximally located patho￾gens, which lack DAF expression. Human CD46 (murine homolog \nCrry), also known as membrane cofactor protein (MCP), has simi￾lar decay-accelerating function, but also exhibits cofactor activity. \nIn conjunction with soluble factor I, this membrane-bound regula￾tor inactivates C3b to iC3b, thereby preventing re-formation of the \nC3 convertase. Other examples of complement regulators include \nConflict of interest: Peter S.

Comple￾ment proteins are also generated by tissue-resident (e.g., tubular \ncells in the kidney, ref. 13) and migratory/immune cells, including \nT cells and APCs (14). Theoretically, non–liver cell–derived com￾plement could activate and function locally without affecting sys￾temic complement activation.\nComplement and IR injury\nThe pathophysiology of post-transplant IR injury and delayed \ngraft function (DGF) has been reviewed elsewhere in detail (15). \nBriefly, IR injury results from tissue hypoxia, mitochondrial dam￾age, and ATP depletion, followed by the generation of free oxy￾gen radicals upon reperfusion, which initially damage endothe￾lium. Ensuing inflammation driven by TLR signaling and locally \nsecreted cytokines, chemokines, and complement amplify the \ninflammation, resulting in tubular injury and kidney dysfunction.\nEarly evidence implicating a role for complement in IR injury \nderived from mouse models in which complement deposition and \nloss of membrane-bound complement regulators were described \nduring kidney IR injury and overexpression of Crry ameliorated \nIR injury (16, 17). IR injury was later shown to be dampened in \ncomplement-depleted mice (18, 19) and in C3-deficient (16, 19), \nfactor B-deficient (20) or C5-deficient (21) mice, while mice \ndeficient in DAF (22) or in Crry and factor H (23, 24) (in which \nrestraint on complement activation is lifted) were more suscep￾tible to IR injury. Strikingly, IR injury studies performed in ani￾mals following transplantation of WT or C3-deficient kidneys \ninto syngeneic WT or C3-deficient recipients showed that donor \nkidney–derived C3, and not systemic recipient C3, is the predom￾inant mediator of IR injury (25).\nPeng et al. (26) used C3a receptor– (C3aR-), C5aR-, and C3aR/\nC5aR-deficient mice and models of renal IR injury to demonstrate \nthat deficiency of either or both of these receptors protected mice \nfrom injury. The C3aR/C5aR- and C5aR-deficient mice were most \nprotected. Studies performed in BM chimeras showed that the \nabsence of C3aR and C5aR on either renal tubular epithelial cells \nor circulating leukocytes attenuated renal IR injury, indicating \nthat expression of C3aR and C5aR on both renal cells and circulat￾Figure 1\nSchematic representation of the complement cascade.

Subsequent cleavage \nand assembly of C4 and then C2 form the C4bC2b C3 convertase. C3 spontaneously binds to H2O, forming C3(H2O), which binds to cell sur￾faces and initiates factor B–dependent (fB-dependent) and fD-dependent assembly of the alternative pathway C3 convertase (C3bBb). The \nlatter cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b, amplifying complement activation. Addition of a second C3b molecule to either C3 convertase forms the C5 \nconvertase, which cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b. C5b, in conjunction with C6 to C9, comprises the MAC. C3b functions as an opsonin, whereas \nC3a and C5a have inflammatory and chemotactic properties. DAF (CD55) and MCP (CD46) are cell surface–expressed complement regulators \nthat accelerate the decay of all surface-assembled C3 convertases, thereby limiting amplification of the downstream cascade. MCP and fH also \nhave cofactor activity: in conjunction with soluble fI, they irreversibly cleave C3b to iC3b, thereby preventing re-formation of the C3 convertase. \nCD59 inhibits formation of the MAC.\n\nreview series\n2350 The Journal of Clinical Investigation   http://www.jci.org   Volume 124   Number 6   June 2014\ning leukocytes contributes to the pathogenesis of renal IR injury. \nIn these studies, protection from injury was associated with less \ncellular infiltration and lower mRNA levels of kidney injury mol￾ecule-1, proinflammatory mediators, and adhesion molecules in \npost-ischemic kidneys. One specific mechanism is that C3a pro￾duced in response to IR injury drives renal tubular epithelial cell \nproduction of chemokines (27). Together, the animal model data \nsupport the conclusion that IR injury upregulates production of \ncomplement components by kidney endothelial and tubular cells \nas well as by infiltrating immune cells. Local activation through \nthe alternative pathway yields C3a and C5a, which amplify local \ninflammation and injury through autocrine and paracrine liga￾tions with their receptors expressed on cells in the graft.\nA role for complement activation in human IR injury was eval￾uated by de Vries et al. (28). These investigators detected soluble \nC5b-9 following reperfusion of deceased donor but not living \ndonor kidneys. Whole genome expression profiling of 53 human \nrenal allograft protocol biopsies obtained at implantation con￾firmed significantly higher expression levels of complement genes \nin deceased donor kidneys (29). Extending these findings prior to \nsurgical removal of the donor organ, van Werkhoven et al. found \nthat brain death initiates systemic complement activation, upreg￾ulates C5aR expression in renal tubular cells (30), and is associated \nwith induction of intrarenal inflammatory cytokines. The authors \nhypothesized that complement activation that occurs in the donor \naccounts in part for the poorer outcomes of grafts harvested from \ndeceased compared with living donors.\nThe recognition that complement participates in the pathogene￾sis of post-transplant IR injury has prompted investigators to test \nwhether complement inhibitors are effective therapies. An analog \nof the human complement-regulatory protein CD35 (CR1; blocks \ncomplement activation at the C3 convertase step) has been con￾jugated to a myristoylated peptidyl tail, such that when admin￾istered by intravenous perfusion of the harvested organ ex vivo it \nwill self-insert into the lipid bilayer of the EC membranes (31). \nPatel et al. used this approach to show that the reagent was effec￾tive in preventing post-transplant kidney IR injury in a rat model \n(32). The human reagent mirococept (APT070) is currently being \nstudied in a clinical trial for prevention of DGF (31). Eculizumab \n(Soliris; Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc.), a humanized anti-C5 mAb \nthat is FDA approved to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobi￾nuria is also being tested for efficacy in preventing post-transplant \nDGF (NCT01403389; NCT01919346).\nThe aforementioned findings indicating that brain death is asso￾ciated with complement activation in the donor kidney prior to \norgan removal raise the intriguing concept that complement inhi￾bition in the donor could be an effective prophylactic therapy to \nprevent IR injury. Innovative study designs involving randomized \ntreatment of organ donors and collaborations between organ pro￾curement agencies and multiple transplant centers will need to be \ndeveloped to test this possibility.\nComplement and alloreactive T cells\nComplement and effector T cells. Building upon the paradigm-shifting \nobservation published in 2002 that WT mice do not reject allog￾rafts from C3-deficient donors (33), work from several groups, \nincluding ours, uncovered an unexpected role for complement as a \nregulator of T cell immunity. During cognate interactions between \nT cells and APCs, both partners upregulate and secrete alternative \npathway complement components C3, fB, and fD, as well as the \ncommon pathway protein C5, and upregulate surface expression \nof C3aR and C5aR (34, 35). These changes are a consequence of \ncostimulatory molecule signaling via CD28/CD80/CD86 and \nCD154/CD40 (35), which simultaneously and transiently reduce \ncell surface–expressed DAF (thereby lifting restraint on comple￾ment activation). Locally produced C3a and C5a bind to their \nreceptors and function as autocrine and paracrine stimulators of \nthe T cell and the APC (34, 35). Signaling via these GPCRs in T cells \nactivates PI3Kγ and induces phosphorylation of the intracellular \nsignaling molecule AKT (14, 35), upregulating the antiapoptotic \nprotein Bcl2 and downregulating expression of the proapoptotic \nmolecule Fas. Together, these complement-dependent mechanisms \nenhance T cell proliferation and diminish T cell apoptosis (14). The \nevidence also indicates that C3aR and C5aR signaling is required \nfor T cell homeostasis, as T cells deficient in both receptors spon￾taneously undergo accelerated cell death in vitro and in vivo (35).\nOn DCs and macrophages, C3a/C3aR and C5a/C5aR ligations \ninduce upregulation and release of innate cytokines (e.g., IL-12, \nIL-23) and costimulatory molecules (e.g., CD80, CD86) (35–38). \nAPCs deficient in C5aR/C3aR or C3 produce less IL-12, express \nlower levels of CD80, and are weaker T cell stimulators than WT \nAPCs, while DCs and macrophages obtained from mice genetically \ndeficient in DAF produce more IL-12 and induce stronger T cell \nresponses than cells from WT animals (35–38). Independent of the \nphenotype of the APC, T cells deficient in C3aR and C5aR signal￾ing respond poorly to WT and Daf1–/– APCs and undergo acceler￾ated cell death (14, 35).\nAlloresponses are dampened in WT chimeric mouse recipients \nof C3–/– BM, despite normal serum complement. In contrast, \nC3-deficient chimeric hosts repopulated with WT BM exhibited \nnormal T cell alloreactivity (14, 39). Analogously, BM chimeras \nproduced using C5aR-deficient donors or recipients confirmed \nthat T cell immunity is dependent on C5aR expression on BM￾derived cells (14, 39).\nComplement and T cell–mediated rejection. Studies performed in \ntransplant models revealed WT mice reject Daf1–/– heart allografts \nwith accelerated kinetics (39), and that the accelerated rejection is \ndue to a complement-dependent augmentation of antidonor T cell \nimmunity. Collaborative work additionally showed that donor or \nrecipient DAF deficiency accelerates skin graft rejection (34) and \novercomes the immune privilege of the eye by enhancing patho￾genic T cell alloimmunity induced by normally tolerogenic corneal \ntransplants, resulting in rapid corneal rejection (40).\nCD8+ T cells, the principal mediators of solid organ transplant \nrejection, require helper signals derived from CD4+ T cells in \norder to become optimal pathogenic effector cells (CD4-defi￾cient mice do not reject cardiac allografts; ref. 41). Current con￾cepts regarding how CD4+ T cells help alloreactive CD8+ T cells \nare that during cognate TCR/APC interactions, CD154 expressed \non CD4+ T cells transmits activating signals to APCs through \nligation with CD40 (42, 43). This in turn upregulates costimula￾tory molecule (CD80/86) and MHC expression on the APC and \ninduces proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-12), which together \nfacilitate optimal CD8+ T cell activation, expansion, differentia￾tion, and survival. Building upon previous findings linking com￾plement to T cell activation, our research group provided exper￾imental evidence, using in vivo transplant models, that immune \ncell–derived complement is a crucial molecular intermediary \nunderlying how CD4 cells provide help to alloreactive CD8+ T \ncells required for rejection (44).\n\nreview series\nThe Journal of Clinical Investigation   http://www.jci.org   Volume 124   Number 6   June 2014 2351\nLocal complement production also influences effector CD8+\nT cell responses to allogeneic vascular ECs (45). Experiments \nperformed using in vitro culture systems and in vivo heart trans￾plantation models showed that complement is produced by ECs \nand regulates T cell function and expansion (46). The effects of \nEC-derived complement are transmitted in part through C5aR \nsignaling on T cells (45).\nC5a/C5aR interactions also modulate T cell–dependent kidney \ntransplant rejection in rodents (47). Together with the findings \nthat anti-C5 mAb synergizes with CTLA4-Ig to prevent T cell \npriming, limits T cell trafficking to an allograft, and prolongs \ntransplant survival in mice (48), the body of work supports the \nconclusion that complement is a physiologically important regu￾lator of pathogenic T cell immunity that causes allograft rejection \nin animal models.\nImportant confirmatory human experiments published in 2013 \nshowed that C3a and C5a are generated during in vitro cultures \nof human T cells responding to allogeneic DCs (49). Both part￾ners express the receptors for C3a and C5a (50–53), and C3aR \nand C5aR antagonists inhibit human T cell proliferation (49). \nRecombinant C3a/C5a promote human CD4+ T cell expansion, \nbypassing the inhibitory effects of CTLA4-Ig, and inducing AKT \nphosphorylation. Lowering human DC C3a/C5a production by \nsiRNA knockdown of DC-expressed C3 reduces human T cell \nalloresponses. Conversely, downregulating DC expression of DAF \nincreases immune cell C3a/C5a and augments human alloreac￾tive T cell proliferation, identifying APCs as the dominant com￾plement source (49). In vitro studies by Zhou et al. also showed \nthat different subsets of human DCs produce complement, and \nthat C5aR/C3aR signaling regulates DC activation and function \n(54). Pharmacological C5aR blockade reduced human anti-mouse \ngraft-versus-host disease (GVHD) scores and inhibited T cell \nresponses in NOD/SCID/γcnull mouse recipients of human periph￾eral blood mononuclear cells, verifying that the C5aR-dependent \neffects on human T cells apply in vivo (49).\nIn further support of the clinical relevance of local complement \nin human transplantation, the quantity of RNA message for alter￾native pathway complement components and complement recep￾tors, including C5aR and C3aR, is higher in human allograft biop￾sies with histologic evidence of rejection compared to non-injured \ncontrol tissue (47, 55).\nComplement and Tregs. Tregs are instrumental for tolerance induc￾tion and maintenance (56) in rodents and are associated with \nimproved long-term transplant outcomes in humans (56, 57). \nData published in 2013 indicated that complement also regulates \nTreg induction, function, and stability (58, 59). Our laboratory \ndemonstrated that peripheral murine natural Tregs (nTregs) \nexpress C3aR and C5aR, and that signaling through these recep￾tors inhibits Treg function (60). Genetic and pharmacologic block￾ade of C3aR/C5aR signal transduction in nTregs augments their \nin vitro and in vivo suppressive activity, abrogates autoimmune \ncolitis, and prolongs allogeneic skin graft survival. Mechanisms \ninvolve C3a/C5a-induced phosphorylation of AKT and, as a conse￾quence, phosphorylation of the transcription factor Foxo1, which \nresults in lowered nTreg Foxp3 expression. Two additional sets of \ndata showed that genetic deficiency or pharmacologic blockade \nof C3aR/C5aR signaling augments murine induced Treg (iTreg) \ngeneration, stabilizes Foxp3 expression, resists iTreg conversion \nto IFN-γ/TNF-α–producing effector T cells, and as a consequence, \nlimits the clinical expression of GVHD (58, 59).\nImmune cell–derived complement also modulates human Treg \ngeneration and function (58, 61). Pharmacologic antagonists to \nhuman C3aR and C5aR augment in vitro generation and stabil￾ity of human iTreg from naive precursors. In NOD/SCID/γcnull\nmouse recipients of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, \nwe showed that pharmacologic C5aR blockade enhances human \niTreg generation and stability and results in better disease protec￾tion (61). These clinically relevant translational findings provide \nproof of concept that C3a/C3aR and C5a/C5aR ligations are viable \ntargets for facilitating iTreg-mediated transplant tolerance.\nBuilding upon previously published evidence that coengage￾ment of the TCR and the complement regulator CD46 promote \nregulatory IL-10 production (62), these new results underscore \nthe crucial role of complement in modulating the balance between \npathogenic and protective adaptive T cell responses. Whether com￾plement antagonists can therapeutically control T cell alloreactiv￾ity while simultaneously promoting Treg induction, function, and \nstability in transplant patients remains to be determined. Anti-C5 \nmAb and C5aR antagonists are currently being tested in humans \nfor other indications, providing opportunities to assess their \neffects on human alloreactive T cells in vivo (NCT01363388).\nComplement and antibody-mediated transplant injury\nDonor reactive anti-HLA antibodies are generally accepted as \npathogenic mediators of acute and chronic transplant injury \n(63). It has been known for decades that complement depletion \nimpairs antibody production (64). One mechanism involves anti￾gen-bound C3dg (a C3b cleavage product; see Figure 1) binding to \nB cell–expressed complement receptor 2 (CD21), which facilitates \nantigen presentation to B cells and lowers the threshold for B cell \nactivation (65, 66). Isotype switching in B cells that results in IgG \nproduction is dependent upon T follicular helper (TFH) cell/B cell \ninteractions (reviewed in ref. 67), transmitted in part by IL-21/\nIL-21 receptor, and CD40/CD154, ligations. As outlined above, \nT cell immunity is regulated by locally produced complement, \nindicating that complement could impact antibody production \nindirectly through regulating T cell immunity. To our knowledge, \nthere are no data addressing whether complement specifically \nalters induction, function, or stability of TFH cells. Regardless of \nthe specific mechanism, C3-deficient mice fail to produce high￾affinity IgG responses against major histocompatibility antigens \nin skin grafts (68), demonstrating the relevance of complement’s \ninfluence over antibody formation in response to transplant anti￾gens. Whether complement blockade impacts anti-HLA antibody \nformation in human transplant recipients has not been tested.\nOnce produced, anti-HLA antibodies can bind to donor tissue and \nmediate damage through multiple mechanisms including those that \nare complement dependent (69). An unequivocal role for alloanti￾body-initiated, complement-dependent human kidney transplant \ninjury was first documented in the 1969 Terasaki article (70), in which \nthe authors showed that patients with serum containing antibody \ncapable of inducing complement-dependent donor cell lysis strongly \npredicted hyperacute kidney transplant rejection. The importance of \ncomplement as an effector mechanism of antibody-initiated allograft \ninjury was illustrated by studies using anti-C5 mAb in presensitized \nmurine allograft recipients (71). These experiments revealed that \ninhibition of the C5 convertase, in combination with cyclosporine \nand short-term cyclophosphamide treatment, prevented acute rejec￾tion and resulted in prolonged allograft survival despite persistent \nantidonor IgG in the sera and in the graft (71). Extending the ther-\n\nreview series\n2352 The Journal of Clinical Investigation   http://www.jci.org   Volume 124   Number 6   June 2014\napeutic approach to humans, the anti-human C5 mAb eculizumab \nplus plasma exchange reduced the incidence of antibody-mediated \nrejection in 26 sensitized kidney transplant recipients compared \nwith a historical control group of 51 patients treated with a plasma \nexchange–based protocol alone (72). Anti-C5 mAb also successfully \nreversed established antibody-mediated rejection (73). In light of the \nassociation between anti-HLA antibodies and chronic antibody-medi￾ated graft rejection, ongoing studies are testing the efficacy of eculi￾zumab in preventing graft loss in kidney transplant recipients with \ndonor-specific antibodies (NCT01327573).\nFrom a diagnostic/biomarker standpoint, investigators hypothe￾sized that detection of serum anti-HLA antibodies capable of bind￾ing C1q would enhance the prognostic utility of serum alloantibody \nanalysis in kidney transplantation (74, 75). The latest iteration of \nthe single antigen bead technology currently used for detecting \nanti-HLA antibodies (76) additionally identifies those antibodies \nthat bind C1q. A 2013 population-based study of 1,016 kidney \ntransplant recipients suggested that, among patients with anti-HLA \nantibodies, those that were C1q+ had the worst graft survival (77).\nColvin and colleagues pioneered the use of C4d staining in graft \ntissue as a diagnostic test for antibody-mediated allograft rejection \n(AMR) (78). C4d is an activation byproduct of classical pathway \ncomplement activation and its detection in graft tissue is more \nsensitive than detection of immunoglobulin. As a consequence, \nC4d staining has become a valuable tool for diagnosing AMR. \nImportantly, diagnostic sensitivity depends on staining method￾ology and cases of C4d– AMR have been described (79).\nComplement and kidney graft injury and fibrosis\nMechanisms of late graft failure are complex and involve immune \nand non-immune mechanisms (80), but late graft loss routinely \nresults in pathological evidence of progressive glomerulosclerosis, \nFigure 2\nOverview of pathogenic mechanisms linking complement to kidney transplant injury. (A) During cognate interactions between alloreactive T \ncells and APCs, alternative pathway complement components are released and undergo activation, yielding C3a and C5a. Upon binding to their \nrespective G protein–coupled receptors, these anaphylatoxins stimulate PKA and induce PI3Kγ-dependent pAKT, together amplifying alloreactive \nTh1 T cell expansion and inhibiting Treg induction, function, and stability, thus facilitating acute and chronic graft rejection. (B) The antigen-bound \ncomplement degradation product C3dg binds to B cell–expressed CR2, lowering the threshold for B cell activation and antibody production. \nComplement may indirectly enhance antibody production by augmenting T cell help (not shown). Classical pathway–dependent, complement￾mediated effector mechanisms initiated by cross-linking tissue-bound, donor-reactive (IgG) antibodies also contribute to allograft injury. Insertion \nof the MAC into the EC results in EC activation. C3a and C5a mediate chemoattraction and activation of polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells, which, \nthrough Fc receptors, ligate Fc portions of antibodies bound to endothelium, contributing to injury. (C) IR leads to the production of ROS, which \nin turn promote release of DAMPs, including HMGB1, chemokines, cytokines, and complement components, by ECs and tubular and infiltrating \ncells. Through alternative complement pathway activation, locally generated C3a and C5a contribute to EC and tubular cell activation and injury, \nenhancing inflammation and graft immunogenicity. (D) Locally produced (intragraft) and activated complement contributes to progressive injury \nand fibrosis, in part through stimulating the renin angiotensin system and driving epithelial-mesenchymal transition.\n\nreview series\nThe Journal of Clinical Investigation   http://www.jci.org   Volume 124   Number 6   June 2014 2353\nIF/TA, and arteriosclerosis (81, 82). The functional and structural \nchanges of chronic renal allograft failure share similarities with \nthose observed in other forms of chronic progressive kidney dis￾ease, in which decline of functioning nephron mass has been con￾sidered the key event (83).\nUnexpectedly, several pieces of evidence suggest that intragraft \ncomplement activation contributes to this progressive kidney \ninjury. C3–/– kidney isografts transplanted into WT recipients were \nprotected from toxin-induced tubular damage, proteinuria, and \nprogressive renal failure, despite the presence of abundant circu￾lating C3 (84). Follow-up work showed that C3 is implicated in \nthe activation of the renin-angiotensin system and in the epitheli￾al-to-mesenchymal transition (85, 86), supporting the concept that \nsynthesis of complement components by renal epithelial cells is one \ncritical mediator of tubular damage in proteinuria-associated renal \ndisease. As proteinuria is one hallmark of kidney graft dysfunction \n(87), these results raise the possibility that kidney-derived comple￾ment participates in the development of IF/TA after transplant.\nIndirect associative evidence linking complement to progressive \ntransplant injury derives from studies of complement gene poly￾morphisms and transplant outcomes in humans. Specific C5 poly￾morphisms in both the donor and the recipient have been asso￾ciated with worse late graft function, but interestingly not with \nthe risk of acute rejection (88). Although controversial, some addi￾tional evidence suggests that donor kidney expression of a specific \npolymorphic variant of C3 is associated with worse post-trans￾plant outcomes (89, 90). In further support of the concept that \nintragraft complement production modulates progressive kidney \ninjury, proteomic studies of kidney allograft tissue by the Salomon \ngroup demonstrated strong associations between IF/TA and the \nalternative pathway, but not the classical pathway, complement \ncomponents (91). An ongoing study of chronic anti-C5 mAb ther￾apy in kidney transplant recipients (NCT01327573) could poten￾tially provide further insight into the role of complement as a \nmediator of progressive graft dysfunction and IF/TA.\nConclusions\nThe complement system is now firmly established as a pervasive, \nmultifaceted mediator of transplant injury in animal models, \nand studies from multiple groups have largely confirmed that \nthese newly recognized mechanisms apply to human transplant \nrecipients (Figure 2). This success of translational immunol￾ogy, along with the development of pharmacologic agents that \nblock human complement components and receptors (92, 93), \nnow allows for testing of the intriguing concept that targeting \ncomplement in kidney transplant recipients will improve graft \nsurvival and patient health.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by NIH grants AI43578 and AI071185 \nawarded to P.S.

To date, \nno information is available on monocyte–macrophage-related cellular shifts and their \npolarization status during rejection.

Fibrosis was investigated using Sirius Red stainings of rejection, non-rejection, \nand 1-year biopsies.

Monocytes in Heart Transplant Rejection\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org March 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 346\nINTRODUCTION\nDuring acute cellular heart transplant rejection, infiltration of \nlymphocytes and monocytes is followed by endothelial injury, \nstructural tissue damage, and eventually myocardial fibrosis \n(1). Not only T-cells but also monocyte-/macrophage lineage \ncells are abundantly present in the rejecting heart (2, 3). To date, \nthe rejection-related monocyte–macrophage subset profiles in \nboth tissue and blood compartment are not yet defined in heart \ntransplant recipients. It is also unclear whether rejection-related \nchanges of monocyte–macrophage subsets on tissue level are \nreflected in circulation.\nExpression of CD14 (LPS co-receptor) and CD16 (Fcγ receptor \nIII) define three phenotypically and functionally distinct human \nmonocyte subsets: CD14++CD16− (classical), CD14++CD16+\n(intermediate), and CD14+CD16++ (non-classical) monocytes \n(4). The CD16+ monocytes are considered pro-inflammatory due \nto production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and \nIL-1β compared to classical monocytes (4, 5). Higher expression \nof HLA-DR, CD86, and CD54 (ICAM-1) distinguish CD16+\nmonocytes from the classical ones.\nMonocytes are important in many inflammatory diseases. \nCoronary artery disease patients have higher numbers of \nmonocytes compared to healthy cohorts (6, 7). Local biphasic \nmonocyte accumulation was observed following acute myocar￾dial infarction (8, 9). The monocytes, located in the infarct border \nzone during the inflammatory phase after infarction, consisted \nmainly of CD14+CD16− cells, whereas during the proliferative \nphase, the monocytes in the infarct core showed comparable \npercentages of CD14+CD16− and CD14+CD16+. Different \nmacrophage populations are also observed following myocardial \ninfarction with pro-inflammatory cells early on followed by \nreparative macrophages (9).\nRelated to the state of activation, macrophages can be function￾ally grouped into two main classes: the M1 (pro-inflammatory) \nand the M2 (anti-inflammatory), although an increasing number \nof different phenotypes with intermediate and contrasting features \nhave been described recently (10). Classically, the M1 macrophages \ncan be induced after stimulation of monocytes with IFN-γ and \nmainly have phagocytic, anti-microbial, and pro-inflammatory \nfunctions (11). On the other hand, M2 macrophages are induced \nafter monocyte-stimulation with modulating factors such as \nIL-4/IL-13, immune complexes, or glucocorticoids and are phe￾notypically characterized by expression of CD163, CD206, and/\nor CD204. These macrophages exert anti-inflammatory functions \nby production of IL-10 and TGF-β (12). M2 macrophages can \nalso produce matrix metalloproteinases contributing to extra \ncellular matrix turnover and fibrosis (13).\nAs different monocyte and macrophage subset phenotypes \nare functionally different in induction and/or maintenance of \ninflammation or fibrosis, it is important to investigate their role \nin relation to heart transplant rejection. This information will \neventually help identifying key cell types, molecules, and mark￾ers, which can serve as diagnostic biomarkers of rejection, and/\nor as targets for rejection treatment. Here, we aimed to define and \ncorrelate monocyte/macrophage profiles in tissue and circulation \nusing endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) obtained at rejection and \ntime points prior to rejection, and their corresponding serial \nblood samples in 25 heart transplant recipients experiencing \nacute cellular rejection. Next, we wondered whether these cellular \nshifts were associated with structural graft damage and fibrosis. \nAdditionally, blood profiles of non-rejecting heart transplant \nrecipients were compared with 33 healthy individuals using a \ncross-sectional approach.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPatient Characteristics\nTwenty-five heart transplant recipients underwent protocol \nsurveillance biopsies within the first year after transplantation \nat the Erasmus University Medical Center (Rotterdam, The \nNetherlands). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) \nwere collected serially in time: at a time point that the protocol \nbiopsy showed no rejection, and subsequently at a time point \nof biopsy-proven rejection (median time ± SEM between both \ntime points: 3 ±  1.4  weeks). Additionally, biopsies obtained at \n1-year post-rejection were used for Sirius Red staining (median \ntime ±  SEM between rejection and post-rejection time points: \n56  ±  12.5  weeks). Of note, no rejection episodes occurred \nbetween the rejection time point and 1-year post-rejection. \nHistopathological features were scored according to 2011 and \n2005 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation \nguidelines in order to diagnose acute antibody-mediated rejection \nand acute cellular rejection and to grade EMBs as non-rejection \n(0R) or rejection (2R) (14, 15).\nAll studied endomycardial biospies (n =  50) showed acute \ncellular rejection (2R according to 2005 ISHLT classification \nsystem) with no signs of histopathologic and immunopathologic \nevidence of acute antibody-mediated rejection. All biopsies were \nC4d negative. Intravascular macrophages and neutrophils as well \nas signs of endothelial injury such as swelling and denudation \nwith congestion and/or hemorrhage were absent. No serologic \nevidence of anti-HLA antibodies could be detected using \nLuminex technique.\nThis study was performed according to the tenets of the \nDeclaration of Helsinki and approved by the Medical Ethical \nCommittee of the Erasmus MC. All patients signed written \ninformed consent. Table 1 lists the transplantation characteristics \nand the clinical and immunological features of this cohort. In \naddition, blood samples were collected from 33 healthy individu￾als [age: median +  range: 51 (25–73); male: 42%] and used as \ncontrol.\nAll patients were treated with horse or rabbit antithymocyte \nglobulin (hATG or rATG) as induction therapy in combina￾tion with maintenance calcineurin inhibition (Prograft® or \nNeoral®), mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept®), and steroids; the \ndose schedule was adjusted according to the local standard \nprotocol.\nPhenotype, Activation, and Co-Stimulatory \nMolecule Status of Monocytes\nIn order to investigate monocyte phenotype, activation status, \nand co-stimulatory molecules (HLA-DR and CD54), PBMC were \n\nTable 1 | Clinical and immunological characteristics of heart transplant \nrecipients.\nCharacteristics Recipients (n = 25) \nAge [median (year), range] 46 (15–64)\nGender (% male) 64%\nPrimary disease (number of patients, %)\nCardiomyopathy 16 (64%)\nIschemic heart disease 9 (36%)\nInduction therapy\nHorse-antithymocyte globulin 68%\nRabbit-antithymocyte globulin 32%\nMaintenance therapy\nCyclosporine/prednisone/mycophenolate \nmofetil\n56%\nTacrolimus/prednisone/mycophenolate \nmofetil\n44%\nHLA mismatches total (median, range)\nClass I mismatches 3 (2–4)\nClass II mismatches 2 (1–2)\nIschemia [median (min), range] 170 (137–250)\n3\nvan den Bosch et al.

Labeling and \nflow cytometric assessment were performed as described before \n(16, 17). Monocytes were identified based on forward/sideward \nscatter, lack of expression of CD3, CD20, and CD56, and expres￾sion of CD14 and CD16 (Figure 1A).\nIntracellular Cytokine Production\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells were incubated overnight \nwith 10 ng/ml LPS (Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence of GolgiPlug \n(1:1,000, Becton Dickinson) after pre-stimulation with IFN-γ\nfor 2 h. The cells were then incubated with conjugated primary \nantibodies in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine \nserum albumine for 30 min. The antibodies used were CD3-PE, \nCD14-Pacfic Blue, CD16-PE-Cy7, CD20-PE, and CD56-PE (all \nBiolegend) at 4°C and were incubated with EDTA for 15 min \nfollowed by incubation with FACS permeabilizing solution 2 \n(BD Biosciences) for 15  min. Next, conjugated antibodies to \nTNF-α-Percp-Cy5.5, IFN-γ-APC-Cy7, IL-1β-FITC, IL-6-APC, \nand IL-10-APC and their respective isotype controls (all \nBiolegend) were added to determine intracellular cytokine \nproduction. The cells were washed and analyzed using flow \ncytometry (FACSCanto II, BD Biosciences) and FACSDiva \nsoftware (16).\nImmunohistochemical Staining\nImmunohistochemistry was performed by an automated staining \nsystem (Ventana Benchmark ULTRA, Ventana Medical Systems, \nUSA) using horseradish peroxidase with brown chromogen \n(3,3′-diaminobenzidine) as enzymatic label. Tissue sections were \nincubated with antibodies against CD14 (clone 7, mouse-mon￾oclonal IgG2a, 1:100, Leica Biosystems, Newcastle, DE, USA), \nCD16 (clone sc-20052, mouse-monoclonal IgG1, 1:400, Santa \nCruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), CD56 (clone 123C3, \nmouse-monoclonal, Ventana, ready to use, Tucson, AZ, USA), \nCD68 (clone KP1, mouse-monoclonal, ready to use, DAKO, \nCarpentaria, CA, USA), CD80 (clone 37711, mouse-monoclonal \nIgG1, 1:50, R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), or CD163 \n(clone EDHu-1, mouse-monoclonal, IgG1, 1:400, AbD Serotec, \nRaleigh, NC, USA). Two pathologists independently scored these \nEMBs.\nImmunofluorescence Staining\nTissue sections were incubated with primary mouse monoclonal \nCD14 IgG2a antibody overnight at 4°C. Secondary goat anti￾mouse IgG2a Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) was applied and \nincubated for 1  h at room temperature (RT). After washing \nsteps, the second primary antibody mouse-monoclonal CD16 \nIgG1 was added for 1 h. Next, the secondary goat-anti-mouse \nIgG1 Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen) was applied for another 1 h \nat RT. Slides were covered with anti-fading mounting medium \ncontaining DAPI (Vectashield, UK) and stored at 4°C until \nevaluation.\nTo distinguish CD16 expressing monocytes from the infiltrat￾ing CD16+ NK-cells and CD68+ macrophages, CD14/CD16, \nCD56/CD16, and CD68/CD16 double stainings were performed \nas described above. Double staining with CD68 (1:1,600, clone \nKP1, mouse-monoclonal, DAKO, Carpentaria, CA, USA) \nand CD80 (clone 37711, mouse-monoclonal IgG1, 1:50, R&D \nsystems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) were used to characterize \nM1-type macrophages. For M2 macrophages, double stainings \nwere performed with CD68 and CD163 (clone EDHu-1, mouse￾monoclonal, IgG1, 1:400, AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC, USA) \nmAbs. Specific controls are used as displayed in Figure S2 in \nSupplementary Material.\nSirius Red Staining\nIn brief, following deparaffinization slides were rehydrated by \npassage through decreasing ethanol series, 5 min predifferenta￾tion step using 0.2% fosformolybdeen acid followed by 45 min \nincubation with 0.1% Sirius Red solution. Slides were analyzed \nusing polarization method. Representative pictures were made \nunder polarized light and positive stained area was analyzed by \nthe ImageJ software.\nImage Analyses and Laser Scanning \nConfocal Microscopy\nEndomyocardial biopsy samples were scored using ImageJ IHC \nanalysis software (18). Analyses were performed blinded to the \nclinical source using scanned Nanozoomer Digital Pathology files. \nImages of the entire biopsy sample (mean size range: 3.4–3.6 mm) \nwere analyzed at 10× objective magnification.\nConfocal microscopy was performed using LSM-700 laser \nscanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). The entire biopsy \nsamples were scored counting the absolute number of cells as for \nCD16+CD56−, CD16+CD56+, CD16−CD56+, CD14+CD16−, \nCD14+CD16+, or CD14−CD16+ using 40× magnification.\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism 6. \nStatistical significance was evaluated by Mann–Whitney U test, \nt-test, and one-way ANOVA. A p-value of <0.05 was considered \nstatistically significant.\n\nFigure 1 | Continued\n4\nvan den Bosch et al.

Although the absolute numbers of monocytes were \nsimilar, the percentages of classical CD14++CD16− monocytes \n[NR: 92% ± 7.5, R: 90% ± 4.5 (median ± IQR)] were significantly \nhigher (p < 0.05, p < 0.001), and the percentages of intermediate \nCD14++CD16+ [NR:4% ±  1.5, R:4% ±  3.5 (median ±  IQR)] \nand non-classical CD14+CD16++ monocytes [NR:3%  ±  3.5, \nR:3% ±  3.5 (median ±  IQR)] were significantly lower in heart \ntransplant recipients than healthy controls [83%  ±  5.25, \n5.5% ± 3.5, 9% ± 4.75 (median ± IQR)] (p < 0.001) (Figures 1B–\nD). Moreover, no subset differences could be detected between \nnon-rejection and rejection time points.\nCirculating CD3+ T  cell frequencies were significantly \nincreased during rejection as compared with non-rejection time \npoints which is consistent with previous findings (19) (p < 0.001) \n(Figure S1 in Supplementary Material).\nCD16+ Monocytes Are Significantly \nIncreased in Rejecting EMBs\nSerial EMBs were stained using double immunofluorescence \nlabeling with CD14 and CD16. Co-localization and mem￾branous staining of CD14 and CD16 is shown in rejected \ntissue (Figure  1H). Absolute numbers of stained cells were \ncounted using 20× magnification field by confocal microscopy. \nConsidering the fact that mean surface area of the total biopsies \nranged between 3.4–3.6 mm2\n, there was no need to correct the \ndata for the size of biopsies. Absolute numbers of CD14+CD16−\nmonocytes were significantly higher during rejection com￾pared to non-rejection biopsies (p <  0.05). Although usually \nminor subsets in peripheral blood, both CD14+CD16+ and \nCD14−CD16+ subsets were prominantly increased during \nrejection in tissue compared to the prior non-rejection time \npoint (p < 0.001, Figures 1E–G).\nTo verify whether CD16+ cells were either CD14+\nmonocyte or CD56+ NK-cell or CD68+ macrophage, double \nimmunofluorescence stainings were performed using CD16/\nCD56, CD14/CD68, and CD16/CD68 labeling (Figures 2G–I). \nIndividual biopsy analyses showed hardly any co-localization \nbetween CD56 and CD16 staining (Figure 2G). Intra-individual \nanalysis of the monocyte subsets showed high numbers of \nCD16+ expressing cells at rejection (Figures 2A–C). Although \nthe simultaneously present CD56+ NK cells were very low in \nabsolute numbers at rejection compared to non-rejection time \npoints, this difference appeared to be statistically significant \nbetween these two time points (Figure 2D). The absolute num￾bers of infiltrating CD56−CD16+ cells were significantly higher \ncompared to CD56+CD16− within rejecting tissue (p < 0.001, \nFigures 2D–F). Similarly, representative confocal images could \nhardly show co-localization between CD14- and CD16-positive \ncells with CD68 surface-expression using CD14/CD68 and \nCD16/CD68 double stainings of all biopsies (Figures  2H–I). \nBased on these data, the CD14−CD16+ tissue pool can be \nconsidered as monocytes.\nRejection Is Reflected by Increased \nExpression of HLA-DR and CD54 by \nCD16+ Peripheral Blood Monocytes\nTo compare monocyte subsets at functional level, expression of \nco-stimulatory and migration-related molecules by CD16− and \nCD16+ blood monocyte populations were studied in 10 patients at \nnon-rejection and rejection time points. The HLA-DR expression \nlevel was significantly increased on CD16+ monocytes compared \nwith CD16− monocytes at both non-rejection and rejection time \npoints (Figure  3A). During rejection, HLA-DR expression by \nCD16+ monocytes was even significantly higher as compared \nto non-rejection time point before. CD16+ monocytes express \nCD54 at a higher degree compared to CD16− monocytes and \nthis CD54 expression was, although statistically not significant, \nenhanced during rejection (Figure 3B).\nPro-inflammatory Cytokine Production \nPotential of Monocytes in Heart Transplant \nRecipients Is Preserved and Independent \nof Rejection Status\nTo explore the cytokine production capacity of monocytes in 10 \nheart transplant recipients, we preferred to investigate production \nof pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ\nand anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 by in  vitro experiments \nafter LPS stimulation and compared this with healthy individuals \n(Figure  3C) because localizing cytokine expression on tissue \nlevel is generally considered to be associated with a high rate of \nfalse positive and false-negative results. The percentage of IFN-γ￾producing cells was higher in healthy individuals compared with \nheart transplant recipients (p: 0.112), whereas the production \n\nFigure 2 | CD16+ cells in graft tissue are monocytes and accumulate upon rejection. The expression of CD14 and CD16 was analyzed in biopsies at two \ntime points; non-rejection (NR; n = 25) and rejection (R; n = 25) and compared intra-individually. The absolute number of cells is depicted for (A) CD14+CD16−, \n(B) CD14+CD16+, and (C) CD14−CD16+. The expression of (D) CD56 was measured using immunohistochemistry, analyzed by ImageJ and depicted as mean \n% positive stained area. The absolute numbers of cells of (E,F) CD56+CD16− and CD56+16+ were determined.

These findings \nindicate that, despite the use of potent immunosuppressive drugs \nin heart transplant recipients, monocytes still remain capable of \ncytokine production, oftentimes at a similar level as in healthy \nindividuals.\nM2 Macrophages Increase in Rejecting \nEndomyocardial Tissue Compared to \nNon-Rejection Time Point\nTo explore the type of tissue-infiltrating macrophages, CD68, \nCD80, and CD163 expression was tested using immunohisto￾chemistry and quantified using ImageJ analysis. A significantly \nincreased presence of CD68+ macrophages was detected in \nrejected tissue compared to non-rejected tissue in both grouped \nand intra-individual analysis (p < 0.001, Figures 4A,D,G,H). To \ninvestigate whether these macrophages are of M1 or M2 origin, \nadjacent immunohistochemical and double immunofluores￾cence staining were performed using CD68+CD80 (M1) and \nCD68+CD163 (M2) combinations. Confocal microscopy was \nused to show co-localization (Figure  4K). CD80 was hardly \nexpressed by CD68+ macrophages in the endomyocardial tissue \n(Figures 4B,E,I). Expression increased, albeit not significantly, \nwith rejection, but levels of CD80-expressing cells remained \nlow. In contrast, the vast majority of CD68+ macrophages co￾expressed CD163 in biopsies of both rejecting and non-rejecting \ntissue (Figures  4C,F,J,K) showing a significant increase upon \nrejection.\nSevere Persistent Fibrosis at Rejection \nWhich Is Irreversible over Time\nTo investigate the association between the detected cellular shifts \nand the degree of fibrosis, the positive Sirius Red stained area at \nnon-rejection, rejection, and approximately 1-year post-rejection \nwas measured. A significantly increased degree of fibrosis was \nfound at rejection compared to non-rejection time point persist￾ing at 1-year post-rejection (p < 0.001: Figure 5B). Fibrosis was \nmainly localized in interstitium and the perivascular areas show￾ing focal collagen accumulation (Figure 5A).\nDISCUSSION\nHere, we present an in-depth analysis of peripheral blood and \ntissue monocyte/macrophage profiles of 25 heart transplant \nrecipients experiencing acute cellular rejection. We found \ncontrasting monocyte subset profile in blood and tissue during \nrejection with prominent presence of CD16+ monocytes and M2 \nmacrophages at the tissue level. Increased classical monocytes and \n\nFigure 4 | M2-type macrophages predominate in transplanted endomyocardial tissue and increase upon rejection. The expression of (A) CD68, \n(B) CD80, and (C) CD163 was measured using immunohistochemistry, analyzed by ImageJ and depicted as mean % positive stained area. The expression of \n(D) CD68, (E) CD80, and (F) CD163 was analyzed intra-individually at rejection and non-rejection time points.

Monocytes in Heart Transplant Rejection\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org March 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 346\nsimultaneously decreased fractions of CD16+ monocytes signify \nthe monocyte subset composition in heart transplant recipients \ncompared to healthy individuals. No numerical differences were \nnoted between rejection and non-rejection conditions. However, \nrejection was reflected by a significantly increased expression of \nHLA-DR and CD54 within the circulating CD16+ monocyte \npool pointing toward a higher activation grade, antigen presenta￾tion potential, and increased migratory capacity of the activated \nmonocytes toward the graft. In line, at tissue level, significantly \nmore CD16+ monocytes, especially of CD14-negative phenotype \nwere detected. Also, significantly more CD68+CD163+ M2 \nmacrophages were documented during rejection. CD68+CD80+\nM1 subtype remained a minute subset. The finding of signifi￾cantly increased fibrosis at rejection, which was also persistently \ndetectable in 1-year biopsies together with the accumulation of \nCD16+ monocytes and M2 macrophages, indicates an associa￾tion between these cellular shifts in induction of the prolonged \ndamage to the heart transplant tissue.\nOn tissue level, we detected significantly higher frequencies \nof CD16+ monocytes in the rejecting heart tissue. We showed \nthat CD16+ tissue-infiltrating cells are monocytes as hardly \nco-localization with CD68 and CD56 could be detected ruling \n\nFigure 6 | A model for contrasting findings between blood and tissue monocyte–macrophage lineage cells during heart transplant rejection. The \nputative scenario of events based on our findings is described in Section “Discussion.” Briefly, step 1: subendothelial migration of monocytes, step 2: migration of \npro-inflammatory CD16+ monocytes toward the tissue, and step 3: macrophage polarization in to high numbers of anti-inflammatory M2-macropghages \ncontributing to remodeling and fibrosis of the damaged heart.\n10\nvan den Bosch et al. Monocytes in Heart Transplant Rejection\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org March 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 346\nout macrophage or NK cell phenotype as the cell source. M2 \nmacrophages accumulate increasingly in tissue during rejec￾tion suggesting that the presence of CD16+ monocytes, with \na presumed pro-inflammatory nature, and anti-inflammatory \nIL-10-producing M2 macrophages are parts of a micro-envi￾ronmental balance within the endomyocardial tissue. Higher \ntissue macrophage frequencies are known to predict worse graft \noutcome (20). Future research is needed to investigate mono￾cyte–macrophage profiles during acute antibody-mediated \nrejection.\nIn Figure  6, we attempt to visualize a model based on our \ndata. It is tempting to think that preferentially CD16+ mono￾cytes will leave circulation and enter the graft at transplantation, \ncausing vasculopathy in due time (21). Rejection results in an \neven higher influx of activated CD16+ monocytes producing \npro-inflammatory cytokines. At the same time, a counterbal￾anced predominance of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages \ncontributes to the remodeling and fibrosis of the damaged heart \ntissue (22).\nIn conclusion, although the numbers of included patients \nin this explorative study are limited, fibrosis is investigated \nby Serius Red stainings and not by cardiac MRI with delayed \ngadolinium pre- and post-rejection, to our knowledge, this is \nthe first report on matched serial blood samples and EMBs at \ntime points prior to rejection and at rejection. Here, we showed \nthat CD16+ monocytes and M2 macrophages hallmark the \ncorrelates of acute cellular rejection on tissue level and seem \nto be associated with fibrosis after heart transplant rejection in \nthe long term. The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms \nunderlying these cellular shifts may lead to discovery of new \nmolecular biomarkers indicating the immunological graft \nstatus and may help finding new molecular targets for specific \nimmunotherapy.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nTB contributed in the process of writing, experimenting, design, \ndiscussing, and data analyses.

The study involved analyzing the expression of specific markers on monocytes and macrophages in endomyocardial biopsies from heart transplant recipients. The results showed that there was a significant increase in CD16+CD56- macrophages during periods of rejection, indicating their involvement in the rejection process. Furthermore, the study revealed that macrophages infiltrated the heart allograft before rejection, suggesting a possible role in preventing rejection. The findings suggest that targeting these macrophage subsets may offer new therapeutic opportunities for managing heart transplant rejection. The study highlights the importance of understanding the roles of different macrophage subsets in allograft rejection and provides insights into potential future treatments for heart transplant rejection.

Infections remain common and serious complications.\nMethods: 217 consecutive enteric drained PTxs performed from 1997 to 2004 were\nretrospectively analyzed with regard to bloodstream infection. Immunosuppression consisted of\nantithymocyteglobuline induction, tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid and steroids for the majority of\ncases. Standard perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis consisted of pipercillin/tazobactam in\ncombination with ciprofloxacin and fluconazole.\nResults: One year patient, pancreas and kidney graft survival were 96.4%, 88.5% and 94.8%,\nsurgical complication rate was 35%, rejection rate 30% and rate of infection 59%. In total 46 sepsis\nepisodes were diagnosed in 35 patients (16%) with a median onset on day 12 (range 1–45) post\ntransplant. Sepsis source was intraabdominal infection (IAI) (n = 21), a contaminated central venous\nline (n = 10), wound infection (n = 5), urinary tract infection (n = 2) and graft transmitted (n = 2).\nNine patients (4%) experienced multiple episodes of sepsis. Overall 65 pathogens (IAI sepsis 39,\nline sepsis 15, others 11) were isolated from blood. Gram positive cocci accounted for 50 isolates\n(77%): Coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 28, i.e. 43%) (nine multi-resistant), Staphylococcus\naureus (n = 11, i.e. 17%) (four multi-resistant), enterococci (n = 9, i.e. 14%) (one E. faecium). Gram\nnegative rods were cultured in twelve cases (18%). Patients with blood borne infection had a two\nyear pancreas graft survival of 76.5% versus 89.4% for those without sepsis (p = 0.036), patient\nsurvival was not affected.\nConclusion: Sepsis remains a serious complication after PTx with significantly reduced pancreas\ngraft, but not patient survival. The most common source is IAI.\nPublished: 08 August 2006\nBMC Infectious Diseases 2006, 6:127 doi:10.1186/1471-2334-6-127\nReceived: 08 September 2005\nAccepted: 08 August 2006\nThis article is available from: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/6/127\n© 2006 Berger et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n\nBMC Infectious Diseases 2006, 6:127 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/6/127\nPage 2 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBackground\nSimultaneous pancreas kidney transplantation (SPK) has\nevolved as an effective treatment modality for patients\nwith end stage diabetic nephropathy with excellent\npatient, pancreas and kidney graft survival [1]. This\nimproved outcome has mainly been achieved by a reduc￾tion in technical failures and more powerful immunosup￾pression with agents such as Tacrolimus, Sirolimus and\nmycophenolic acid (MMF) [2-5]. However, these more\npowerful new immunosuppressive protocols may lead to\nan increase in infectious complications [6,7]. Intraab￾dominal infection (IAI) has been shown to be frequently\nassociated with blood stream infection and IAI with sepsis\nfrequently leads to graft loss [6]. Blood stream infections\n(BSI) seem to influence both graft and patient survival\n[8,9]. Systemic infections may originate from intraab￾dominal, renal or pulmonary origin or contaminated\nintravenous lines [10]. The spectrum of pathogens iso￾lated from blood culture or from catheter tips differs\nbetween line sepsis and sepsis from other sources [11].\nCoagulase negative staphylococci seem to be the predom￾inant organisms causing line sepsis, whereas the spectrum\nof sepsis deriving from other sources is much more diverse\n[12]. Long term vascular access devices such as dialysis\ncatheters have a particular high risk to become contami￾nated [13]. The diagnosis of sepsis post transplant may be\ndifficult, because immunosuppressive agents influence\nparameters, which are indicative for inflammation such as\nthe levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and the white blood\ncount (WBC) and moreover, these parameters can be ele￾vated during graft rejection [14]. Furthermore, during the\nearly post transplant period fever can be caused by a mul￾titude of events and due to the application of steroids\npatients will not develop pyrexia, even in the case of\nproven infection. Therefore, a positive blood culture must\nbe considered a serious event and prompt further investi￾gations even if patients do not present with any clinical\nsigns of infection. It seems to be justified to monitor tips\nof indwelling devices in order to diagnose infection at the\nearliest possible time point.\nThe more physiologic enteric exocrine drainage (ED) for\npancreas transplantation is now widely accepted, but it is\nassociated with a higher risk for intraabdominal infec￾tions and subsequent sepsis as compared to bladder\ndrainage [15,16]. Due to the underlying disease, the nec￾essary central venous access and the high prevalence of\nIAI, pancreatic recipients are at high risk to develop sys￾temic infections. Data on sepsis in pancreatic recipients\nare scarce, in particular with regard to cohorts receiving\nmore powerful immunosuppression, patients with\nadvanced age or those suffering from type II diabetes mel￾litus, and when using grafts from extended criteria donors.\nAlso it is not clearly defined, if retransplantation is associ￾ated with a higher risk for sepsis.\nIn this study of 217 consecutive enteric/systemic drained\npancreas transplants all cases of bloodstream infections\nwere retrospectively analyzed. Risk factors for the develop￾ment of sepsis were investigated and the impact of sepsis\non patient, renal and pancreas graft survival with regard to\nthe different sources was determined.\nMethods\nThis is a consecutive cohort study including all patients\nwho underwent pancreas transplantation at a single center\nduring a seven year period.\nDonor and recipient demographics\nBetween March 1997 and October 2004, 217 consecutive\npatients (m/f = 133/84) with a median age of 41.9 years\n(range 22.4–62.5) underwent pancreas transplantation at\nour center: 89% together with a kidney from the same\ndonor, which was placed retroperitoneally in the left iliac\nfossa (SPK). Twenty patients received a pancreas graft\nsometime after kidney transplantation (PAK), and three\npatients a pancreas transplant alone (PTA). In 24\ninstances the pancreas (three times as SPK and 21 times\nafter a previous kidney or kidney/pancreas transplant)\nand in three cases the kidney were retransplants. Fourteen\npatients suffered from type II diabetes mellitus. Mean\ndonor age was 29 years (range 10–54). Mean cold\nischemia time for the kidney transplants was 11.7 ± 3.3\nhrs, and for the pancreas transplants 13.1 ± 3.2 hrs. All\npancreatic grafts were revascularized in an end-to-side\nfashion with the inferior vena cava and via a donor iliac Y￾graft with the right common iliac artery. Exocrine drainage\nwas completed as S/S duodeno-jejunostomy except for\ntwo duodenocystostomies, in the last 153 instances using\na stapling device [3].\nImmunosuppression\n213 patients received a single shot antithymocyteglob￾uline (ATG) (Thymoglobulin, Sangstat or ATG Fresenius)\nat begin of surgery or a three days course at a lower dosage.\nOne patient did not receive antibody induction during\npancreas retransplantation, and three patients received\nbasiliximab (Simulect ®, Novartis, Switzerland) or daclizu￾mab (Zenapax ® Roche, Switzerland). MMF (Roche, Swit￾zerland) was given at a dose of 1 g twice daily orally. A\nrapid steroid tapering regimen was applied starting with\n500 mg Methylprednisolon intraoperatively to reach a\ndose of 25 mg at the end of the first p.o. week and further\nreduction to a maintenance daily dose of 5 mg. 198\npatients received oral Tacrolimus (Tac, Fujisawa, Munich,\nGermany) at 0.08 mg/kg/day twice daily, starting six\nhours after revascularization. The Tac dose was adjusted to\nachieve whole blood trough levels of 10–12 ng/ml for the\nfirst three months after transplantation, 8–10 ng/ml for\n6–12 months and 6–8 ng/ml thereafter. A total of 11\npatients were given Cyclosporin A (CsA, Novartis, Basle,\n\nBMC Infectious Diseases 2006, 6:127 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/6/127\nPage 3 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nSwitzerland) instead of Tac (targeted trough levels of 200–\n250 ng/dl) and another 19 received Sirolimus (Whyeth,\nUSA) with targeted trough levels of 6–10 ng/ml in combi￾nation with Tac as initial immunosuppression. Four\npatients were switched from Tac to CsA and another four\nfrom CsA to Tac. CsA was only used during the early study\nperiod (1997–1998) as part of the EURO SPK I trial and\nSirolimus was introduced 2002 as part of the EURO SPK\nII trial.\nPerioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis\nA total of 30 patients transplanted between 1997 and\n1998 received Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid 3 × 2, 2 g and\n157 patients transplanted between 1998 and 2004\nreceived Piperacillin/Tazobactam 3 × 4, 5 g for 48–72\nhours as perioperative systemic antimicrobial prophylaxis\nand 30 patients received other antimicrobials in case of\nPenicillin allergy. Quinolones were added as prophylactic\nagents in the last 106 cases. A total of 168 patients in addi￾tion received Fluconazol (400 mg daily) for seven days.\nProphylaxis for CMV infection was used in 31 CMV seron￾egative patients receiving a CMV positive graft (Ganciclo￾vir 2 × 5 mg/kg/day for 10 days, followed by 3000 mg\norally for 2 months or recently Valganciclovir 2 × 450\nmg). All other patients were monitored on a weekly basis\nand treated preemptively if tested positive for CMV repli￾cation.\nBacterial/fungal monitoring\nImmediately before transplantation a sample of preserva￾tion solution and parts of the donor ureter, ascites and\nurine from the recipient were taken. Post-transplant tips\nof removed urinary as well as intravascular catheters as\nwell as tips of all intraabdominal drains were sent for\nmicrobiological investigation. During ICU stay fluids\nfrom thoracic or intraabdominal drains and tracheal or\nbronchial secretions were taken every day. Sputa, tracheal\naspirations, bronchoalveolar lavages, aspiration fluids,\nwound swabs, cerebrospinal fluid, blood and biopsies\nwere sent whenever indicated. Blood cultures were taken\nin cases of fever (higher 38 centigrade): two to four con￾secutive samples within four hours. These samples were\ncultured aerobically as well as anaerobically for seven days\nbefore being reported out negative.\nDefinition of sepsis\nBacterial/fungal infection was assumed when a positive\nculture and clinical signs and/or laboratory parameters\nrequiring antibiotic treatment. Positive surveillance cul￾tures without clinical symptoms were considered coloni￾zation. In all cases of sepsis in this series a causing\norganism could be cultured from blood or a catheter tip or\nboth. Positive blood culture or isolation of an organism\nfrom blood without clinical symptoms or laboratory\nabnormalities were not considered sepsis but prompted\nfurther investigations. Clinical signs included fever higher\n38 centigrade; laboratory indicators were leucocytosis (>\n10000 WBC) or leucopenia (< 3000 WBC) and elevated\nC-reactive protein (CRP). For coagulase negative staphylo￾cocci, sepsis was only considered if two isolates from\nblood cultures or one positive blood culture with a second\nisolate from a contaminated line or other source of sepsis\nwere present.\nViral monitoring\nThe donor CMV status was recorded from the report of the\ndonor center and for the recipient on pretransplant serol￾ogy (anti CMV IgG and IgM antibodies). All patients\nunderwent weekly testing for Cytomegalovirus (CMV)\nantigen (phosphoprotein 65: pp65) or the Digene DNA\nCMV hybrid capture assay. In 2003 CMV PCR (Roche ®\nAmplicor, Switzerland) was introduced into clinical prac￾tice.\nData collection and statistical analysis\nA database was created using Microsoft excel 5.0. For each\npatient an individual datasheet was completed, which\ncontained daily body temperature, laboratory results,\nimmunosuppressive and antimicrobial therapy as well as\nall results from microbiological investigations. Baseline\ndata were prospectively collected and supplemented by\nretrospectively collected data such as complications, graft\nloss and death. Statistical analysis was carried out using\nMS excel and SPSS including Chi-square test and non par￾ametric Mann-Whitney-U or Kruskal-Wallis assay. Data\nare reported as median with minimum/maximum range,\nmean ± SD. Survival was calculated using the Kaplan￾Meier method. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statisti￾cally significant.\nResults\nPatient and graft survival\nThe median follow up was 3.2 years (range: 0.1–7.8).\nOverall one- and three-year actuarial patient survival was\n96.4% and 94%, respectively. From the 14 deaths, which\noccurred median 15 months (range 1–74) post trans￾plant, ten occurred with functioning grafts and the\nremaining four patients lost the pancreatic or renal graft\nfunction prior to death. The causes of death were myocar￾dial infarction in five cases, haemorrhage and cerebrovas￾cular insult in one patient each, de novo malignancies in\nanother two patients and infection in the remaining five\ncases including one pneumonia, one viral infection\n(HHV6, CMV) and three filamentous fungal infections.\nNo patient died directly related to a blood borne infec￾tion.\nKidney one- and three-year survival was calculated to be\n94.8% and 93.2%. Seventeen renal grafts (7.7%) were lost\nafter three years. One kidney was lost due to early arterial\n\nBMC Infectious Diseases 2006, 6:127 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/6/127\nPage 4 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nthrombosis and another due to Polyomavirus-infection.\nTwo patients lost their renal grafts due to chronic dysfunc￾tion, in one case associated with drug toxicity and in the\nother this was due to non compliance. One patient devel￾oped infective endocarditis of the tricuspid valve and\ndeveloped septic arterial graft thrombosis leading to renal\ngraft loss. The patient underwent valve repair but died\nlater on from invasive zygomycosis. The remaining losses\nwere death with functioning graft (DWFG).\nOverall one- and three-year pancreas graft survival was\n88.5% and 83.8%. Of the 217 pancreas grafts, 182 (84%)\nare currently functioning without exogenous insulin and\nnormal HbA1c levels at a median follow up of 3.2 (range\n0.1–7.8) years. Causes of the 35 pancreas graft losses were\nirreversible rejection/dysfunction (n = 9), intraabdominal\ninfection (n = 5), arterial thrombosis/infarction (n = 9),\narterial bleeding (n = 2), and death with functioning graft\n(n = 11). Therefore, technical failure (16 grafts) was the\nmost common cause of graft loss with thrombosis\naccounting for the majority of cases.\nPost operative course\nDuring first hospitalization, a total of 75 rejection epi￾sodes in 65 patients (30%) were treated. In 60 instances\nout of 217 transplants (27%) one or more relaparotomies\nfor surgical complications were necessary within the first\npost operative (p.o.) year. During the p.o. stay patients\ndeveloped sub febrile temperatures on 33% and fever over\n38 centigrade on 9% of observation days.\nInfectious complications\nWithin the first three months a total of 208 infectious epi￾sodes following 119 transplants were recorded. Another\n48 infectious episodes were diagnosed during further fol￾low up. The spectrum of infectious complications is\nshown in table 2, recurrent infections of the same type\nwere not counted separately. Sepsis was the third most\ncommon infectious complication in this series. Only IAI\n(56 episodes in 47 patients) were diagnosed more fre￾quently and CMV infection and disease (in total 53\npatients, six with recurrent episodes). The incidence of the\nlatter significantly declined after change from a preemp￾tive strategy to Ganciclovir prophylaxis for high risk\npatients.\nMonitoring of catheters\nIn total 322 tips of central venous catheters were sent for\nmicrobiological investigation. Of those 221 (69%) were\nsterile. There were 19 mixed infections. In total 121 path￾ogens were cultivated including 103 gram positive cocci,\n14 gram negative rods and four non fermentative bacilli.\nFigure 1a shows the spectrum of pathogens. Large diame￾ter catheters (n = 27) were independently analyzed. None\nof the nine pulmonary arterial catheters (Swan Ganz) was\ncontaminated, whereas six of nine large pore catheters\n(multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus 2, coagulase nega￾tive Staphylococci 2, multiresistant coagulase negative\nStaphylococci 1 and multiresistant coagulase negative Sta￾phylococci/Serratia spp. 1) and four of nine Quinton\ncatheters (coagulase negative Staphylococci 3, Enterococ￾cus fecalis 1) were contaminated.\nResults from blood cultures\nA total of 338 blood cultures were analyzed (multiple\nblood cultures taken in the same patient on the same day\nwas considered one event) and 66 pathogens were iso￾lated including 49 Gram positive cocci, ten Gram negative\nrods and Propionibacterium acnes and Candida albicans\nin one case each. There were six blood cultures that grew\nmultiple organisms. When looking at the total number of\nblood cultures (n = 439), 379 were sterile and 60 (14%)\nshowed growth of pathogens.

Nine patients experienced multiple sepsis epi￾sodes with four patients having both IAI with sepsis and\nline sepsis. In 60% (21 patients) the source of sepsis was\nIAI, in ten cases the source was a contaminated line and in\neight cases other sources were identified. The median\nonset of sepsis associated with IAI was on day 12 (range\n6–45), for line sepsis it was day 12 (range 6–32) and for\nother causes of septic episodes it was on day 13 (range 1–\n24) post transplant. The sepsis source in the latter cases\nwere urinary tract (n = 2), graft transmitted (n = 2) and\nwound infection (n = 5). In total 65 pathogens (IAI sepsis\n39, line sepsis 15, others 11) were isolated from blood.\nTable 3 shows demographic data and the spectrum of\norganisms according to the source of sepsis. Gram positive\ncocci accounted for the vast majority of pathogens causing\nsepsis (50 of the 65 isolates, i.e. 75%). The most com￾monly isolated single pathogens were coagulase negative\nstaphylococci with 28 isolates of which nine were multire￾sistant, Staphylococcus aureus accounted for eleven cases\n(four MRSA) and enterococci for nine cases (one E. fae￾cium). Gram negative rods were cultured in twelve cases.\nThe most common cause of sepsis originating from IAI\nwas graft pancreatitis with 10 cases, followed by peritoni￾tis in five cases and infected ascites in two cases. In one\ncase each an infected peripancreatic seroma, an intraab￾dominal hematoma, graft necrosis due to portal vein\nthrombosis and a leak at the distal stapler line of the duo￾denal segment were the source of sepsis. The spectrum of\npathogens changed during the study period with intensi￾fied perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. Whereas for the\nfirst 112 cases polymicrobial infection including Gram\nnegative rods and Gram positive cocci was present in eight\nof 12 cases, during the last 105 cases six of nine sepsis\ncases originating from IAI were monomicrobial with CNS\naccounting for four episodes. This includes also the\npatient with the duodenal leak. In terms of management\nof IAI, 18 of the 21 patients with IAI underwent relaparot￾omie; the remaining three percutaneous drainage. In\naddition to the above mentioned intraabdominal pathol￾ogy, intraoperative findings were infected hematoma (n =\n6), which were associated with pancreatitis in four cases\nand a thrombosed graft in one case, wound infection (n =\n12), and wound dehiscence (n = 3). During these 18 inter￾ventions four grafts had to be removed.\nA significant reduction in the rejection rate was observed\nduring the study period from 41% for the first 112 cases\nto 18% for the following 105 cases. Concomitantly the\nrate of blood stream infection rose from 13% to 19%. The\ndifference did not reach statistic significance.\nOut of the 35 patients with sepsis 33 (94.3%) developed\nalso other infectious complications, whereas 52.7% of the\n182 patients who had no sepsis had other infections (p <\n0.0001). A total of 15 patients had sepsis and CMV infec￾tion/disease. In eleven of the 15 cases, sepsis onset pro￾ceeded CMV infection/disease, with a median interval of\n20 (range 2–109) days. Ganciclovir prophylaxis for all\nCMV mismatched transplants in the last 105 cases had a\nmajor impact on the incidence of CMV infection/disease.\nWhereas 12 of 15 patients who developed sepsis during\nthe early period (first 112 cases) also had CMV infection/\ndisease, only three of 20 patients of the later cohort devel￾oped sepsis and CMV infection/disease.\nTable 1 shows demographic and clinical data for patients\nwith and without sepsis. Donor age (35 versus 28 years)\nand Type II diabetes mellitus (17.1% versus 4.4%) were\nfound to be significant risk factors for the development of\nsepsis, whereas recipient age, rejection rate and ischemic\ntime had no impact.

In our series 35 patients\n(16%) developed systemic infection. Sepsis was the third\nmost common infection in this series. Most commonly\nthe source was IAI, however, in eleven cases the source was\na contaminated central venous line. Rare sources were uri￾nary tract infection and wound infection. Of note, in two\ncases a contaminated graft resulted in systemic infection.\nThe most common single pathogen was Staphylococcus\nepidermidis. We were able to identify advanced donor\nand recipient age and type II diabetes mellitus to be risk\nfactors for the development of sepsis. Blood stream infec￾tion had a significant impact on pancreatic and renal graft\nsurvival.\nPancreas transplantation has become widely accepted as\ntherapy for patients with end stage diabetic nephropathy\n[2]. According to the International Pancreas Transplant\nRegistry report, the technical failure rates exceed the\nimmunological failure rates [1]. In our series of 217 con￾secutive enteric drained pancreas transplants using ATG\ninduction, Tacrolimus, MMF and steroids prophylactic\nimmunosuppression one – year patient, pancreas and kid￾ney graft survival was 94%, 83% and 90%. Overall, 30%\nof patients had to be treated for rejection. The rejection\nrate in this series declined from 41% in earlier cases to\n18%, but at the same time the incidence of sepsis\nincreased from 13% to 19%. For the usage of Sirolimus no\nincreased infection rate or sepsis rate could be observed,\nhowever, the number of patients receiving this new agent\nin this series is too small to draw final conclusions.\nInfection remains a common complication following\nsolid organ transplantation [5,15,17]. Although many of\nthese infections are well controllable due to rapid detec￾tion and highly active antimicrobial agents, some of them\nremain a significant threat for the patient. In pancreas\nrecipients postoperative infections are reported to occur in\n50–100% [7,10,18-21]. Bacterial infections, especially\nsystemic infection, remain a significant source of morbid￾ity and mortality during the early postoperative period\n[6,8]. In our series the overall infection rate was 59% with\nsepsis being the third most common infection. Similar to\npreviously published data, sepsis originating from IAI was\nassociated with significantly increased hospitalization\nand costs and a poorer graft survival [22-25]. The most\ncommon source of systemic infections in our series was\nintraabdominal infection. In total 45 out of the 217\npatients (20.7%) developed IAI and of 138 organisms\nwere cultured including Gram positive cocci (n = 69),\nGram positive rods (n = 6), Gram negative rods (n = 35),\nnon fermentative bacilli (n = 13), anaerobes (n = 7), fungi\n(n = 8). Most commonly IAI was associated with pancrea￾titis. Only one case, which led to sepsis, was associated\nwith an anastomotic leakage. Ten of 15 patients trans￾planted during the early period had multiple episodes of\nsepsis. Of these, nine were associated with ongoing IAI.\nDuring the later period only six of 20 patients had multi￾ple episodes of sepsis. This included four patients with\nongoing IAI. In the cases of ongoing IAI causing sepsis\nantibiotic therapy had to be adapted several times due to\na shift in the spectrum of isolated pathogens. Severe early\npost-transplant IAI was a significant risk factor for graft\nloss. Line sepsis was the second most common systemic\ninfection whereas other sources for sepsis are rare. Nota￾bly, five cases derived from wound infection. Wound\ninfection in pancreas recipients with long standing diabe￾tes and angiopathy who receive steroids has a tendency of\ndelayed healing. This might explain the high frequency of\nwound infections that spread to the bloodstream. If the\nnew immunosuppressive agents Sirolimus or Everolimus\nare added even slower healing may be expected [26,27].\nCoagulase negative staphylococci were the predominant\npathogens causing sepsis in our series regardless of the ori￾gin. One third of these isolates were multiresistant, and\nout of nine isolates of Staphylococcus aureus four were\nmultiresistant. Nevertheless, this fact does not justify to\nadd a glycopeptide to the prophylactic regimen. However,\nif sepsis is suspected, a glycopeptide should be included in\nthe empiric therapy until blood cultures are reported. No\ncase of candidemia was observed; however, in eight cases\nof IAI, candida was isolated from the abdominal cavity.\nNotably for the last 168 cases fluconazole prophylaxis was\nGraft survival according to th infection Figure 2 e development of boodstream \nGraft survival according to the development of boodstream \ninfection.\nGaft survival (years)\n0 2 4 6 8\n% Grafts\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\np=0.036\nPatients without\nSepsis (n=182)\nPatients with\nSepsis (n=35)\n\nBMC Infectious Diseases 2006, 6:127 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/6/127\nPage 8 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nused. Per protocol in the case of IAI we include an antifun￾gal agent in the empiric antimicrobial regimen. After a\nfirst case of Candida krusei IAI we use Caspofungin (70\nmg starting dose followed by 50 daily) in these cases. The\nempiric antibacterial combination for IAI consists prefer￾ably of a Glycopeptide in combination with a Carbap￾enem. For prevention of line sepsis, intravascular\ncatheters are removed at the earliest possible time point.\nThis may be particularly important for large diameter cen￾tral venous lines. For prevention of sepsis associated with\nurinary tract infection, early removal of the catheter was\nperformed. In our series only two cases of sepsis associ￾ated with UTI were diagnosed. The incidence of urinary\ntract infection in our series was 10% with only 4% during\nthe early period, however 17% during the later period.\nPossibly, the intensified immunosuppression and chang￾ing patient demographics such as increased recipient age\nand transplantation of patients suffering from type II DM\ncould explain this recent increased frequency.\nIn summary, combined pancreas-kidney transplantation\nwith systemic venous/enteric exocrine drainage under\nTacrolimus/MMF immunosuppression using a short\ncourse of high dose ATG induction results in a low rate of\nimmunological graft losses (2.1%/yr at our institution).\nHowever, there remains considerable surgical morbidity\nwith a 6.5% technical failure rate within the first post\noperative year. Infection remains the most common com￾plication and the most common cause of graft loss and\ndeath. Prevention of systemic infections targets for pre￾vention of IAI as first step as IAI is the most common\nsource. Sterile handling of central venous lines and\nremoval at the earliest possible time point are further\nsteps. Importantly, two cases in this series derived from\nurinary tract infection and another two cases were trans￾mitted by the graft. Further improvements in pancreas\npreservation, improvement in infection prophylaxis and\nbetter control of intraabdominal infectious complications\nwill be needed to reduce the incidence of bloodstream\ninfections and further improve results following pancreas\ntransplantation [6,28,29].\nReferences\n1.

The study found that macrovascular complications developed in 18.1% of patients, with a higher incidence observed in males and in those with a history of diabetes mellitus or hypertension. Small vessel diseases, including non-atherosclerotic lesions and glomerulosclerosis, were also identified in 22.2% of patients, with no significant difference based on gender or diabetes mellitus status. The study suggests that macrovascular complications and small vessel diseases may contribute to long-term morbidity and mortality in SPK recipients, highlighting the need for continued surveillance and management strategies. Additionally, the study notes that the incidence of macrovascular complications and small vessel diseases appears comparable to that seen in the general population, suggesting that traditional cardiovascular risk factors may play a role in their development in this patient population. The authors recommend ongoing evaluation of cardiovascular risk factors and implementation of appropriate prevention and management strategies in SPK recipients."}
