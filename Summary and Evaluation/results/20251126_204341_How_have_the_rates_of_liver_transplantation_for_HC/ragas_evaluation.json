The success of liver transplantation has led to an increase in the indications for liver\ntransplantation. Generally, priorities are given to cirrhotic patients with a high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease\n(MELD) score on the principle of the sickest first and to patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on the principle\nof priority points according to the size and number of nodules of HCC. These criteria can lead to a \u2018competition\u2019 on the\nwaiting list between the above patients and those who are cirrhotic and have an intermediate MELD score or with\nlife-threatening liver diseases not well described by the MELD score. For this latter group of patients, \u2018MELD exception\u2019\npoints can be arbitrarily given.\nDiscussion: The management of patients on the waiting list is of prime importance to avoid death and drop out from\nthe waiting list as well as to improve post-transplant survival rates. For the more severe cases who may swiftly access\nliver transplantation, it is essential to rapidly determine whether liver transplantation is indeed indicated, and to\norganise a fast workup ahead of this. It is also essential to identify the ideal timing for liver transplantation in\norder to minimise mortality rates. For patients with HCC, a bridge therapy is frequently required to avoid progression of\nHCC and to maintain patients within the criteria of liver transplantation as well as to reduce the risk of post-transplant\nrecurrence of HCC. For patients with cirrhosis and intermediate MELD score, waiting time can exceed 1 year; therefore,\nregular follow-up and management are essential to maintain the patient alive on the waiting list and to achieve a\ngood survival after liver transplantation.\nConclusion: There is a diversity of patients on the waiting list for transplantation and equity should be preserved\nbetween those with cirrhosis of high and intermediate severity and those with HCC. The management of patients\non the waiting list is an essential component of the success of liver transplantation.\nKeywords: Liver transplantation, Meld score, Hepatocellular carcinoma, Viral hepatitis, Acute on chronic liver failure,\nCirrhosis, Liver transplant waiting list, Alcoholic cirrhosis\n* Correspondence: didier.samuel@aphp.fr\nCentre H\u00e9patobiliaire, Paul Brousse Hospital, University Paris South,\nInserm-Paris South Research Unit 1193, 12 Avenue Paul-Vaillant Couturier,\nVillejuif, 94800 Paris, France\n\u00a9 The Author(s). 2018 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and\nreproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to\nthe Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

The prognosis after recur\uffference is very poor, with reported median survival times\nranging from 9 to 19 months [4, 7\u201311]. No effective\npostoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for HCC after liver\ntransplantation has been established. To date, the best\noutcomes have been achieved by limiting the indications\nfor transplantation according to tumor status. The Milan\ncriteria have become the global standard guidelines for\nliver transplantation for HCC. Nevertheless, rates of\nrecurrence of HCC within the Milan criteria after liver\ntransplantation have been reported to be 1.6\u201313% [1\u20136].\nThe most commonly reported initial sites of local\nrecurrence after liver transplantation for HCC are the\ngrafted liver (15%), lung (20\u201330%), bone (20\u201325%),\nabdominal lymph node (15%), and adrenal glands (5%)\n[2\u20134, 10, 25]. However, the rate of initial recurrence in\nmultiple sites was reported to be approximately 40%\nwhen systemic recurrence is promoted by circulating\ntumor cells; solitary recurrence is very rare, except at\nthose sites [2, 9, 10, 25]. There are seven published cases\nof pharyngeal metastasis from HCC, which are summa\uffferized along with our case in Table 1 [26\u201332]. The re\ufffeports all describe male patients with a median age of 70\nyears (range 49\u201371 years). Four cases of synchronous\nmetastasis and four cases of metachronous metastasis\nhave been reported. The time between the first treat\ufffement and pharyngeal metastasis was 17\u201358 months in\ncases of metachronous metastasis. Five patients, includ\ufffeing our case, underwent surgery for pharyngeal metasta\ufffeses. The prognosis for all cases except ours was poor;\nfour died within 1 year, two underwent difficult curative\ntreatment, and one experienced multiple recurrences of\npharyngeal metastasis at 1 year after surgery [28\u201332]. Our\nreport is the second to describe solitary recurrence in the\npharyngeal region after liver transplantation and includes\nthe longest surviving case of HCC with pharyngeal\nmetastasis.\nThe mechanism of metastasis to the pharyngeal region\nis controversial, although it has been speculated that there\nare two main pathways: tumor cells may circulate through\nthe vena cava and be distributed to the pharyngeal region\nvia the arterial systemic circulation, or may reach the head\nand neck by bypassing the lungs, possibly through the\nportal\u2013vertebral venous plexus (Batson\u2019s theory) [33]. The\nvertebral venous plexus consists of the internal vertebral\nvenous system distributed around the spinal canal, the ex\ufffeternal vertebral venous plexus distributed in front of the\nvertebral body, and the vertebral vein that anastomoses\nboth of those sites. This plexus communicates with the\nintercostal vein and the azygos vein in each site. In the\nhead and neck region, the plexus communicates with the\npterygium venous plexus, cavernous venous plexus, and\npharyngeal venous plexus around the nasal and paranasal\nFig. 3 Clinical course of patient with pharyngeal metastasis after living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\nTacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil were used as posttransplant immunosuppressive agents, with no steroid administration. Epirubicin was\nadministered during surgery. Pharyngeal metastasis occurred at 1 year and 10 months after LDLT. In addition, at 2 years after pharyngeal\npolypectomy, recurrence of HCC was detected in the regional neck lymph nodes. Recurrence subsequently occurred three times in the grafted\nliver, and local treatment with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and radiofrequency ablation therapy were performed. The patient took",

However, most of the patients with HCC on the\nwaiting list have a compensated liver cirrhosis and a low\nMELD score. Thus, these patients cannot get access to\nliver transplantation through the MELD score. There\ufffefore, patients with HCC on the waiting list will gain\npoints according to the size of the tumour and the num\ufffeber of nodules as well as waiting time duration. There\nare some differences between countries, yet the principle\nis highly similar. In general, no additional points are\ngiven for TNM1 tumours (a single nodule below 2 cm)\nwhere strategies other than liver transplantation should\nbe favoured (i.e. percutaneous radiofrequency, surgical\nresection). In contrast, patients with TNM2 tumours will\ngain points with waiting time. The time between listing\nand transplantation depends on the number of points\ngiven to these patients and may vary according to the\npolicy of the organ-sharing agencies. During this period,\nthe centres should have a strategy to limit or reduce\ntumour growth in order to avoid drop out from the\nwaiting list. It has been shown that a bridge therapy for\nHCC is necessary for projected waiting times of over\n6 months. The treatment of HCC during this period\nmay have a double objective; first, to reduce the size and\nnumber of active tumours in order to place patients\nwithin the criteria for transplantation (downstaging of\nthe tumour) and, second, to reduce and avoid tumour\nprogression. The treatment strategies for HCC may in\ufffeclude percutaneous radiofrequency, surgical resection of\nsome tumour nodules, transarterial chemoembolisation\nand, in some cases, sorafenib [1]. The treatments can be\ncombined according to the type and the progression of\nHCC. Despite these strategies, some patients will drop\nout from the list due to the progression of HCC outside\nthe criteria for transplantation. The three main poor\nprognosis factors in patients with HCC are the regular\nincrease of AFP, an AFP level of over 1000 ng/mL and\nSamuel and Coilly BMC Medicine (2018) 16:113 Page 3 of 5",

The long waiting time\nbetween listing and transplantation has also led to strategies\nfor increasing the donor pool, such as using living donors and\nsplit liver transplantation.17,53 In addition, withdrawal from\nthe waiting list due to disease progression might be reduced\nby use of a locoregional \u201cbridge therapy,\u201d such as TACE or\nablation.54\u201357 There is evidence that response to preoperative\nTACE to \u201cdownstage\u201d HCC led to better long-term survival\nfollowing transplantation, particularly in patients that fit the\nMilan criteria.58,59 Importantly, the number of donors avail\ufffeable for liver transplant has plateaued over the past 10 years\nto \u0001 1500/year for patients with HCC,60 while the number of\npatients with HCC has grown significantly to over 28,000.4\nTherefore, liver transplantation as a treatment for HCC is\nlimited in its scope.\nFor patients who are unsuitable for surgical resection or\nliver transplantation, locoregional therapy using image\ufffeguided percutaneous tumor ablation methods is the treat\ufffement of choice. RFA has demonstrated a superior survival\nbenefit compared with percutaneous ethanol injection in\npatients with early-stage HCC, particularly those with com\ufffepensated liver disease (Child-Pugh A).61 Radiofrequency\nablation was associated with a 5-year OS of 76% when\nused as frontline therapy in patients with resectable HCC\nby BCLC criteria, which is comparable to the survival rates\nachieved historically with surgical resection.62,63 Two pro\ufffespective randomized trials demonstrated that RFA was as\neffective as surgical resection in terms of OS or recurrence\ufffefree survival while being less invasive and having fewer\ncomplications.64,65 These results question the use of surgi\ufffecal resection as standard first-line therapy in all patients\nwith very early-stage HCC, and support consideration of RFA\nin this setting. However, RFA has several limitations and\nshowed suboptimal results in patients with tumor\nsize > 3 cm and perivascularly located tumors.66 To over\ufffecome these limitations, numerous refinements of ablation\nmethods are under clinical testing, including laser ablation,\nmicrowave ablation, cryoablation light-activated therapy,\nand irreversible electroporation.\nIntermediate-Stage HCC\nPatients with large multimodal tumors, preserved liver func\ufffetion, and no vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread who are\nineligible for radical surgical therapies or percutaneous abla\ufffetion are usually treated with TACE.17 Transarterial chemo\ufffeembolization involves the intra-arterial injection of a\ncytotoxic agent (doxorubicin, cisplatin, or mitomycin), with\nor without lipiodol, plus an embolic agent into the hepatic\nartery that supplies the tumor. In a meta-analysis of seven\nstudies, TACE demonstrated a significant improvement in\n2-year survival (odds ratio \u00bc 0.53; p \u00bc 0.017) compared with\nbest supportive care.67 However, patient selection appears to\nSeminars in Liver Disease Vol. 33 Suppl. 1/2013\nS6 Multidisciplinary Management of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Marrero",
                "Background\nLiver transplantation plays a major role in the thera\ufffepeutic path of liver diseases [1]. It concerns all patients\nwith end-stage liver disease when other medical therap\ufffeies have failed as well as a high number of patients with\nprimary liver cancer, mainly hepatocellular carcinoma\n(HCC). The success of liver transplantation over the past\nyears has been considerable, with more than 5000 being\nperformed annually in Europe, surmounting to more\nthan 140,000 liver transplantations in total [2]. Such suc\ufffecess comes as a consequence of the absence of alterna\ufffetive therapies and of the good post-transplant survival of\napproximately 90 and 80% at 1 and 5 years, respectively.\nIn Europe, liver donors are mainly of cadaver origin,\neither following brain death or cardiac arrest, under the\nMaastricht 3 procedure [1]. In contrast to living donor\ntransplantation, where the date of liver transplantation is\nknown in advance, in cadaveric donor liver transplant\ufffeation the date of liver transplantation is unknown.\nTherefore, the wait for transplantation can vary from a\nfew days in the case of acute liver failure patients to\nmore than 1 year for patients with cirrhosis of inter\ufffemediate severity or those with HCC. The waiting lists\nfor liver transplantation are composed of three types of\npatient. (1) Those with acute liver failure, included, in\nmost countries, in a super-emergency waiting list giving\nthem absolute priority over all other recipients, and re\ufffeceiving a transplant within hours or days [3]. (2) Those\nwith decompensated liver cirrhosis, included in the wait\ufffeing list on the principle of the \u2018sickest first\u2019, based mainly\non the calculation of the Model for End Stage Liver\nDiseases (MELD) score. Those with very high MELD\nscore may likely access liver transplantation within days\nor a few weeks, whereas those with intermediate or low\nMELD scores will access liver transplantation within\nmonths or even years. (3) Those with HCC on compen\ufffesated liver cirrhosis. Organ-sharing agencies assign these\npatients an artificial score according to the number and\nsize of tumours, providing them access to liver trans\ufffeplantation within a maximum of 18 months. Since the\nnumber of candidates on the waiting list is greater than\nthe offer of viable livers, there is some degree of compe\ufffetition between patients. Liver centres should manage\ntheir patients according to their clinical situation and\nthe expected waiting time for liver transplantation. For a\npatient with an end-stage liver disease, the procedure of\nliver transplantation and the postoperative period re\ufffemain a heavy procedure. Therefore, patients should be\ncarefully prepared physically and mentally to undergo\ntransplantation, much like an athlete preparing for the\nOlympic games. The management of patients on the\nwaiting list is essential to avoid death or drop out due to\ndeterioration of their condition as well as to ensure that\npatients are in the best physical condition possible prior\nto the procedure \u2013 this is essential for the success of the\npost-operative course.\nManagement of patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis\nIn the USA, the MELD score has been implemented since\n2002 as a score to prioritise access to liver transplantation\n[4]. Most countries in Europe have implemented the\nprinciple of the \u2018sickest first\u2019 to prioritise such access also\nbased on the MELD score, despite some differences be\ufffetween countries. The principle of the \u2018sickest first\u2019 is one\nof justice and has achieved a reduction in mortality whilst\non the waiting list in most countries. However, there are\nseveral inherent issues that must be addressed.\nFirst, the MELD score, calculated from bilirubin, cre\ufffeatinine and international normalised ratio levels, is not\nthe holy grail [4\u20136]. Some patients with severe liver dis\ufffeeases are poorly represented by the MELD score, such\nas, for example, patients with cholestatic diseases, who\nhave, until the very late stage, a low MELD score due to",
                "Background\nIn 1996, Mazzaferro et al. reported that when liver trans\ufffeplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was re\ufffestricted to patients with early-stage disease (defined as a\nsingle tumor less than 5 cm in diameter, or up to three\ntumors less than 3 cm in diameter, without vascular in\ufffevasion or extrahepatic metastasis), the 4-year survival\nrate was 75%, similar to survival rates for patients with\nnon-HCC liver disease [1]. These criteria, which were\nsoon termed the \u201cMilan criteria,\u201d became the worldwide\nbenchmark for liver transplantation criteria for HCC.\nThe Milan criteria, limiting the indications for liver\ntransplantation for HCC, have reduced the postoperative\nrecurrence rate of HCC. However, HCC still recurs in\n1.6\u201313% of recipients within the Milan criteria after liver\ntransplantation [1\u20136]. There have been many reports of\ncases with multiple instances of recurrence due to sys\ufffetemic recurrence caused by extra-hepatic circulating\ntumor cells. The prognosis after recurrence of HCC is\npoor, with reported median survival ranging from 9 to\n19 months in major transplant centers in both Western\nand Eastern countries [4, 7\u201312]. However, if the recur\uffference remains local, such as within the liver, lung, or ad\uffferenal gland, surgical resection may improve prognosis,\nand cases of long-term survival have been reported [4,\n6\u20138, 10, 11, 13]. Here, we report a case of long-term sur\ufffevival after resection of the pharyngeal metastasis due to\nHCC recurrence after living-donor liver transplantation\n(LDLT).\nCase presentation\nA 47-year-old man with a Model End-stage Liver Dis\ufffeease (MELD) score of 11 and liver cirrhosis associated\nwith hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection underwent LDLT\nfor HCC, with his 48-year-old elder brother as the living\ndonor, in November 2004. He had received transarterial\nchemoembolization (TACE) 5 months before liver trans\ufffeplantation and was assessed as having a partial response\naccording to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria\nin Solid Tumors (mRECIST) [14]. The patient had no\nhistory of other diseases, and there were also no diseases\nof note in his family history. The right lobe of the donor\nwas harvested and weighed 710 g (graft-to-recipient\nweight ratio, 1.09). The donor and recipient had the\nsame blood type. Preoperative abdominal computed\ntomography (CT) revealed liver cirrhosis with three\nhypervascular nodules, diagnosed as HCC, which were\n2.0, 2.5, and 2.8 cm in diameter and met the Milan cri\ufffeteria (Fig. 1a).

In the most recent study with\n21 years of follow-up, this corresponded to an excess mortality of\n70% (standardised mortality ratio 1.7; 95% CI 1.24 to 2.25).15\nNeed for liver transplantation\nThe increase in the number of patients with advanced liver\ndisease secondary to NASH, as well as associated HCC, will\nimpact on the potential future demand for LT. Analysis of\nNational Health Service Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) data\nshows that in both 2008 and 2009, 12% of patients placed on the\nelective LT waiting list were categorised as having NASH\ncirrhosis, with 14.8% of these individuals with NASH listed\nwith HCC. Consistent with the known association with insulin\nresistance, 49.1% of patients with NASH cirrhosis listed for LT\nwere diabetic compared with 22.1% of all other registered\npatients (although the criteria for the definition of DM were not\nwell defined).\nINDICATIONS FOR LIVER TRANSPLANTATION IN NASH\nRELATED CIRRHOSIS\nGiven that LT is a relatively recently identified indication for\npatients with NASH, data for long term follow-up are more\nlimited compared with LT for other causes of chronic liver\ndisease. Nevertheless, data from several American centres\nsuggest that patients with NASH do not have an inferior\noutcome 1, 2 and 5 years after LT when compared with other\naetiologies of liver disease.25e27\nThere are no data to suggest that the natural history of\ncirrhosis after an initial clinical decompensation or the rate of\nchange of Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score differ\nfor patients with NASH compared with other causes of\ncirrhosis. Hence the current recommendation should be that\nthere are no disease specific indications for listing for LT in\nthis condition and that those currently useddthat is, MELD\nscore and/or specific variant indications (eg, diuretic resistant/\nintolerant ascites)dshould remain. In those patients with HCC\non the background of NASH related cirrhosis, there are no data\nto support modification of the general criteria for listing for LT.\nMany patients with end stage liver disease have a presumptive\ndiagnosis of NASH. Patients may have a longstanding history or\nDM/hypertension with no other obvious reason for cirrhosis\nother than presumed previous NASH. Generally, when such\npatients present with liver decompensation they do not undergo\nliver biopsy, hence the need for standardisation of diagnosing\nNASH. As such, in the absence of a histological diagnosis of\nNASH, the presence of cirrhosis with a clinical phenotype\ncompatible with underlying NASH, as defined by the presence of\nthree or more components of the metabolic syndrome28 prior to\nLT, is sufficient.\nRecommendation 1: Criteria for diagnosis of NASH should\ninclude an established clinical and histological diagnosis of\nNASH on liver biopsy, or a histological diagnosis of cryptogenic\ncirrhosis with a clinical phenotype compatible with underlying\nNASH, as defined by the presence of three or more components\nof the metabolic syndrome prior to LT. (Level C, Class I).\nRecommendation 2: Criteria for consideration of listing for\nLT in patients with NASH cirrhosis either due to end stage liver\ndisease or the presence of HCC should be in line with standard\nnational criteria.

                "However, Facciuto et al [11] reported that 5-year survivals of 35%\nfor HCC patients beyond Milan criteria, and Fong et al. [4],\nreported 3-year and 5-year survivals of 48% and 33%, respec\ufffetively, for patients with tumors greater than 5 cm. One\nexplanation for this discrepancy is that a large proportion of\nHCC in our series were within Milan criteria. The 1-, 3- and 5-\nyear survival rates were 90, 81, and 72% and 1-, 3- and 5-year\nrecurrence rates of 11, 25, and 31% in the primary LT group,\nwhich showed reduced incidence of recurrence and improved\nsurvival compared to LR group. In fact, similar results had been\nobserved by some previous studies [26\u201328]. However, the choice\nof a particular treatment option would depend on individual liver\nfunction and availability of a donor liver in the setting of shortage\nof donor organs. Our purpose was not to compare two treatment\ngroups, but to ascertain the outcome of a combined strategy\nemploying prior LR and salvage LT for HCC meeting UCSF\ncriteria.\nMoreover, LR has several advantages for patients with HCC\nmeeting UCSF criteria and well-preserved liver function. First, LR\nis technically far less complex than LT and can be performed\nwithout delay. Second, for patients with HCC meeting UCSF\ncriteria and well-preserved liver function, LR would achieve\nrecurrence-free, long-term survival in nearly a half of patients in\nour series, and a half of grafts are saved for the community and\ncan be transplanted to other patients who have no other\nalternative. Last but not least, patients with HCC beyond Milan\ncriteria are at higher risk of disease progression and higher\ndropout rate on waiting list [29]. LR could achieve initial control\nof the tumor and decrease dropout rate, leaving salvage LT as a\nreserve option to manage recurrence.\nThe Milan criteria [7] for HCC have been widely used as the\nguideline for the selection of candidates for LT in many\ntransplantation centers. In recent years, some investigators have\nargued that the Milan criteria are too restrictive and limit the\ntransplant option at a time when the incidence of HCC is\nincreasing. Several recent series have demonstrated good out\ufffecomes using expanded criteria (the UCSF criteria), with long-term\nsurvival similar to Milan criteria [18,30\u201332]. Similar results were\nobserved in our study. In the present report of 219 patients\nmanaged in a single institution, LT is confirmed as appropriate\nand effective treatment for patients with HCC meeting UCSF\ncriteria, with 1, 3, 5-year survival rates of 89%, 80%, 69% and 1,\n3, 5-year recurrence rates of 12%, 24%, 32%, respectively.\nSalvage LT, which was first proposed by Majno et al [8], is\nrestricted to patients who develop recurrence within Milan criteria\nand could represent a loss of opportunity for the subgroup of\npatients who develop recurrence beyond Milan criteria. Recently,\nKaido et al [15] reported that the selection criteria for salvage LT\nto treat recurrent HCC could be expanded to Kyoto criteria\n(tumor number #10, the maximal diameter of each tumor was\n#5 cm and serum des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin levels of\n#400 mAU/mL). However, the patient cohort in their study was\nsmall and the Kyoto criteria was based on salvage LDLT. As\nmentioned above, LT for HCC within UCSF criteria could\nachieve excellent long-term survival similar to Milan criteria.\nNevertheless, little is known about outcomes for salvage LT in\npatients with recurrent HCC within UCSF criteria after LR.\nHence, a study about salvage LT for recurrent HCC within UCSF\ncriteria was of great value. Here, we found favorable short- and\nlong-term outcomes in 39 patients who underwent LT for\nrecurrent HCC meeting UCSF criteria after LR.\nAlthough the intraoperative blood loss and required blood\ntransfusion were more frequent than primary LT group, the\noperation time was not prolonged in salvage LT group. Moreover,\nthe perioperative mortality and posttransplant complications were\nsimilar in the salvage and primary LT groups. The larger volume"

The success of liver transplantation has led to an increase in the indications for liver\ntransplantation. Generally, priorities are given to cirrhotic patients with a high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease\n(MELD) score on the principle of the sickest first and to patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on the principle\nof priority points according to the size and number of nodules of HCC. These criteria can lead to a \u2018competition\u2019 on the\nwaiting list between the above patients and those who are cirrhotic and have an intermediate MELD score or with\nlife-threatening liver diseases not well described by the MELD score. For this latter group of patients, \u2018MELD exception\u2019\npoints can be arbitrarily given.\nDiscussion: The management of patients on the waiting list is of prime importance to avoid death and drop out from\nthe waiting list as well as to improve post-transplant survival rates. For the more severe cases who may swiftly access\nliver transplantation, it is essential to rapidly determine whether liver transplantation is indeed indicated, and to\norganise a fast workup ahead of this. It is also essential to identify the ideal timing for liver transplantation in\norder to minimise mortality rates. For patients with HCC, a bridge therapy is frequently required to avoid progression of\nHCC and to maintain patients within the criteria of liver transplantation as well as to reduce the risk of post-transplant\nrecurrence of HCC. For patients with cirrhosis and intermediate MELD score, waiting time can exceed 1 year; therefore,\nregular follow-up and management are essential to maintain the patient alive on the waiting list and to achieve a\ngood survival after liver transplantation.\nConclusion: There is a diversity of patients on the waiting list for transplantation and equity should be preserved\nbetween those with cirrhosis of high and intermediate severity and those with HCC. The management of patients\non the waiting list is an essential component of the success of liver transplantation.\nKeywords: Liver transplantation, Meld score, Hepatocellular carcinoma, Viral hepatitis, Acute on chronic liver failure,\nCirrhosis, Liver transplant waiting list, Alcoholic cirrhosis\n* Correspondence: didier.samuel@aphp.fr\nCentre H\u00e9patobiliaire, Paul Brousse Hospital, University Paris South,\nInserm-Paris South Research Unit 1193, 12 Avenue Paul-Vaillant Couturier,\nVillejuif, 94800 Paris, France\n\u00a9 The Author(s). 2018 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and\nreproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to\nthe Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

It concerns all patients\nwith end-stage liver disease when other medical therap\ufffeies have failed as well as a high number of patients with\nprimary liver cancer, mainly hepatocellular carcinoma\n(HCC). The success of liver transplantation over the past\nyears has been considerable, with more than 5000 being\nperformed annually in Europe, surmounting to more\nthan 140,000 liver transplantations in total [2]. Such suc\ufffecess comes as a consequence of the absence of alterna\ufffetive therapies and of the good post-transplant survival of\napproximately 90 and 80% at 1 and 5 years, respectively.\nIn Europe, liver donors are mainly of cadaver origin,\neither following brain death or cardiac arrest, under the\nMaastricht 3 procedure [1]. In contrast to living donor\ntransplantation, where the date of liver transplantation is\nknown in advance, in cadaveric donor liver transplant\ufffeation the date of liver transplantation is unknown.\nTherefore, the wait for transplantation can vary from a\nfew days in the case of acute liver failure patients to\nmore than 1 year for patients with cirrhosis of inter\ufffemediate severity or those with HCC. The waiting lists\nfor liver transplantation are composed of three types of\npatient. (1) Those with acute liver failure, included, in\nmost countries, in a super-emergency waiting list giving\nthem absolute priority over all other recipients, and re\ufffeceiving a transplant within hours or days [3]. (2) Those\nwith decompensated liver cirrhosis, included in the wait\ufffeing list on the principle of the \u2018sickest first\u2019, based mainly\non the calculation of the Model for End Stage Liver\nDiseases (MELD) score. Those with very high MELD\nscore may likely access liver transplantation within days\nor a few weeks, whereas those with intermediate or low\nMELD scores will access liver transplantation within\nmonths or even years. (3) Those with HCC on compen\ufffesated liver cirrhosis. Organ-sharing agencies assign these\npatients an artificial score according to the number and\nsize of tumours, providing them access to liver trans\ufffeplantation within a maximum of 18 months. Since the\nnumber of candidates on the waiting list is greater than\nthe offer of viable livers, there is some degree of compe\ufffetition between patients. Liver centres should manage\ntheir patients according to their clinical situation and\nthe expected waiting time for liver transplantation. For a\npatient with an end-stage liver disease, the procedure of\nliver transplantation and the postoperative period re\ufffemain a heavy procedure. Therefore, patients should be\ncarefully prepared physically and mentally to undergo\ntransplantation, much like an athlete preparing for the\nOlympic games. The management of patients on the\nwaiting list is essential to avoid death or drop out due to\ndeterioration of their condition as well as to ensure that\npatients are in the best physical condition possible prior\nto the procedure \u2013 this is essential for the success of the\npost-operative course.\nManagement of patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis\nIn the USA, the MELD score has been implemented since\n2002 as a score to prioritise access to liver transplantation\n[4]. Most countries in Europe have implemented the\nprinciple of the \u2018sickest first\u2019 to prioritise such access also\nbased on the MELD score, despite some differences be\ufffetween countries. The principle of the \u2018sickest first\u2019 is one\nof justice and has achieved a reduction in mortality whilst\non the waiting list in most countries. However, there are\nseveral inherent issues that must be addressed.\nFirst, the MELD score, calculated from bilirubin, cre\ufffeatinine and international normalised ratio levels, is not\nthe holy grail [4\u20136]. Some patients with severe liver dis\ufffeeases are poorly represented by the MELD score, such\nas, for example, patients with cholestatic diseases, who\nhave, until the very late stage, a low MELD score due to\nnormal international normalised ratio and creatinine\nlevels, patients with refractory ascites and otherwise pre\ufffeserved liver function, patients with chronic encephalop\ufffeathy due to portacaval shunts, and patients with\nhepatopulmonary syndrome. Thus, these patients should\nbe offered MELD exception points to provide them the\npossibility to access liver transplantation [7].\nManagement of patients with high MELD score or in the\nintensive care unit (ICU)\nThere is a debate regarding the high mortality risk after\nliver transplantation in patients with a high MELD score\n[8]. Some authors consider that transplantation in these\npatients can be futile. On the one hand, the survival\nbenefit for these patients is extremely high as shown in\npatients with severe acute alcoholic hepatitis or with\nacute-on-chronic liver failure [9, 10]; on the other, the\nhigh mortality rates after liver transplantation can be\nconsidered a waste of organs [8]. The MELD score is\nhighly predictive of the risk of mortality on the waiting\nlist [4, 11]. Patients on the waiting list with a MELD\nscore of over 30 or 40 have an expected mortality rate of\nmore than 50 and 70%, respectively, within 3 months\n[4]. Therefore, there is justification to prioritise these pa\ufffetients. In patients with very high MELD scores (> 35),\nthere is a risk of high post-transplant mortality and of\nover indication for liver transplantation. There is a con\ufffesensus that for scores up to MELD 35, post-transplant\nsurvival remains unmodified. In patients with a MELD\nscore above 35, there is currently no consensus on the\npotentially higher risk of post-transplant morbidity and\nmortality [12]; however, the postoperative morbidity and\nICU length of stay are significantly higher [12, 13]. Inter\ufffeestingly, the percentage of patients with chronic liver\ndisease transplanted while in the ICU or soon after\nSamuel and Coilly BMC Medicine (2018) 16:113 Page 2 of 5\n\nrecovery remains low (< 10%) [14]. There are several rea\ufffesons for this. First, patients in the ICU are frequently not\nevaluated for liver transplantation either because they are\nnot in a liver ICU or because liver transplantation is con\ufffesidered too risky and futile. Several authors have tried to\ndetermine, through scores such as the Frailty scoring sys\ufffetem [15] or other scores [16], the limits at which trans\ufffeplantation is futile. Our personal opinion is that this line\nof futility is permanently evolving.\nConsidering the dramatic improvement of the results\nof liver transplantation over the past years, we need to\nbe more reactive regarding the indication of liver trans\ufffeplantation in the most severe patients, i.e. those in the\nICU. When a patient is referred in a critical condition,\nthe very first question to address is: is this patient a po\ufffetential candidate for liver transplantation? For alcoholic\ncirrhotic patients, or for patients with acute alcoholic\nhepatitis refractory to medical treatment, this will re\ufffequire an urgent workup, advice from a specialist in alco\ufffehol addiction, and a consensus decision from the team\n[9]. When the decision for liver transplantation is taken,\npatient prognosis should be assessed using ICU scores\nrather than the MELD score [17, 18]. An urgent workup\nto assess comorbidities is also required. The difficult\nissue is the definition of the optimal window for trans\ufffeplantation in such severe cases. The risk is to perform\ntransplantation in patients without an adequate workup\nat the worse moment. Therefore, coordination with the\nICU specialists in order to determine the appropriate\ntiming for liver transplantation is essential. The optimal\ntransplantation window between several complications is\ndifficult to determine, but essential for its success. This\ntransplantation window may be open during the ICU\nstay or soon after recovery prior to the advent of the\nnext deteriorating event [19].\nManagement of patients with intermediate MELD score\nIn many countries, patients with a MELD score between\n18 and 25 have difficulty obtaining access to liver trans\ufffeplantation. The waiting time for these patients is long\nand may exceed 1 year, with a risk of acute deterioration\nof their liver condition. The position of most\norgan-sharing agencies is that patients will be offered\ntransplantation as soon as the MELD score increases.\nHowever, some patients may deteriorate rapidly and die\nfollowing new gastrointestinal bleeding or a septic shock\nepisodes. The other option, not yet considered by\norgan-sharing agencies, is to assign these patients add\ufffeitional points in relation to the length of waiting time on\nthe list, taking into account the natural history of liver\ncirrhosis. We find it logical to provide such patients with\nthe possibility to increase their priority in the waiting\nlist. During this waiting time, patients should be\nmaintained in the best possible condition until\ntransplantation, being followed on a regular basis either\nby the transplant centre or by the referring centre. For\nthis, several actions have to be taken, as follows: (1) in\nhepatitis C virus cirrhotic patients, an antiviral treatment\nwith interferon-free direct antiviral agents should be dis\ufffecussed [20\u201322]; (2) patients should be regularly screened\nwith Doppler ultrasound of the liver for emergence of\nHCC; (3) prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding by rou\ufffetine endoscopy should be performed; and (4) patients with\nrefractory ascites should be treated either by TIPS or by it\ufffeerative paracentesis to avoid malnutrition and other com\ufffeplications of refractory ascites. Additionally, it has been\nshown that physical activity during the waiting time is\nbeneficial for the patient and may improve its VO2 [23].\nManagement of patients with HCC\nPatients with HCC on decompensated liver cirrhosis\nmay have access to transplantation through the MELD\nscore. However, most of the patients with HCC on the\nwaiting list have a compensated liver cirrhosis and a low\nMELD score. Thus, these patients cannot get access to\nliver transplantation through the MELD score. There\ufffefore, patients with HCC on the waiting list will gain\npoints according to the size of the tumour and the num\ufffeber of nodules as well as waiting time duration. There\nare some differences between countries, yet the principle\nis highly similar. In general, no additional points are\ngiven for TNM1 tumours (a single nodule below 2 cm)\nwhere strategies other than liver transplantation should\nbe favoured (i.e. percutaneous radiofrequency, surgical\nresection). In contrast, patients with TNM2 tumours will\ngain points with waiting time. The time between listing\nand transplantation depends on the number of points\ngiven to these patients and may vary according to the\npolicy of the organ-sharing agencies. During this period,\nthe centres should have a strategy to limit or reduce\ntumour growth in order to avoid drop out from the\nwaiting list. It has been shown that a bridge therapy for\nHCC is necessary for projected waiting times of over\n6 months. The treatment of HCC during this period\nmay have a double objective; first, to reduce the size and\nnumber of active tumours in order to place patients\nwithin the criteria for transplantation (downstaging of\nthe tumour) and, second, to reduce and avoid tumour\nprogression. The treatment strategies for HCC may in\ufffeclude percutaneous radiofrequency, surgical resection of\nsome tumour nodules, transarterial chemoembolisation\nand, in some cases, sorafenib [1]. The treatments can be\ncombined according to the type and the progression of\nHCC. Despite these strategies, some patients will drop\nout from the list due to the progression of HCC outside\nthe criteria for transplantation. The three main poor\nprognosis factors in patients with HCC are the regular\nincrease of AFP, an AFP level of over 1000 ng/mL and\nSamuel and Coilly BMC Medicine (2018) 16:113 Page 3 of 5\n\nthe invasion of the portal vein by the tumour [24, 25].\nThese factors can become a contraindication for liver\ntransplantation due to the high risk of recurrence after\nliver transplantation.\nIs there a competition on the waiting list between patients\nwith decompensated liver cirrhosis, patients with MELD\nexceptions and patients with HCC?\nSince the points assigned to patients with HCC are given\narbitrarily, there is a risk of disequilibrium in favour of\nthese patients depending on the weight given to these\npoints. It is true that, in most countries, the percentage\nof patients on the waiting list with HCC is increasing,\nand is currently at 30\u201340%. Such an increase is due to\nthe epidemiology of liver diseases, the increasing num\ufffeber of patients with HCC and the high benefit in sur\ufffevival by liver transplantation to patients with HCC. In\naddition, the criteria for liver transplantation for HCC\nhave evolved. Since 1996, the Milan criteria (one nodule\nof \u2264 5 cm or three nodules \u2264 3 cm without vascular inva\ufffesion) were the validated criteria for liver transplantation\nfor HCC [26]. With these criteria, the recurrence of\nHCC after liver transplantation was below 10%. The\nMilan citeria are still the validated international criteria.\nThere is a push from several teams to expand these cri\ufffeteria. In France, the Milan criteria have been replaced by\nthe AFP score [24] . Therefore, several new criteria have\nbeen proposed. The UCSF criteria (1 nodule \u2264 6.5 cm or\nn \u2264 3 nodules \u2264 4.5 cm or total sum \u2264 8 cm) [27]; the up\nto seven criteria (number of nodules + the maximum\nsize of the tumour without vascular invasion should be 7\nat maximum) [28]; and the AFP score, taking into ac\ufffecount the size, number of nodules and the level of AFP\n(applied in France) [24].\nDue to the improvement in efficacy of antiviral treat\ufffements, the number of patients with decompensated, hepa\ufffetitis B and C virus liver cirrhosis is sharply declining [29].\nIn contrast, the number of patients with decompensated\nliver disease due to alcoholic cirrhosis has shown no de\ufffecreases, and the number of patients with decompensated\nliver disease due to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis has been\nincreasing, as shown already in the USA [30].\nThus, it is highly important that organ-sharing agen\ufffecies maintain a good balance between the different indi\ufffecations for liver transplantation, thus avoiding an\nincrease in mortality or drop out from the waiting list\nfor any one category of patients. It is important to pro\ufffevide liver transplantation access to the sickest patients\nwith decompensated liver diseases, as well as to patients\nwith HCC and those with decompensated cirrhosis and\nintermediate MELD score. Some authors consider that\npatients with MELD exceptions should be prioritised\nover those with very high MELD scores. The perfect\nequation does not exist, yet a real time assessment of\nthe dynamic of the waiting list by the organ-sharing\nagencies is essential to maintain equity.\nConclusion\nPhysicians should indicate liver transplantation for those\nwho will gain the most benefit from it, and should opti\ufffemise the management of these patients during the wait\ufffeing period in order to reduce the rate of dropout and to\nimprove the results after liver transplantation. Finally,\ngiven the shortage of organs, physicians should balance\nthe benefit for the society with those to individual pa\ufffetients. These should not be in opposition and we should\nwork on increasing the organ pool and access to liver\ntransplantation, as well as on improving the results of\nliver transplantation.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank the medico-surgical team at the Centre H\u00e9patobiliaire at Hospital\nPaul Brousse.\nFunding\nDidier Samuel and Audrey Coilly are salaried by the Assistance publique\nH\u00f4pitaux de Paris and the Universit\u00e9 Paris Sud.

The prognosis after recurrence is poor, with reported median survival after recurrence of\nHCC ranging from 9 to 19 months. Here, we report a case of long-term survival after recurrence of pharyngeal\nmetastasis following living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for HCC within the Milan criteria, by resection of the\nmetastatic region and cervical lymph node dissection.\nCase presentation: A 47-year-old man with a Model End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score of 11 underwent LDLT\nfor HCC within the Milan criteria for liver cirrhosis associated with hepatitis B virus infection, with his 48-year-old\nelder brother as the living donor. One year and 10 months after liver transplantation, he visited a nearby hospital\nwith a chief complaint of discomfort on swallowing. A pedunculated polyp was found in the hypopharynx, and\nbiopsy revealed HCC metastasis. We performed pharyngeal polypectomy. Two years later, cervical lymph node\nmetastasis appeared, and neck lymph node dissection was performed. Although recurrence subsequently occurred\nthree times in the grafted liver, the patient is still alive 12 years and 10 months after recurrence of pharyngeal\nmetastasis. He is now a tumor-free outpatient taking sorafenib.\nConclusion: It is necessary to recognize that the nasopharyngeal region is a potential site of HCC metastasis.\nPrognostic improvement can be expected with close follow-up, early detection, and multidisciplinary treatment,\nincluding radical resection.\nKeywords: Hepatocellular carcinoma, Pharyngeal metastasis, Nasopharynx, Liver transplantation, Vertebral venous plexus\n\u00a9 The Author(s). 2020 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License,\nwhich permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give\nappropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if\nchanges were made.

World Journal of Surgical Oncology (2020) 18:109 \nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/s12957-020-01873-0\n\nBackground\nIn 1996, Mazzaferro et al. reported that when liver trans\ufffeplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was re\ufffestricted to patients with early-stage disease (defined as a\nsingle tumor less than 5 cm in diameter, or up to three\ntumors less than 3 cm in diameter, without vascular in\ufffevasion or extrahepatic metastasis), the 4-year survival\nrate was 75%, similar to survival rates for patients with\nnon-HCC liver disease [1]. These criteria, which were\nsoon termed the \u201cMilan criteria,\u201d became the worldwide\nbenchmark for liver transplantation criteria for HCC.\nThe Milan criteria, limiting the indications for liver\ntransplantation for HCC, have reduced the postoperative\nrecurrence rate of HCC. However, HCC still recurs in\n1.6\u201313% of recipients within the Milan criteria after liver\ntransplantation [1\u20136]. There have been many reports of\ncases with multiple instances of recurrence due to sys\ufffetemic recurrence caused by extra-hepatic circulating\ntumor cells. The prognosis after recurrence of HCC is\npoor, with reported median survival ranging from 9 to\n19 months in major transplant centers in both Western\nand Eastern countries [4, 7\u201312]. However, if the recur\uffference remains local, such as within the liver, lung, or ad\uffferenal gland, surgical resection may improve prognosis,\nand cases of long-term survival have been reported [4,\n6\u20138, 10, 11, 13]. Here, we report a case of long-term sur\ufffevival after resection of the pharyngeal metastasis due to\nHCC recurrence after living-donor liver transplantation\n(LDLT).\nCase presentation\nA 47-year-old man with a Model End-stage Liver Dis\ufffeease (MELD) score of 11 and liver cirrhosis associated\nwith hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection underwent LDLT\nfor HCC, with his 48-year-old elder brother as the living\ndonor, in November 2004. He had received transarterial\nchemoembolization (TACE) 5 months before liver trans\ufffeplantation and was assessed as having a partial response\naccording to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria\nin Solid Tumors (mRECIST) [14]. The patient had no\nhistory of other diseases, and there were also no diseases\nof note in his family history. The right lobe of the donor\nwas harvested and weighed 710 g (graft-to-recipient\nweight ratio, 1.09). The donor and recipient had the\nsame blood type. Preoperative abdominal computed\ntomography (CT) revealed liver cirrhosis with three\nhypervascular nodules, diagnosed as HCC, which were\n2.0, 2.5, and 2.8 cm in diameter and met the Milan cri\ufffeteria (Fig. 1a). Preoperative tumor marker levels were as\nfollows: \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP), 5 ng/ml; and des- -\nFig. 1 Computed tomography (CT) images before living-donor liver transplantation and histopathological findings of the resected native liver. a\nPreoperative abdominal CT showing liver cirrhosis with three hypervascular nodules that were 20, 25, and 28 mm in diameter.

Pathological\nexamination of the resected liver revealed one moder\ufffeately differentiated HCC with necrotic change in a 2.4-cm\narea, and multiple well-differentiated HCC lesions measur\ufffeing a few millimeters that appeared to indicate multicentric\noccurrence. Microvascular invasion was not seen (Fig. 1b, c,\nd). We used tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)\nas posttransplant immunosuppressive agents; no steroids\nwere employed. The early postoperative course was un\ufffeeventful, and the patient was discharged 74 days postopera\ufffetively. He received epirubicin at a dose of 10 mg/m2 during\nsurgery, but did not receive postoperative chemotherapy.\nHe was followed up by abdominal ultrasonography (US)\nevery 3 months and by abdominal CT at 1, 3, 6, and 12\nmonths after surgery, and every 6 months thereafter. The\nAFP and DCP levels were checked monthly. Lamivudine\nwas administered to control HBV virus, and HBV DNA\nwas consistently negative after transplantation. In Septem\ufffeber 2006, 22 months after LDLT, he visited a nearby hos\ufffepital with a chief complaint of discomfort on swallowing. A\npedunculated polyp was found in the hypopharynx (Fig.\n2a), and biopsy revealed HCC metastasis. Cervical CT re\ufffevealed a pharyngeal polyp on the right side of the epiglottis;\nalso, faint fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) accumulation was rec\ufffeognized, consistent with a pharyngeal polyp on FDG posi\ufffetron emission tomography (PET)-CT examination (Fig. 2b,\nc). Polypectomy was performed on October 2006.\nHistological examination revealed that the tumor cells\nwere positive for anti-hepatocyte antigen staining and a\ndiagnosis of metastasis of HCC was made (Fig. 2d, e).\nHe was administered tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil (TS-1)\nafter polypectomy. Two years after pharyngeal poly\ufffepectomy, recurrence in neck lymph nodes was detected\n(Fig. 2f, g), and neck lymph node dissection was per\ufffeformed. Recurrence subsequently occurred three times\nin the graft liver, and local treatment with TACE and\nradiofrequency ablation therapy was performed. The\npatient was started on oral sorafenib 3 years ago, is still\nalive 12 years and 10 months after recurrence of\npharyngeal metastasis, and is now a tumor-free out\ufffepatient in good health continuing to take a low dose of\nsorafenib (Fig. 3).\nDiscussion\nLiver transplantation is the only curative treatment for\nHCC associated with severe liver cirrhosis [15\u201317]. The\ncritical shortage of deceased donor organs has led to the\nrapid development of LDLT in Eastern countries, including\nJapan, Korea, and China. And in contrast to deceased donor\nliver transplantation, recipient selection for LDLT is not\nlimited by organ allocation systems. Subsequently, many\ncenters have developed expanded center-specific criteria\nFig. 2 Pharyngeal metastasis and cervical lymph node metastasis following living-donor liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). a\nMacroscopic findings of a pedunculated polyp-shaped pharyngeal metastatic lesion. b Cervical computed tomography (CT) revealing a pharyngeal\npolyp on the right side of the epiglottis. c Faint fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) accumulation consistent with the pharyngeal polyp as observed using FDG\npositron emission tomography (PET)-CT. d Histological examination showing polygonal dysplastic epithelial cells with a trabecular or pseudotubular\nstructure that had proliferated under the mucous membrane covered with the squamous epithelium. e These tumor cells stained positively for anti\ufffehepatocyte-specific antigen and were diagnosed as indicative of HCC metastasis. f Cervical CT showing regional neck lymph node swelling at 2 years\nafter pharyngeal polypectomy. g PET-CT scan indicating that there was almost no FDG accumulation in the enlarged cervical lymph node\nTohyama et al.

The prognosis after recur\uffference is very poor, with reported median survival times\nranging from 9 to 19 months [4, 7\u201311]. No effective\npostoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for HCC after liver\ntransplantation has been established. To date, the best\noutcomes have been achieved by limiting the indications\nfor transplantation according to tumor status. The Milan\ncriteria have become the global standard guidelines for\nliver transplantation for HCC. Nevertheless, rates of\nrecurrence of HCC within the Milan criteria after liver\ntransplantation have been reported to be 1.6\u201313% [1\u20136].\nThe most commonly reported initial sites of local\nrecurrence after liver transplantation for HCC are the\ngrafted liver (15%), lung (20\u201330%), bone (20\u201325%),\nabdominal lymph node (15%), and adrenal glands (5%)\n[2\u20134, 10, 25]. However, the rate of initial recurrence in\nmultiple sites was reported to be approximately 40%\nwhen systemic recurrence is promoted by circulating\ntumor cells; solitary recurrence is very rare, except at\nthose sites [2, 9, 10, 25]. There are seven published cases\nof pharyngeal metastasis from HCC, which are summa\uffferized along with our case in Table 1 [26\u201332]. The re\ufffeports all describe male patients with a median age of 70\nyears (range 49\u201371 years). Four cases of synchronous\nmetastasis and four cases of metachronous metastasis\nhave been reported. The time between the first treat\ufffement and pharyngeal metastasis was 17\u201358 months in\ncases of metachronous metastasis. Five patients, includ\ufffeing our case, underwent surgery for pharyngeal metasta\ufffeses. The prognosis for all cases except ours was poor;\nfour died within 1 year, two underwent difficult curative\ntreatment, and one experienced multiple recurrences of\npharyngeal metastasis at 1 year after surgery [28\u201332]. Our\nreport is the second to describe solitary recurrence in the\npharyngeal region after liver transplantation and includes\nthe longest surviving case of HCC with pharyngeal\nmetastasis.\nThe mechanism of metastasis to the pharyngeal region\nis controversial, although it has been speculated that there\nare two main pathways: tumor cells may circulate through\nthe vena cava and be distributed to the pharyngeal region\nvia the arterial systemic circulation, or may reach the head\nand neck by bypassing the lungs, possibly through the\nportal\u2013vertebral venous plexus (Batson\u2019s theory) [33]. The\nvertebral venous plexus consists of the internal vertebral\nvenous system distributed around the spinal canal, the ex\ufffeternal vertebral venous plexus distributed in front of the\nvertebral body, and the vertebral vein that anastomoses\nboth of those sites. This plexus communicates with the\nintercostal vein and the azygos vein in each site. In the\nhead and neck region, the plexus communicates with the\npterygium venous plexus, cavernous venous plexus, and\npharyngeal venous plexus around the nasal and paranasal\nFig. 3 Clinical course of patient with pharyngeal metastasis after living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\nTacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil were used as posttransplant immunosuppressive agents, with no steroid administration. Epirubicin was\nadministered during surgery. Pharyngeal metastasis occurred at 1 year and 10 months after LDLT. In addition, at 2 years after pharyngeal\npolypectomy, recurrence of HCC was detected in the regional neck lymph nodes. Recurrence subsequently occurred three times in the grafted\nliver, and local treatment with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and radiofrequency ablation therapy were performed. The patient took\nTS-1 orally after pharyngeal polypectomy for approximately 1 year and 6 months, and oral administration of sorafenib was started after the\nsecond liver graft recurrence\nTohyama et al. World Journal of Surgical Oncology (2020) 18:109 Page 4 of 8\n\nsinuses [34]. As there is no venous valve in the vertebral\nvein, the blood is thought to easily flow backward when\nthe intrathoracic pressure or abdominal pressure rises\n[33]. HCC metastasis through the portal vein is considered\nto be common, such that tumor cells that have entered\nthe vertebral vein plexus from the portal vein flow back\nto the pharyngeal venous plexus due to an increase of\nintraperitoneal pressure, and metastasize to the phar\ufffeynx [33\u201335]. In this case, metastasis first occurred as a\npharyngeal polyp, and recurrence occurred in the regional\nlymph node on the same side 2 years later. During this\ntime, metastasis to other organs, including the lungs, did\nnot occur; thus, it was strongly suspected that it had\nspread to the pharynx via the vertebral vein plexus of\nBaston. In 2005, Oida et al. reviewed 10 cases of HCC\nwith pharyngeal metastasis (non-English articles included)\n[28]. In addition, Hou et al. reported 30 cases of HCC me\ufffetastasis in the gingival region [36]. Collectively, these cases\nimply that oral cavity and nasopharyngeal metastasis via\nthe portal-vertebral venous plexus represent a primary\nHCC metastatic pathway.\nThe Milan criteria are based on the size and number\nof HCCs. In addition to tumor size and number, the\ngrade of histological differentiation, microvascular inva\ufffesion, and underestimation of HCC burden based on\npreoperative imaging are reported to be associated with\nrecurrence [2, 4, 37, 38]. Furthermore, there is an in\ufffecreased desire for further information on tumor biology\nand surrogates of tumor biology when determining\ntransplant suitability. Consequently, some transplant\ufffeation centers include tumor markers in their patient\nevaluations, such as AFP and DCP, the levels of which\nare correlated with HCC recurrence rate [2, 20, 39]. The\nHCC response to pretransplant locoregional therapy is\nan important surrogate marker for survival, as well as an\nindicator of tumor biology. Some authors reported that\nthe 5-year overall survival rate and recurrence rate were\nsignificantly associated with pretransplant treatment for\nHCC [40, 41]. In this case, pretransplant TACE for HCC\nresulted in a partial response, small multiple well\ufffedifferentiated HCCs that appeared to represent multi\ufffecentric occurrence were observed during pathological\nexamination, and the DCP level was high preoperatively.\nTherefore, this case fell within the Milan criteria based\non preoperative imaging, but the risk of recurrence was\nconsidered high.\nEven if the vertebral vein system develops as a collateral\npathway, this does not manifest in any specific symptom,\nand its recognition as a transportal-vertebral metastatic\npathway remains poor. In addition, metastasis in\npharyngeal regions is difficult to detect because such re\ufffegions represent the border between the head and chest on\nCT examinations. Metastasis in pharyngeal regions may be\nmissed by common follow-up imaging procedures, such as\nUS and CT, such that recurrence may be discovered only\nafter metastasis to other sites. Early detection is the only\nfactor associated with effective treatment after recurrence.\nCareful follow-up involving the analysis of tumor markers\nand imaging analysis of frequent metastatic recurrence\nsites, including the pharyngeal and cervical regions, are im\ufffeportant, especially in high-risk patients.\nOver the last decade, we have significantly improved\nour understanding of the molecular landscape of HCC\n[42]. Numerous studies have investigated the utility of\nmolecular biomarkers, such as DNA alterations, to pre\ufffedict outcomes in patients following liver transplantation\nTable 1 Characteristics of patients with pharyngeal metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma\nCase Author, year\n(reference)\nAge Sex Treatment for\nprimary HCC\nMaximum\nsize of\nprimary\nHCC (cm)\nNumber\nof\nprimary\nHCC\nHistopathology\nof primary HCC\nInterval from\nprimary HCC\nto pharyngeal\nmetastasis\nTreatment\nfor\nmetastasis\nOutcome\n1 Ciriza,1996 [26] 71 M None 2.4 1 Unknown 3 years Operation Died after 8 months\n2 Llanes, 1996 [27] 71 M None 8 1 Unknown Synchronous Operation Died after 10 months\n3 Oida, 2005 [28] 59 M Hepatectomy 3 1 Moderate Synchronous Operation\nand radiation\nDied after 8 months\n4 Nagano, 2008 [29] 73 M Hepatectomy,\nTAE, RFA\n3 1 Unknown 4 years 10 months Operation Alive for 1 year with\nmultiple instances of\nrecurrence in the\nremnant liver\n5 Kattepur, 2014 [30] 70 M None 1.9 1 Unknown Synchronous None \u2013\n6 Guo, 2015 [31] 50 M TAE Large,\ndiffuse\n1 Unknown Synchronous Radiation \u2013\n7 Lou, 2019 [32] 45 M Liver\ntransplantation\n4 1 Unknown 1 year\n5 months\nRadiation Died after 3 months\n8 Present case 49 M Liver\ntransplantation\n2.4 Multiple Well\u2013moderate 1 year\n10 months\nOperation Alive for 12 years\n10 months\nHCC hepatocellular carcinoma, M male, TAE transarterial embolization, RFA radiofrequency ablation therapy\nTohyama et al.

Some authors have reported that miRNA\nmarkers were useful predictors of HCC recurrence after\nliver transplantation [42, 45\u201347]. In the near future, it is\nexpected that the understanding of tumor biology will\nadvance through further analysis of these molecular\nmechanisms, facilitating individual risk stratification\nfor HCC patients who will benefit from liver\ntransplantation [42].\nThe concept of oligorecurrence, introduced by Hellman\nand Weichselbaum in 1995, suggests that survival is im\ufffeproved by aggressive local treatment depending on the\nnumber and location of recurrent tumors [48]. Extrahepatic\nrecurrence of HCC often occurs at local sites after liver\nresection, and survival can be prolonged by surgical resec\ufffetion in such cases [49, 50]. Even after liver transplantation,\nprolongation of survival can be expected if radical resection\nis performed for local recurrence [4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13].\nAlthough there are no strict surgical indications for HCC\nrecurrence after liver transplantation, the recurrence time\nfollowing liver transplantation is 12\u201324 months or more;\nthe prognosis of surgery for recurrence is good [4, 10, 13].\nOther prognostic factors have been revealed, such as an\nAFP level of 100 ng/ml or greater, bone metastasis,\nthree or more tumors, and tumor size at the time of\nrecurrence [8, 10, 11, 13]. About 10\u201323% of patients\nwith recurrence survive for a long time after surgical\ntherapy [6, 8, 51]. The median survival of unresect\ufffeable cases was reported to be 5\u201315 months, while that\nof resectable cases with local recurrence was reported\nto be 28\u201365 months; cases of long-term survival after\nresection of the grafted liver, lung, and adrenal metas\ufffetasis have also been reported [52\u201355].\nThe factor responsible for the favorable clinical\ncourse in our case is thought to be that surgery could\nbe performed easily to treat pharyngeal recurrence be\ufffecause of the pedunculated polyp-like shape at the site\nof recurrence, and radical resection of subsequent\nlymph node recurrence was possible. In addition, we\nused a steroid-free postoperative immunosuppressant\nregimen. After recurrence of HCC, TS-1 and sorafenib\nwere used as antitumor agents. Several studies have\nindicated that immunosuppressant therapy including\nsteroid can impact HCC recurrence after liver trans\ufffeplantation [56]. The mammalian target of rapamycin\n(mTOR) inhibitors sirolimus and everolimus have been\nreported to be effective as immunosuppressants after\nliver transplantation for HCC [57, 58]. However, data\non the utility of mTOR inhibitors for treating HCC re\ufffecurrence after liver transplantation remain scarce [48].\nRecently, new anticancer and molecular targeted drugs,\nsuch as sorafenib, regorafenib, lenvatinib, ramucirumab,\nand nivolumab, have been clinically applied to treat HCC.\nThe efficacy of these drugs for treating recurrence after\nliver transplantation for HCC has been studied; several re\ufffeports indicated prolongation of survival, but there is no\nestablished therapeutic regimen and there is some concern\nregarding adverse effects on liver function [59\u201362]. Clinical\ntrials of chemotherapy for patients with HCC recurrence\nand/or postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for patients\nat high risk of recurrence after liver transplantation are\nrequired [63].\nConclusion\nIn summary, we have reported a rare case of pharyngeal\nmetastasis following LDLT for HCC. The cervical region\nmust be recognized as a primary site of extrahepatic metas\ufffetasis of HCC via the portal\u2013vertebral venous plexus. Even\nwith recurrence in the pharyngeal region, patients can\nachieve long-term survival, as in the present case. Early\ndiagnosis of recurrence via careful periodic follow-up exam\ufffeinations of the cervical to nasopharyngeal region, together\nwith frequent sites of metastatic recurrence such as the\nlungs, grafted liver, adrenal glands, bone, and abdominal\nlymph nodes, is required. At present, there is no established\nimmunotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy after liver trans\ufffeplantation that suppresses HCC recurrence. In addition, the\neffectiveness of surgical treatment for the oligo-recurrence\nof HCC after liver transplantation has been reported,\nbut there is no effective treatment for multiple recur\uffferences. Multidisciplinary treatment with radical resec\ufffetion and various subsequent treatments, including\nimmunosuppressive treatment and anti-tumor therapy,\nare also needed according to the patient\u2019s condition.\nAbbreviations\nHCC: Hepatocellular carcinoma; LDLT: Living-donor liver transplantation;\nMELD: Model End-stage Liver Disease; HBV: Hepatitis B virus; CT: Computed\ntomography; AFP: \u03b1-Fetoprotein; DCP: Des-\u0264-carboxy prothrombin;\nMMF: Mycophenolate mofetil; US: Abdominal ultrasonography;\nFDG: Fluorodeoxyglucose; PET: Positron emission tomography; TS-1: Tegafur/\ngimeracil/oteracil; mTOR: Mammalian target of rapamycin\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Dr. Toshiki Maetani for initial treatment of\npharyngeal metastases.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions\nTT designed and wrote this manuscript.

The authors discuss the rarity of pharyngeal metastasis from HCC and summarize previous reports of such cases. They also highlight the controversy surrounding the mechanisms of metastasis to the pharyngeal region, which may involve either the vena cava or the vertebral venous plexus (Batson's theory). The authors suggest that close monitoring and prompt intervention, such as surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy, are essential for managing pharyngeal metastasis from HCC. Additionally, they emphasize the importance of identifying new systemic treatments, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, for advanced HCC. Overall, the authors call for further investigation into the mechanisms underlying pharyngeal metastasis from HCC and the development of more effective treatment options for this condition.",

It is a unique and particularly challenging cancer\nto treat because the dual forces of malignancy and underlying\nliver disease must be simultaneously managed. This review\nwill outline current perspectives on epidemiological trends\nand risk factors for HCC; the roles of screening/surveillance,\ndiagnostic, and treatment strategies; and the importance of\nadopting a multidisciplinary approach to HCC management.\nEpidemiology and Risk Factors of HCC\nHepatocellular carcinoma is the third most common cause of\ncancer death worldwide,1 accounting for \u0001 695,900 deaths\nyearly.2 Although the highest incidence of HCC is in Southeast\nand East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, current epidemiologic\ntrends show that the incidence of HCC in the United States is\nrising.3 Age-adjusted incidence rates from the Surveillance,\nEpidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry show that the\nincidence of HCC has tripled between 1975 and 20053; the\nAmerican Cancer Society estimated 28,720 new cases of HCC\nand 20,550 HCC-related deaths in the United States in 2012.4\nThe incidence and associated mortality of HCC varies based on\nethnicity and age. Asians/Pacific Islanders show the highest\nincidence followed by Hispanics, Blacks, American Indians/\nAlaskan natives, and Whites. Among age groups, the highest\nincrease in rates of HCC are found in men aged 50 to 59 years\nand 70 to 84 years.3\nUnderstanding the etiology and risk factors for HCC is\nimportant in appreciating global HCC trends and instituting\nappropriate prevention or screening approaches.

Improved understanding\nof risk factors for HCC has allowed the development of more effective prevention and\nsurveillance strategies to reduce the global burden of this malignancy. Because of the\ncomplex nature of HCC, arising in a background of chronic liver dysfunction and often\nassociated with viral infection, appropriate treatment requires a multidisciplinary\napproach designed to control the cancer and treat the underlying liver disease.\nTreatment approaches vary based on disease stage and severity, making accurate\ndiagnosis and staging of disease critical. This has been aided by the development of new\nstaging criteria, such as the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Staging System. For earlier\ufffestage disease, resection, radiofrequency ablation, transplantation, and transarterial\nchemoembolization (TACE) are preferred treatment modalities that provide optimal\noutcome. Until recently, few treatment options existed for patients with more advanced\ndisease. Improved understanding of the underlying biology of the disease and the\ndevelopment of molecularly targeted therapies, including the multitargeted angioki\ufffenase inhibitor sorafenib, has improved outcomes in this patient population. Research\ninto therapeutic targets and novel agents continues for more advanced disease.\nIssue Theme Enhancing Clinical\nOutcomes in Hepatocellular Carcinoma;\nGuest Editor, Ghassan Abou-Alfa, MD\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 by Thieme Medical\nPublishers, Inc., 333 Seventh Avenue,\nNew York, NY 10001, USA.\nTel: +1(212) 584-4662.\nDOI http://dx.doi.org/\n10.1055/s-0033-1333631.\nISSN 0272-8087.\nS3\n\nincidence of HCC in China and Africa reflects the elevated\nprevalence of chronic HBV infection.2,5 However, HCC in the\nUnited States, Western Europe, and Japan more commonly\narises in the context of liver injury due to chronic hepatitis C\nvirus (HCV).3,6 Other important risk factors implicated in the\netiology of HCC include aflatoxin B1 exposure, alcoholic\ncirrhosis, diabetes, obesity, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis\n(NASH). The risk of HCC was found to significantly increase\nwith an alcohol exposure of > 80 g ethanol per day compared\nwith no exposure, and was elevated 54-fold in the presence of\nboth viral infection and alcohol exposure.7,8 Patients with\ndiabetes had a significantly higher incidence rate (2.39 vs 0.87\nper 10,000 person-years, respectively, p < 0.0001) compared\nwith patients without diabetes in a study of 824,263\npatients.9 In a large prospective study, a high body mass\nindex (BMI) of 35.0\u201339.9 was associated with a 4.5-fold\nincreased risk of HCC.10 Moreover, synergistic interaction\namong alcohol exposure, diabetes, and obesity might further\nincrease the risk of HCC.8 The relationship between tobacco\nuse and risk of HCC is presently unclear; however, a case\ufffecontrolled study demonstrated a fivefold increase in the risk\nof HCC after an exposure of 20 pack-years.11\nGiven that chronic HBV and HCV infections are the major\nrisk factors for HCC, prevention of these infections would have\na huge impact on the worldwide incidence of HCC. Rigorous\nHBV vaccination measures have been highly successful in\npreventing both neonatally acquired HBV and adult HBV\ninfections and consequently, in reducing the risk of HCC.12\nIn addition to vaccinations, some evidence indicates that\nantiviral therapies may play an important role in preventing\ncomplications from chronic HBV infection and progression to\nHCC. In a placebo-controlled study of 651 patients with\nchronic HBV infection, antiviral therapy with lamivudine\nreduced the incidence of HCC by 51% compared with placebo\n(3.9% vs 7.4%; hazard ratio [HR] \u00bc 0.49; p \u00bc 0.047).13 In the\ncase of HCV, where no vaccine is available, preventative\nstrategies include disrupting transmission through good\nclinical practices, reducing high-risk behaviors through pub\ufffelic education, and managing chronic infections with com\ufffebined antiviral therapy including novel agents such as\nboceprevir or telapravir.14 Other, modifiable risk factors,\nsuch as alcohol use, diabetes, obesity, and smoking, will likely\nget more attention once preventative strategies against viral\nhepatitis are well implemented.\nPrior to discussing diagnostic and treatment approaches\nfor HCC, the implications of the heterogeneity of HCC and\nunderlying liver disease must be underscored. Although it is\nknown that up to 70% of HCC develops in the setting of chronic\nliver disease,15,16 the molecular evolution of HCC is a com\ufffeplex, multistep process that is still not completely under\ufffestood. However, two major mechanisms seem to be the most\nimportant: the development of liver cirrhosis and the alter\ufffeation of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes leading to\naberrant cell signaling pathways. Targeting these signaling\npathways represents a rationale for modern systemic therapy\nof HCC and is discussed later in this supplement.\nDue to the complex nature of HCC and its association with\nliver dysfunction, the management of this malignancy re\ufffequires close collaboration among a multidisciplinary team of\nhepatologists/gastroenterologists, pathologists, radiologists,\nsurgeons, and oncologists. Timely selection of a therapeutic\nintervention and referral to the appropriate specialist within\nthe multidisciplinary team is critical to deliver optimal\npatient care in this disease.\nSurveillance and Diagnosis\nScreening and surveillance are highly important for early\ndetection of HCC in patients considered to be at risk, such as\nAsian HBV carriers, Blacks with hepatitis B, HBV carriers with\nfamily history of HCC, patients with cirrhosis and chronic HBV\nor HCV, genetic susceptibility (hemochromatosis, \u03b1 1-anti\ufffetrypsin deficiency), or cirrhosis of other etiology.17\nHepatologists/gastroenterologists at the forefront of man\ufffeaging patients with chronic liver diseases play a critical role in\nthe implementation of surveillance programs. The combina\ufffetion of ultrasound and \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP) evaluation has been\nshown to reduce mortality by 37% in patients with HBV,18\nsupporting the need for HCC surveillance. However, in a pooled\nanalysis in patients with early HCC, ultrasound was shown to\nhave only 63% sensitivity.19 Cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit\nanalyses have indicated that the surveillance strategy of ultra\ufffesound and AFP appears to be the best,20,21 and a recent\nprospective study showed that ultrasound and AFP are com\ufffeplementary, with a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 83%.22\nThe practice guidelines of the American Association for Liver\nDiseases (AASLD) recommend ultrasound alone at 6-month\nintervals for HCC surveillance,17 but the National Comprehen\ufffesive Cancer Network (NCCN) and other societies recommend\nthe combination of ultrasound and AFP.23 There is a need to\nidentify novel biomarkers, either alone or to complement\nultrasonography, to improve the performance characteristics\nfor the detection of early HCC.\nWhen suspicious nodules are identified, the current diag\ufffenostic algorithm (\u25baFig. 1) proposed by the AASLD recom\ufffemends that liver nodules < 1 cm be observed with\nultrasound every 3 months until stability or growth of the\nlesion is established.17 For lesions > 1 cm, characteristic\nintense arterial uptake followed by contrast washout in the\nvenous-delayed phases should be detected with 4-phase\nmultidetector computer tomography (MDCT) or dynamic\ncontrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nWith the improved accuracy and sensitivity of imaging\nmodalities, liver biopsy is currently not indicated for the\ndiagnosis of HCC in a cirrhotic liver, and is even considered\ncontroversial. Although specificity of liver biopsy is almost\n100%, sensitivity varies and depends on the tumor size and\nlocation and the size of the needle used for biopsy. Addition\ufffeally, there is a small risk (2.7%) of tumor seeding after liver\nbiopsy.24 According to the AASLD guidelines, biopsy is war\uffferanted only in instances where neither MDCT nor MRI shows\ncharacteristics of HCC, and is most useful in hypovascular\ntumors and in small nodules < 1 cm.17 Histologic confirma\ufffetion of HCC requires positive results for at least two of the\nfollowing three immunostains: glypican 3, heat shock protein\n70, and glutamine synthetase.25\nSeminars in Liver Disease Vol. 33 Suppl. 1/2013\nS4 Multidisciplinary Management of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Marrero\n\nStaging and Outcome of HCC\nPrognosis and treatment options for HCC are dependent not\nonly on the tumor stage, but also on the magnitude of liver\nimpairment; therefore, conventional staging systems used in\nthe majority of other cancers, such as the tumor-node\ufffemetastasis (TNM) staging system, are insufficient. Several\nHCC staging systems incorporating liver function, such as the\nOkuda classification,26 Cancer of the Liver Italian Program\n(CLIP),27,28 Chinese University Prognostic Index (CUPI),29 and\nJapanese Integrated System (JIS),30 have been developed;\nhowever, they do not adequately stratify patients across the\ncontinuum of HCC and fail to provide treatment guidance or\nprognostic accuracy.31,32 In contrast, the Barcelona Clinic\nLiver Cancer (BCLC) Staging System (\u25baFig. 2) stratifies pa\ufffetients based on tumor stage, performance status, cancer\uffferelated symptoms, and liver function status as assessed by\nthe Child-Pugh score to provide specific treatment recom\ufffemendations that can be correlated with life expectancy.33\u201336\nThe Child-Pugh score uses five clinical measures of liver\nfunction (total bilirubin, serum albumin, ascites, hepatic\nencephalopathy, and prothrombin international normalized\nratio [PT INR]) to categorize patients into Child-Pugh class\nA\u2013C, which correlate with the severity of liver disease.36 The\nBCLC Staging System is currently a preferred staging system\nfor HCC, and is endorsed by both the American and European\nMedical Associations.17,37\u201339\nAccording to BCLC staging, very early-stage HCC includes\npatients with solitary, vaguely nodular tumors < 2 cm, pre\ufffeserved liver function (Child-Pugh A), and no vascular or\ndistant metastasis. Although these patients have the best\nprognosis, very early-stage HCC is difficult to diagnose.\nEarly-stage disease includes patients with either solitary\ntumors < 5 cm or up to three nodules < 3 cm in size, no\nvascular invasion or extrahepatic dissemination (constituting\nthe Milan criteria for liver transplantation), and Child-Pugh A\nor B liver function. Several curative treatment modalities are\napplicable in this patient subset, yielding a 5-year survival of\n50\u201375%. The intermediate stage includes patients with large\nmultinodular tumors beyond the Milan criteria, Child-Pugh A\nor B liver disease, and no vascular tumor invasion or extrahe\ufffepatic spread; these patients have an average predicted 3-year\nsurvival of \u0001 29% with current therapies.

End-stage disease includes\npatients exhibiting cancer symptoms and decompensated\nliver function (Child\u2013Pugh C); the median survival of this\npatient subset is < 3 months.33\nCurrent Treatment Modalities for HCC\nThe treatment strategy for a patient with HCC is selected\nbased on cancer stage, patient performance status, and\nunderlying liver disease, and includes radical surgery (resec\ufffetion or transplantation), locoregional therapy (radiofre\ufffequency ablation [RFA], transarterial chemoembolization\n[TACE], or embolization), systemic therapy (sorafenib), or a\ncombination of these strategies.\nEarly-Stage HCC\nTreatment options for patients with early-stage HCC are largely\ndictated by the severity of liver dysfunction, portal hyperten\ufffesion (defined as a hepatic venous pressure gradient > 10 mm\nHg), and presence of comorbidities. Surgical resection is the\nstandard of care for patients with very early-stage or early\ufffestage HCC with well-preserved liver function (no cirrhosis or\nChild-Pugh A), normal bilirubin (< 1 mg/dL), and no portal\nhypertension.17 In patients with portal hypertension and\nelevated bilirubin ( 1 mg/dL), a high risk of irreversible\npostoperative clinical decompensation and a reduced survival\nof 25% have been observed that preclude the use of surgical\nresection in this subset of patients.40 Unfortunately, early\ufffephase and late-phase intrahepatic recurrences have been\nreported after surgical resection, with 5-year recurrence rates\nexceeding 70%.41\u201343 Although predictors of recurrence have\nnot been completely defined, there is some evidence to suggest\nthat microvascular invasion and serum AFP  32 ng/mL might\nbe strong predictive factors for postoperative early recurrence\n(< 2 years), although grade of hepatitis activity, tumor nodule\nmultiplicity, and gross tumor classification may predict late\nrecurrence ( 2 years).42\u201346 Some evidence indicates that\nadjuvant therapy with interferon may reduce the risk of\nrecurrence; however, further validation is required before its\nrole can be established in this setting.47,48 Salvage transplan\ufffetation may be indicated for selected previously resected pa\ufffetients such as those with recurrences due to de novo\noncogenesis or those who show pathological evidence of\nvascular invasion prior to proven recurrence.49,50\nLiver transplantation offers the best survival benefit for\npatients with early-stage disease by reducing the potential for\nrecurrence through the elimination of undetectable liver\nlesions and underlying liver disease. The above-mentioned\nMilan criteria are globally used to select patients for liver\ntransplantation; patients receiving a transplant according to\nthis criteria have a 4-year overall survival (OS) of 75% and only\nan 8% risk of recurrence.51 To expand listing criteria for\npatients with HCC, the University of San Francisco (UCSF)\ndeveloped modified criteria in which patients with a solitary\nlesion of \u0004 6.5 cm in diameter or \u0004 3 lesions \u0004 4.5 cm with a\ntotal combined diameter of \u0004 8 cm are eligible for trans\ufffeplant.52 However, the UCSF criteria have not been formally\nadopted by United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) due to\nthe scarcity of donor livers. The UNOS primarily uses the\nModel for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) criteria, a compos\ufffeite score of liver function parameters that assesses the risk of\nlife-threatening liver failure, to allocate available livers for\ntransplantation. Because MELD does not consider mortality\nrisk from HCC, additional points are given for presence of HCC\nto prioritize for transplantation. The long waiting time\nbetween listing and transplantation has also led to strategies\nfor increasing the donor pool, such as using living donors and\nsplit liver transplantation.17,53 In addition, withdrawal from\nthe waiting list due to disease progression might be reduced\nby use of a locoregional \u201cbridge therapy,\u201d such as TACE or\nablation.54\u201357 There is evidence that response to preoperative\nTACE to \u201cdownstage\u201d HCC led to better long-term survival\nfollowing transplantation, particularly in patients that fit the\nMilan criteria.58,59 Importantly, the number of donors avail\ufffeable for liver transplant has plateaued over the past 10 years\nto \u0001 1500/year for patients with HCC,60 while the number of\npatients with HCC has grown significantly to over 28,000.4\nTherefore, liver transplantation as a treatment for HCC is\nlimited in its scope.\nFor patients who are unsuitable for surgical resection or\nliver transplantation, locoregional therapy using image\ufffeguided percutaneous tumor ablation methods is the treat\ufffement of choice. RFA has demonstrated a superior survival\nbenefit compared with percutaneous ethanol injection in\npatients with early-stage HCC, particularly those with com\ufffepensated liver disease (Child-Pugh A).61 Radiofrequency\nablation was associated with a 5-year OS of 76% when\nused as frontline therapy in patients with resectable HCC\nby BCLC criteria, which is comparable to the survival rates\nachieved historically with surgical resection.62,63 Two pro\ufffespective randomized trials demonstrated that RFA was as\neffective as surgical resection in terms of OS or recurrence\ufffefree survival while being less invasive and having fewer\ncomplications.64,65 These results question the use of surgi\ufffecal resection as standard first-line therapy in all patients\nwith very early-stage HCC, and support consideration of RFA\nin this setting. However, RFA has several limitations and\nshowed suboptimal results in patients with tumor\nsize > 3 cm and perivascularly located tumors.66 To over\ufffecome these limitations, numerous refinements of ablation\nmethods are under clinical testing, including laser ablation,\nmicrowave ablation, cryoablation light-activated therapy,\nand irreversible electroporation.\nIntermediate-Stage HCC\nPatients with large multimodal tumors, preserved liver func\ufffetion, and no vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread who are\nineligible for radical surgical therapies or percutaneous abla\ufffetion are usually treated with TACE.17 Transarterial chemo\ufffeembolization involves the intra-arterial injection of a\ncytotoxic agent (doxorubicin, cisplatin, or mitomycin), with\nor without lipiodol, plus an embolic agent into the hepatic\nartery that supplies the tumor. In a meta-analysis of seven\nstudies, TACE demonstrated a significant improvement in\n2-year survival (odds ratio \u00bc 0.53; p \u00bc 0.017) compared with\nbest supportive care.67 However, patient selection appears to\nSeminars in Liver Disease Vol. 33 Suppl. 1/2013\nS6 Multidisciplinary Management of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Marrero\n\nbe critical for achieving a survival advantage with this meth\ufffeod. In the positive Barcelona study, a 2-year OS of 63% and\nobjective responses of 35% were reported for patients treated\nwith TACE, but 70% of them had compensated liver disease\n(Child-Pugh A) with no vascular invasion or extrahepatic\nspread.68 Another study found that among patients treated\nwith TACE, those with unilobular portal vein invasion and\ntumors > 5 cm did not show a survival benefit.69 In both of\nthese studies, the long-term outcomes were unsatisfactory\nwith a 3-year OS of only \u0001 30%, highlighting the need for\nimproved strategies to optimize outcomes.\nTo further improve outcomes and tolerability of TACE, a\nnew drug delivery system has been developed using doxoru\ufffebicin-eluting beads (DEB), which provides embolization and\nreleases the cytotoxic agent in a controlled fashion\n(DEB-TACE).70 Encouraging tolerability and response rates\nof 70\u201385% have been reported with this technique.71\u201374\nHowever, in the recently reported, prospective, randomized\nphase II PRECISION V trial of 212 patients with intermediate\ufffestage HCC, though DEB-TACE substantially reduced hepatic\nand doxorubicin-related systemic side effects compared with\nthose found with conventional TACE, clear superiority in\nresponse rates was not demonstrated (52% vs 44%;\np \u00bc 0.11).75 Clearly, further studies are warranted to define\nthe role of DEB-TACE in HCC. In addition to TACE, radio\ufffeembolization with yttrium-90 (90Y) microspheres represents\na potential new treatment option for patients with Child\ufffePugh A cirrhosis and intermediate-stage HCC, but needs to be\nexplored in randomized trials.76\nUnresectable/Advanced-Stage HCC\nTreatment options are limited for patients with unresectable\nadvanced stage HCC or those for whom therapy with TACE has\nfailed. Systemic chemotherapy, either single agent or in\ncombination, demonstrated only minor antitumor activity\n(response rate < 30%) and failed to show an unequivocal\nimprovement in OS.77\u201379 However, recent evidence that\nchemotherapy might have a role in HCC has emerged from\nan Asian phase III study where the FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin/5-\nfluorouracil/leucovorin) chemotherapy regimen improved\nresponse rate, time to progression (TTP), and OS in patients\nwith advanced stage HCC when compared with doxorubicin,\nbut these results require further validation.80\nBetter understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of\nHCC has led to recognition of the importance of angiogenesis\nfor tumor development, growth, and progression, thus mak\ufffeing angiogenesis an attractive target. Proangiogenic factors,\nsuch as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet\nderived growth factor (PDGF) and their receptors, have been\nshown to have important roles in facilitating HCC angiogene\ufffesis. Sorafenib, a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that\nblocks several key modulators of angiogenesis, including\nVEGFR2, PDGFR, Raf-1 and B-Raf receptors, is the first drug\nto show a survival benefit in patients with advanced HCC and\nrepresents a paradigm shift in the systemic treatment of this\ndisease. Its efficacy was proven in two large, randomized,\nplacebo-controlled clinical trials, which mainly included\npatients with advanced HCC and Child-Pugh A liver dis\ufffeease.81,82 In the Sorafenib HCC Assessment Randomized\nProtocol (SHARP) study of 602 patients, most of whom\nwere Caucasian, treatment with 400 mg sorafenib twice daily\nsignificantly prolonged TTP (5.5 months vs 2.8 months;\nHR \u00bc 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45\u20130.74;\np < 0.001) and median OS (10.7 months vs 7.9 months,\nHR \u00bc 0.69; 95% CI 0.55\u20130.87; p < 0.001). In a similarly de\ufffesigned Asia-Pacific study of 271 Asian patients, sorafenib\ntherapy prolonged TTP (2.8 months vs 1.4 months; HR\n\u00bc 0.57; 95% CI 0.42\u20130.72; p \u00bc 0.0005) and median OS (6.5\nmonths vs 4.2 months; HR \u00bc 0.68; 95% CI 0.50\u20130.93;\np \u00bc 0.014) compared with placebo. The inferior magnitude\nof benefit of the Asia-Pacific study compared with the SHARP\nstudy may be partly attributable to differences in patient\ncharacteristics, disease heterogeneity, and etiopathology\nbetween the trials. Seventy-five percent of patients in the\nAsia-Pacific study exhibited hepatitis B etiology, compared\nwith only 19% in the SHARP study. In addition, patients\nenrolled in the Asia-Pacific study had a worse performance\nstatus and more advanced stage disease in general than those\nin the SHARP study. In both trials, hand-and-foot skin reac\ufffetion, diarrhea, rash, and fatigue were among the most com\ufffemonly reported adverse effects.\nIn both of these studies of sorafenib in the treatment of HCC,\nthe improvements in OS and TTP were not accompanied by\nbenefit in terms of objective response, highlighting the lack of\nutility of conventional RECIST criteria for evaluation of tumor\nresponse to molecular targeted therapy. Recently developed\nmodified RECIST (mRECIST) criteria propose the assessment of\nresponse to molecular targeted therapy (or locoregional ther\ufffeapy) in patients with HCC based on measurement of viable\ntumor with arterial enhancement on a computed tomography\nscan, not anatomical tumor response.83 Although the mRECIST\nis utilized in the assessment of response in systemic therapies,\nit needs further validation. When response to sorafenib was\nassessed according to both mRECIST and conventional RECIST\ncriteria in patients with advanced HCC, a higher rate of objec\ufffetive responses was identified with mRECIST (23% vs 2%), and\npatients who achieved a response according to mRECIST had a\nlonger OS than nonresponding patients (18 months vs\n8 months, p \u00bc 0.013).84\nAlthough it is indisputable that sorafenib represents a\nmajor advancement in the management of unresectable\nadvanced-stage HCC, several unanswered questions and un\ufffemet needs still remain. The clinical benefit with sorafenib\nappears to be modest and short-lived, even in patients with\npreserved liver function. In addition, there is currently no\nreliable predictive biomarker for monitoring response or\nindicating treatment resistance. The registrational trials\nalso did not provide data on the safety and efficacy of\nsorafenib in patients with compromised liver function. How\ufffeever, the postapproval observational GIDEON study (Global\nInvestigation of Therapeutic Decisions in Hepatocellular Car\ufffecinoma and of Its Treatment with Sorafenib) showed that\nsorafenib 400 mg twice daily could be safely prescribed to\nselected Child-Pugh B patients.85 Sorafenib is also being\nexamined in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings in com\ufffebination with locoregional therapies.\nSeminars in Liver Disease Vol. 33 Suppl. 1/2013\nMultidisciplinary Management of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Marrero S7\n\nConclusion\nRecent years have witnessed significant changes in the man\ufffeagement of HCC. Multidisciplinary approaches to manage\ufffement of this disease and diagnostic and treatment algorithms\nthat accommodate the unique aspects of HCC, including its\npathobiology, heterogeneity, and underlying liver im\ufffepairment, have been developed. The introduction of sorafenib\ntherapy has validated the targeted approach to this disease\nand represents a major paradigm shift in the treatment of\nadvanced HCC, leading to the identification of other potential\ntargets and the development of new targeted agents in HCC,\nwhich are discussed in the next article.\nAcknowledgments\nThe author would like to thank Sabitha Muneer, PhD,\nBojana Pajk, MD, MSc, Amy Furedy, RN, OCN, and Chelsey\nGoins, PhD, for their assistance in writing the manuscript,\nand Trudy Grenon Stoddert, ELS, for her editorial assis\ufffetance and assistance preparing the manuscript for publi\ufffecation.

It highlights the limitations of traditional treatments like surgical resection and orthotopic liver transplantation due to advanced liver disease and poor liver function. The article then introduces alternative curative treatments like locoregional therapies, such as percutaneous ablation, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), which offer less invasive alternatives for patients who are not candidates for surgery or liver transplantation. The article emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate treatment modalities based on tumor stage, liver function, and patient characteristics. It also mentions ongoing studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of newer drugs like sorafenib and regorafenib for treating advanced HCC. Overall, the article suggests that a multidisciplinary approach involving specialists in hepatobiliary surgery, interventional radiology, medical oncology, and liver transplantation is necessary for the optimal management of HCC in patients with liver impairment.",

The guideline is\napproved by the British Society of Gastroenter\ufffeology, the British Association for the Study of Liver\nand NHS Blood and Transplant.\nThe first draft was written by Dr P N Newsome\n(senior lecturer and consultant hepatologist, Liver\nUnit, University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foun\ufffedation Trust) in Autumn 2010 with contributions\nfrom the following guideline group: Dr Peter\nHenriksen (consultant cardiologist and honorary\nsenior lecturer, Edinburgh Heart Centre, NHS\nLothian, University Hospitals Division), Professor C\nP Day (Professor of Liver Medicine, Institute of\nCellular Medicine, Newcastle University), Dr D\nThorburn (consultant hepatologist, Liver Unit,\nRoyal Free Hospital, London), Mr D F Mirza\n(consultant hepatobiliary and transplant surgeon,\nLiver Unit, University Hospital Birmingham NHS\nFoundation Trust), Dr J W Ferguson (consultant\nhepatologist and honorary senior lecturer, Liver\nUnit, University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foun\ufffedation Trust), Dr G Auzinger (consultant intensive\ncare medicine, Liver Intensive Therapy Unit, King\u2019s\nCollege Hospital London NHS Foundation Trust),\nDr M Allison (consultant hepatologist, Liver Unit,\nDepartment of Medicine, Cambridge University\nHospital NHS Foundation Trust), Dr J W Tomlinson\n(reader in endocrinology, Centre for Endocri\ufffenology, Diabetes and Metabolism, University of\nBirmingham), H Manley (British Liver Trust), Dr K J\nSimpson (senior lecturer in hepatology, University of\nEdinburgh and honorary consultant physician,\nScottish Liver Transplantation Unit, Royal Infirmary\nEdinburgh), Professor S G Hubscher (Leith Professor\nand Professor of Hepatic Pathology, University of\nBirmingham, and consultant histopathologist,\nUniversity Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation\nTrust), Dr C Millson (consultant hepatologist, St\nJames\u2019s University Hospital, Leeds), Dr J Oben\n(Wellcome Trust senior lecturer and consultant\nhepatologist, University College London, Centre for\nHepatology, Royal Free Hospital, London), Professor\nJ M Neuberger (Associate Medical Director for\nOrgan Donation and Transplantation, NHS Blood\nand Transplant and honorary consultant physician,\nQueen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham), Dr P J\nMcKiernan (consultant paediatrician, Liver Unit,\nBirmingham Children\u2019s Hospital) and Dr J I Wyatt\n(consultant histopathologist, St James\u2019s University\nHospital, Leeds).\nThis followed a systematic review of the litera\ufffeture using retrieval from electronic databases and\nreading suggestions from colleagues. There was also\nsignificant input from the British Liver Trust across\nthe whole document as well as the section on\npatient perspective.\nThe document was revised in the autumn and\nwinter of 2010, principally by Dr P N Newsome and\nDr P A Andrews (Chair, BTS Standards Committee).\nThe last date of literature review was November\n2010. A draft version was circulated to members of\nthe BTS Council and placed on the BTS website for\ncomment in March 2011 (http://www.bts.org.uk/\ntransplantation/standards-and-guidelines/). The final\nversion was revised in the light of comments received\nin April 2011.\nThese guidelines represent consensus opinion\nfrom experts in the UK in the fields of hepatology,\ntransplantation and related disciplines. They\nrepresent a snapshot of the evidence available at the\ntime of writing. It is recognised that recommen\ufffedations are made even when the evidence is weak,\nand indeed much of the evidence quoted is level C\n(consensus opinion) and so this document in many\nparts serves a consensus statement rather than\nclinical guidelines. However, as there is clear\nevidence in many sections and given that this\ndocument has been endorsed by the British Society\nof Gastroenterology, the British Association for the\nStudy of Liver, BTS and UK and Ireland Transplant,\nit is felt the paper states a guideline. Although it is\nbelieved that the information presented is a fair\nsummary of current evidence and best practice,\nneither the authors nor the BTS can be held\nresponsible for any errors or omissions. The guide\ufffelines are not designed to be proscriptive, nor to\ndefine a standard of care. Doses of prescribed drugs\nshould always be checked by the responsible clini\ufffecian according to the relevant information provided\nby the manufacturers of the drugs.\nIt is anticipated that these guidelines will be\nrevised in 2015.\n1\nDepartment of NIHR\nBiomedical Research Unit and\nCentre for Liver Research,\nUniversity of Birmingham,\nBirmingham, UK\n2\nDepartment of Medicine,\nCambridge University Hospital\nNHS Foundation Trust,\nCambridge, UK\n3\nSW Thames Renal and\nTransplantation Unit, London, UK\n4\nInstitute of Liver Studies, King\u2019s\nCollege Hospital, London, UK\n5\nLiver Unit, University of\nNewcastle, Newcastle, UK\n6\nLiver Unit, University Hospital\nBirmingham NHS Foundation\nTrust, Birmingham, UK\n7\nDepartment of Cardiology, Royal\nInfirmary of Edinburgh,\nEdinburgh, UK\n8\nDepartment of Pathology,\nUniversity of Birmingham,\nBirmingham, UK\n9\nBritish Liver Trust, Ringwood, UK\n10Liver Unit, Birmingham\nChildren\u2019s Hospital, Birmingham,\nUK\n11Liver Unit, St James\u2019s\nUniversity Hospital, Leeds, UK\n12NHS Blood and Transplant,\nBristol, UK\n13Centre for Hepatology,\nUniversity College London,\nLondon, UK\n14Department of Hepatology,\nUniversity of Edinburgh,\nEdinburgh, UK\n15Liver Unit, Royal Free Hospital,\nLondon, UK\n16Centre for Endocrinology,\nDiabetes and Metabolism,\nUniversity of Birmingham,\nBirmingham, UK\n17Department of Pathology, St\nJames\u2019s University Hospital,\nLeeds, UK\nCorrespondence to\nDr P N Newsome, Centre for\nLiver Research, NIHR\nBiomedical Research Unit,\nInstitute of Biomedical\nResearch, University of\nBirmingham, Edgbaston,\nBirmingham B15 2TT, UK;\np.n.newsome@bham.ac.uk\nRevised 16 November 2011\nAccepted 1 December 2011\nPublished Online First\n10 January 2012\n484 Gut 2012;61:484e500. doi:10.1136/gutjnl-2011-300886\nGuidelines\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n.

Criteria for diagnosis of NASH group should include an\nestablished clinical and histological diagnosis of NASH on liver\nbiopsy, or a histological diagnosis of cryptogenic cirrhosis with\na clinical phenotype compatible with underlying NASH, as\ndefined by the presence of three or more components of the\nmetabolic syndrome prior to liver transplant (LT). (Level C,\nClass I).\n2. Criteria for consideration of listing for LT in patients with\nNASH cirrhosis either due to end stage liver disease or\npresence of hepatocellular carcinoma should be in line with\nstandard national criteria. (Level C, Class I).\nAssessment of operative risk in NASH patients undergoing liver\ntransplant\n3. Although the diagnosis of NASH cirrhosis should not be\nregarded, in itself, to be a risk factor for poor outcome in the\nperioperative period of LT, cardiovascular risk should be\nclosely considered in patients with NASH as they have more\nrisk factors for cardiovascular disease and are likely to require\nfurther non-invasive testing. (Level C, Class I).\n4. All NASH patients should undergo preoperative risk\nstratification to exclude symptomatic coronary artery\ndisease and assessment for the presence of structural heart\ndisease, left ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary hyper\ufffetension. (Level C, Class I).\n5. Patients unable to achieve four metabolic equivalence of\ntasks (METs), or those with at least one intermediate risk\nfactor should be considered for further cardiac testing. (Level\nC, Class I).\n6. Within a transplant centre, cardiology input should be\nprovided by cardiologists with an interest/experience in the\nassessment of patients with liver disease. (Level C, Class I).\n7. The following moderate risk groups should be discussed early\nwith a cardiologist: (i) patients with chest pain of possible\ncardiac origin; and (ii) patients receiving treatment for\nestablished coronary disease or previous coronary revascular\ufffeisation. (Level C, Class I).\n8. There is insufficient evidence to recommend a single stress test\nfor NASH patients undergoing LTassessment. The choice of test\nwill be in part determined by local expertise. (Level C, Class I).\n9. Patients without refractory ascites should be considered for\na cardioselective b blocker such as bisoprolol prior to LT. This\nshould be titrated gradually and not started in the immediate\nperioperative period. Patients already receiving propanolol or\ncarvedilol for prophylaxis against variceal bleeding should\ncontinue on those non-selective agents. (Level B, Class IIa).\n10. Pravastatin should be considered in patients not already\nreceiving a statin or continued in those patients already\nreceiving it. Ideally, pravastatin should be started at least\n1 week before surgery. Specifically, simvastatin and atorvas\ufffetatin should be avoided in patients undergoing LT due to\ninteractions with calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs). (Level B,\nClass I).\nAssessment and management of nutritional status during\ntransplant work-up\n11. There are no data to support an absolute cut-off for body\nmass index (BMI) and LT although patients with a BMI\n>40 kg/m2 are likely to have an increased postoperative and\nlong term mortality. BMI should be corrected for the presence\nof ascites and peripheral oedema. (Level C, Class IIa).\n12. Weight loss should not be recommended in patients with\ndecompensated end stage liver disease due to the risk of\nprotein calorie malnutrition. (Level C, Class III).\n13. For patients with compensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular\ncarcinoma, it may be appropriate to try and achieve weight\nloss before proceeding/while waiting for a transplant. (Level\nC, Class II).\n14. All potential NASH transplant recipients, including those\nwith an elevated BMI, should be assessed by a dietician and\nsupplemental feeding considered if protein calorie malnutri\ufffetion is present. (Level C, Class I).\n15. Dietary assessment of patients being assessed for LT should\ninclude use of handgrip strength, anthropometry and/or\nsubjective global assessment to objectively define the\npatient\u2019s nutritional status and allow supplementation if\nrequired. (Level B, Class I).\n16. Dietary assessment of patients should be repeated on an\nannual basis while they remain on the waiting list for LT.\n(Level B, Class I).\nSurgical aspects of liver transplantation for patients with NASH\n17. Consider bariatric surgery at the time of LT in recipients\nwith severe morbid obesity, those with failed treatment of\nobesity or in patients with recurrent NASH undergoing\nretransplantation. (Level C, Class IIa)\n18. Consider bariatric surgery in recipients with severe morbid\nobesity, those with failed treatment of obesity or in patients\ndeveloping progressive NASH with fibrosis in the allograft.\n(Level C, Class IIa).\nPerioperative monitoring\n19. While there is likely to be an increased operative risk, the lack\nof evidence from controlled clinical trials indicates that no\nGut 2012;61:484e500. doi:10.1136/gutjnl-2011-300886 485\nGuidelines\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n.

(Level B, Class II).\n20. Moderately tight glucose control (6e10 mmol/l) should be\ntargeted during the early post-transplant course in patients\nof all aetiologies. (Level A, Class II).\n21. If started preoperatively, statin therapy should be continued\nduring the postoperative phase. (Level B, Class I).\nImmunosuppression\n22. Alongside immunosuppression with CNI and antimetabo\ufffelite, consideration should be given to either a steroid free\nregimen or early steroid withdrawal (within 3 months) in\npatients with NASH. Where steroid free regimens are used,\ninduction therapy (such as antithymocyte globulin or\ninterleukin 2 receptor antagonism) should be considered.\n(Level B, Class IIa).\n23. Tacrolimus levels should be 5e8 ng/ml to reduce the impact\non renal function and dyslipidaemia. Mycophenolate should\nbe used as the preferred antimetabolite to permit lower levels\nof tacrolimus. (Level B, Class IIa).\n24. Close follow-up and early recognition and treatment of the\nrecognised consequences of transplantation and immunosup\ufffepression (such as weight gain, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia,\ndiabetes and renal impairment) remain the key to preventing\nexcess risk from recurrent NASH. (Level C, Class I).\nPost-transplant monitoring of NASH patients and disease\nrecurrence\n25. Histological examination of the explanted liver should be\ncarried out to confirm the presence of features compatible\nwith end stage NASH and to exclude features suggesting an\nalternative diagnosis. (Level C, Class I).\n26. The main role of biopsy is to the allow diagnosis and staging\nof liver histopathology. Where NASH is the only or\ndominant pathology, liver allograft biopsies can be scored\nusing the Kleiner classification. Biopsies performed elsewhere\nshould be reviewed at the transplant centre to ensure\nreproducibility. (Level C, Class I).\n27. Post-transplant monitoring of patients should include an\ninitial ultrasound (US) at 1 year, followed by every 2 years,\nlooking for the presence of a fatty liver. (Level C, Class IIa).\n28. Post-transplant monitoring of patients with a fatty liver on\nUS should include protocol liver biopsies to detect disease\nrecurrence, as liver function tests may be normal. Repeat\nbiopsy should be considered every 3 years, unless there is\na clinical indication for more frequent biopsies. (Level C,\nClass IIa).\nPost-transplant management of NASH\n29. Post-transplant patients should receive support, advice and\ntreatment in order achieve a target BMI of <25 kg/m2\n. This\nshould be in the context of a multidisciplinary team,\nincorporating dietary modification, exercise intervention\nand the potential use of pharmacotherapy and surgical\nintervention where appropriate. (Level C, Class I).\n30. Post-transplant patients should be screened for the presence of\ndiabetes and, if present, reviewed regularly for the develop\ufffement of complications. Glycaemic control should be opti\ufffemised in accordance with the National Institute for Health\nand Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance. (Level A, Class I).\n31. Patients transplanted for NASH should be monitored on a 6\nmonthly basis for risk factors for cardiovascular disease\n(blood pressure (BP), lipids, haemoglobin A1c), which should\nbe addressed with the intention of reducing cardiovascular\nevents. (Level C, Class I).\n32. A BP target of 140/90 mm Hg (130/80 mm Hg in patients\nwith diabetes mellitus (DM) and/or renal dysfunction)\nshould be aimed for (Level A, Class I).\n33. Antihypertensive agents such as calcium channel blockers or\nangiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors should be consid\ufffeered in view of their possible additional effects of abrogating\nliver fibrosis. (Level C, Class II).\n34. A target low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of\n<2.6 mmol/l is advised as the 10 year cardiovascular event\nrate exceeds 20% for the liver transplant population.\nPravastatin and ezetimibe are preferred agents in view of\ntheir demonstrated efficacy and absence of interactions\nwith CNIs. (Level C, Class IIa).\nTransplantation for NASHdthe patients\u2019 perspective\n35. There is a need to increase understanding of liver disease and\nits many causes, to improve patient outcomes and to reduce\nthe stigma many patients experience. (Not graded).\n36. The potential cardiovascular morbidity associated with\nNASH should be discussed with patients and guidance\ngiven on diet and exercise, and sources of support (including\npsychological support) as part of ongoing management.\n(Not graded).\n37. Provision of independent pre- and post-transplant emotional\nand psychological counselling and support is very important,\nalong with an opportunity to provide confidential feedback\nto the transplant team post-operatively. (Not graded).\nPREVALENCE OF NASH CIRRHOSIS IN THE UK\nNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a spec\ufffetrum of disease ranging from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis\n(NASH) and cirrhosis. NAFLD is closely associated with obesity\nand represents the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic\nsyndrome. The prevalence of NAFLD has risen rapidly in parallel\nwith the dramatic rise in levels of obesity and DM,2 resulting in\nit now being the commonest cause of liver disease in the West.3\nNAFLD prevalence\nThe prevalence of NAFLD is between 20% and 30% in Western\nadults,4 5 rising to 90% in extreme obesity.6 NAFLD affects 3%\nof the general paediatric population, rising to 53% in obese\nchildren,7 8 with implications for future disease burden. NASH,\nthe more advanced and clinically important form of NAFLD, has\nan estimated prevalence of 2e3% in the general population9 and\n37% in the morbidly obese.6 Steatosis was present in 70% of\na large cohort of patients with type 2 DM.10 The Foresight\nreport predicted that with the alarming growth of obesity, the\nburden of NAFLD on primary care and liver services will double\nfrom a current annual cost of \u00a34.2 billion by 2050.11\nAssociation with increased mortality and progression to liver\ncirrhosis\nPatients with a diagnosis of NAFLD have been shown to have\na significantly higher overall12e16 and liver related13 14 mortality\ncompared with an age and sex matched general population. In\npatients with NASH, the limited data available point to approx\ufffeimately one-third of patients developing progressive fibrosis over\na 5 year period, with up to 9% developing cirrhosis.17 18 The risk\nfactors for progressive NASH related liver disease are obesity, type\n2 DM, insulin resistance and older age. Current evidence suggests\nthat the natural history of NASH cirrhosis is similar to that of\nhepatitis C cirrhosis with respect to decompensation.19 20 Hepa\ufffetocellular carcinoma (HCC), a recognised complication of cirrhosis\n486 Gut 2012;61:484e500. doi:10.1136/gutjnl-2011-300886\nGuidelines\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n.

In the most recent study with\n21 years of follow-up, this corresponded to an excess mortality of\n70% (standardised mortality ratio 1.7; 95% CI 1.24 to 2.25).15\nNeed for liver transplantation\nThe increase in the number of patients with advanced liver\ndisease secondary to NASH, as well as associated HCC, will\nimpact on the potential future demand for LT. Analysis of\nNational Health Service Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) data\nshows that in both 2008 and 2009, 12% of patients placed on the\nelective LT waiting list were categorised as having NASH\ncirrhosis, with 14.8% of these individuals with NASH listed\nwith HCC. Consistent with the known association with insulin\nresistance, 49.1% of patients with NASH cirrhosis listed for LT\nwere diabetic compared with 22.1% of all other registered\npatients (although the criteria for the definition of DM were not\nwell defined).\nINDICATIONS FOR LIVER TRANSPLANTATION IN NASH\nRELATED CIRRHOSIS\nGiven that LT is a relatively recently identified indication for\npatients with NASH, data for long term follow-up are more\nlimited compared with LT for other causes of chronic liver\ndisease. Nevertheless, data from several American centres\nsuggest that patients with NASH do not have an inferior\noutcome 1, 2 and 5 years after LT when compared with other\naetiologies of liver disease.25e27\nThere are no data to suggest that the natural history of\ncirrhosis after an initial clinical decompensation or the rate of\nchange of Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score differ\nfor patients with NASH compared with other causes of\ncirrhosis. Hence the current recommendation should be that\nthere are no disease specific indications for listing for LT in\nthis condition and that those currently useddthat is, MELD\nscore and/or specific variant indications (eg, diuretic resistant/\nintolerant ascites)dshould remain. In those patients with HCC\non the background of NASH related cirrhosis, there are no data\nto support modification of the general criteria for listing for LT.\nMany patients with end stage liver disease have a presumptive\ndiagnosis of NASH. Patients may have a longstanding history or\nDM/hypertension with no other obvious reason for cirrhosis\nother than presumed previous NASH. Generally, when such\npatients present with liver decompensation they do not undergo\nliver biopsy, hence the need for standardisation of diagnosing\nNASH. As such, in the absence of a histological diagnosis of\nNASH, the presence of cirrhosis with a clinical phenotype\ncompatible with underlying NASH, as defined by the presence of\nthree or more components of the metabolic syndrome28 prior to\nLT, is sufficient.\nRecommendation 1: Criteria for diagnosis of NASH should\ninclude an established clinical and histological diagnosis of\nNASH on liver biopsy, or a histological diagnosis of cryptogenic\ncirrhosis with a clinical phenotype compatible with underlying\nNASH, as defined by the presence of three or more components\nof the metabolic syndrome prior to LT. (Level C, Class I).\nRecommendation 2: Criteria for consideration of listing for\nLT in patients with NASH cirrhosis either due to end stage liver\ndisease or the presence of HCC should be in line with standard\nnational criteria. (Level C, Class I).\nIn an era of significant organ shortage, with current mortality\non the elective LTwaiting list being around 18% in the UK, there\nis a duty to allocate organs responsibly. The national guidelines\nfor adult LT are that patients should only be listed for LT if they\nhave a predicted 5 year survival after transplantation of $50%\n(NHSBT Adult Liver Transplantation Guidelines 2009, accessed\n19 February 2011 at http://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/ukt/\nabout _transplants/organ_allocation/liver/national_protocols_\nand_guidelines/adults.jsp). Standard exclusion criteria will apply\nto NASH patients being considered for LT although their strong\nassociation with the metabolic syndrome will likely involve\na more stringent assessment of cardiovascular risk.\nThere is not a large literature on the cost effectiveness of LT.\nLongworth et al compared the disease groups of alcohol, primary\nsclerosing cholangitis and primary biliary cirrhosis.29 They\nreported that the estimated gain in quality adjusted life years\nfrom transplantation was positive for each of the disease groups,\nand the mean incremental cost per quality adjusted life year\n(95% bootstrap confidence intervals) from time of listing to\n27 months for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, alcoholic\nliver disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis are \u00a329 000\n(\u00a31000 to \u00a359 000), \u00a348 000 (\u00a312 000 to \u00a383 000) and \u00a321 000\n(\u0001\u00a323 000 to \u00a360 000), respectively. The higher cost in the\nalcoholic liver disease group was because a greater number of\nsuch patients were assessed for LT but not listed. There are no\ndata looking at the cohort of NASH patients, although it is\nlikely that the costs will be close to those seen in patients with\nalcoholic liver disease given concerns about cardiovascular risk.\nTheir post-transplant outcomes are similar to those of other\naetiologies so it is likely their cost effectiveness will be similar to\nthat seen for indications such as alcoholic liver disease.\nResearch/audit recommendations\n1. It would be helpful to calculate the cost effectiveness of LT\nfor patients with NASH, with particular attention to the\nnumbers needed to assess for each patient placed on the\ntransplant list.\n2. Data on use of marginal donors in this group should be\nrecorded and compared with patients transplanted for other\naetiologies.\nASSESSMENT OF OPERATIVE RISK IN NASH PATIENTS\nUNDERGOING LIVER TRANSPLANTATION\nHaving identified that a patient may benefit from LT, the next\nstage in the process involves an assessment of the risk to the\npatient of proceeding with the operation. The risks can be\ndivided into short (up to 90 days) and long term (1 year\nonwards) to cover the immediate risks of the operation itself and\nthen the longer term survival. In both of these categories there is\nconcern that patients with NASH cirrhosis are at higher risk.\nRisk of cardiovascular events\nCardiovascular risk factors are commonly found in patients\nundergoing LT, with hyperinsulinaemia, type II DM, hyperten\ufffesion, hyperlipidaemia and abdominal obesity disproportionately\npresent in NASH patients.10 30 Myocardial disease and\ndysfunction are common in cirrhotic patients. Indices of\nmyocardial contractility such as left ventricular stroke work are\nGut 2012;61:484e500. doi:10.1136/gutjnl-2011-300886 487\nGuidelines\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n.

The\npresence of pretransplant insulin treated DM has an adverse\nimpact on long term post-transplant survival,34 and many\nindividuals with NASH related cirrhosis have diabetic micro\ufffevascular and macrovascular complications. Indeed, atheroscle\uffferosis has been found to be present in a higher proportion of\npatients with cirrhosis due to NASH compared with cirrhosis of\nother aetiologies.35 Other diabetic complications such as prolif\ufffeerative retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy, cardiovascular auto\ufffenomic neuropathy and diabetic foot ulcer disease have also been\nshown to predict an increased morbidity/mortality in diabetic\ncohorts outside the context of organ transplantation.36e38 A\nfurther area of perceived increased risk relevant to the NASH\ncirrhotic population is that of the effect of obesity on LT\noutcome, which will be covered in the following section.\nWhile there are data which suggest that NASH is an inde\ufffependent risk factor for cardiovascular disease,39 further large\nscale prospective studies are needed to draw firm conclusions\nabout the independent hepatic contribution to the increased\ncardiovascular risk seen in patients with NASH.30 Notably,\nNASH has been reported to independently predict chronic\nkidney disease, which may explain part of the contribution to\ncardiovascular risk.40\nRecommendation 3: Although the diagnosis of NASH\ncirrhosis should not be regarded, in itself, to be a risk factor for\npoor outcome in the perioperative period of LT, cardiovascular\nrisk should be closely considered in patients with NASH as they\nhave more risk factors for cardiovascular disease and are likely to\nrequire further non-invasive testing. (Level C, Class I).\nCardiovascular event rate after liver transplantation\nCardiovascular complications are a common cause of early\nmorbidity and mortality after LT.41 42 Analysis of over 21 000\npatients undergoing LT in the European Liver Transplant\nRegistry reported a 3 month mortality of 12%,43 with 8% of\ndeaths secondary to cardiac and a further 7% secondary to\ncerebrovascular causes. In a study of 413 patients of varying\ncauses of end stage liver disease undergoing LT between 2001\nand 2005, the 30 day all cause mortality was 9%, with 7%\ndeveloping a myocardial infarction (as defined by postoperative\ntroponin elevation) within that time period. A history of\nprevious stroke or coronary disease was associated with a 6.5-\nfold and 4-fold increased risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction\nand death, respectively.44\nPreoperative cardiac risk assessment relies on the presence of\nclinical risk markers, the patient\u2019s functional capacity and the\nextent or risk of the surgical procedure. LT is considered inter\ufffemediate risk surgery compared with higher risk surgical proce\ufffedures, such as aortic surgery, in European and American\nguidelines for preoperative cardiac risk assessment.45 46\nHowever, the 1e5% 30 day risk of myocardial infarction and\ncardiac death quoted for intermediate risk surgery in these\nguidelines45 is less than the rate of cardiovascular complications\nobserved in many LT series47e49 suggesting that LT surgery\nshould more probably be considered as moderate to high risk.\nResearch/audit recommendations\n1. It is important to collect data on cardiovascular events for\npatients with NASH undergoing LT to establish if their event\nrate differs from cohorts transplanted for other indications.\n2. To allow for appropriate comparisons, it is important to\ndefine what constitutes a cardiovascular event in terms of\ntype of event and time since the operation.\nPreoperative selection and assessment\nPhase I: looking for factors to risk stratify\nAn accurate and reliable means of predicting short and long term\npost-LT progression in an individual is clearly desirable but not\ncurrently available. Several factors which confer increased risk\nhave been identified (table 1) but data on their risk when added\ntogether are less clear.45 The history should seek to determine\nthe patient\u2019s functional capacity, as assessment of the capacity\nto perform a range of common daily tasks has been shown to\ncorrelate well with maximum oxygen uptake on treadmill\ntesting.50 MET is an expression of energy expenditure during\nphysical activity as a multiple of resting metabolic rate. One\nMET is considered as the resting metabolic rate, two METs\nwould represent walking at a slow pace (eg, 3 km/h) and four\nMETs would represent walking up two sets of stairs.\nPreoperative cardiorespiratory assessment in patients with\nNASH does not differ to that routinely performed in other\npotential LT recipients. Standard tests include chest radiography,\narterial blood gases, pulmonary function tests, 12 lead ECG and\nechocardiogram (with the following variables recorded: pulmo\ufffenary artery systolic pressure, right ventricular function, left\nventricular function, tricuspid regurgitation velocity and isovo\ufffelumic relaxation time).\nA retrospective analysis of patients transplanted with NASH\ncirrhosis found that the combination of age $60 years, BMI\n$30 kg/m2\n, DM and hypertension predicted a 50% mortality\nwithin 1 year of transplantation.26 This needs to be confirmed in\nlarger cohorts but is consistent with another analysis of\npredictors of increased long term mortality post-LT.51 An\nattempt to incorporate comorbidity factors in a summative\nfashion to predict long term outcome after LT using a modified\ncomorbidity index (Charlson Index) also found that the\npretransplant presence of more than one defined risk factor for\npatients undergoing elective first transplantation resulted in\na 5 year post-LT survival of <50%.52\nStratification of patients to various risk categories on the basis\nof risk markers varies across guidelines but one unifying prin\ufffeciple is the assessment of a patient\u2019s functional state, as judged\nby METs. Both European45 and American53 guidelines of\ncardiovascular evaluation and care for patients undergoing\nnon-cardiac surgery suggest that those with good functional\nTable 1 Risk markers for cardiac decompensation during liver\ntransplant surgery\nLow risk Intermediate risk High risk\nNo CVS risk factors\nNo comorbidities\nGood functional\ncapacity (>4 METs)\nAngina pectoris\nPrior myocardial infarction\nHeart failure\nStroke/transient ischaemic\nattack\nRenal dysfunction (serum\ncreatinine >170 mmol/l or\n>2 mg/dl or a creatinine\nclearance of <60 ml/min)\nor need for renal support\nDM requiring insulin therapy\nAcute heart failure\nSymptomatic valvular\nheart disease\nSignificant pulmonary\nhypertension\nRecent (within 30 days)\nacute coronary syndrome\nand/or evidence of ongoing\nmyocardial ischaemia\nSignificant cardiac\narrhythmias\nCVS, cardiovascular; DM, diabetes mellitus; METs, metabolic equivalent of tasks.\n488 Gut 2012;61:484e500. doi:10.1136/gutjnl-2011-300886\nGuidelines\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n.

This is in contrast with the\nAmerican Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)\nguidelines which recommend that potential LT recipients should\nundergo further cardiac investigation with dobutamine stress\nechocardiography and confirmatory angiography if they have\nany of the following factors: age >50 years, a history of chronic\nsmoking, a past medical or family history of heart disease, or\nDM.54\nIn the event that a patient\u2019s functional capacity is reduced to\nbelow four METs, the presence of between one53 and three45\nintermediate risk factors are required to stratify a patient as\nmoderate risk and therefore indicate the need for non-invasive\ntesting.\nAcute heart failure, symptomatic valvular disease and\npulmonary hypertension will generally preclude patients being\nlisted for LT. Pulmonary hypertension is defined as a mean\npulmonary artery pressure of >25 mm Hg at rest at cardiac\ncatheterisation.55 It also requires a pulmonary capillary wedge\npressure of #15 mm Hg and a pulmonary vascular resistance of\n$240 dyn/s/cm5\n. Portopulmonary hypertension is a separate\nindication for transplantation and will not be covered within\nthese guidelines. Some of these conditions may respond to\ntreatment, and options are expanding with improved manage\ufffement of heart failure and pulmonary hypertension, with some\ncentres reporting successful combined cardiac and LT surgery.\nRecommendation 4: All NASH patients should undergo\npreoperative risk stratification to exclude symptomatic coronary\nartery disease and assessment for the presence of structural heart\ndisease, left ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary hyperten\ufffesion. (Level C, Class I).\nRecommendation 5: Patients unable to achieve four METs,\nor those with at least one intermediate risk factor should be\nconsidered for further cardiac testing. (Level C, Class I)\nAn algorithm to aid in the investigation of cardiovascular risk\npatients with NASH cirrhosis being considered for LT is detailed\nin figure 1.\nPhase II: role of cardiac testing\nAssessment of functional capacity can be difficult in patients\nwith end stage liver disease due to NASH because of the high\nincidence of reduced mobility, physical deconditioning and\nobesity. While risk stratification will determine the next level of\ncardiovascular investigation, early discussion with a cardiologist\nexperienced in assessing cardiovascular risk in patients with end\nstage liver disease should be considered for more complex cases.\nRecommendation 6: Within a transplant centre, cardiology\ninput should be provided by cardiologists with an interest/\nexperience in the assessment of patients with liver disease.\n(Level C, Class I)\nRecommendation 7: The following moderate risk groups\nshould be discussed early with a cardiologist: (i) patients with\nchest pain of possible cardiac origin; and (ii) patients receiving\ntreatment for established coronary disease or previous coronary\nrevascularisation. (Level C, Class I)\nThe role of the cardiologist includes, but is not limited to, the\nfollowing: (i) coronary angiography (invasive or by CT); (ii)\nfunctional testing with myocardial perfusion imaging; (iii)\noptimisation of pharmacotherapy; (iv) coronary revascularisa\ufffetion; and (v) advice on perioperative cardiac management in\npatients accepted for LT.\nCardiopulmonary exercise (CPX) testing predicts survival in\nLT candidates and following LT in general. CPX involves exer\ufffecising on an upright bicycle, with assessment of the perfor\ufffemance of both heart and lungs. In essence, it measures the point\nwhen exercise becomes anaerobic, and if this measurement is\nreduced, then operative risk is deemed to be high. In two\nstudies, a threshold level of <60% peak oxygen consumption\nduring CPX independently predicted survival and length of\nhospital stay.56 57\nCardiac stress testing is directed towards establishing the\npresence of obstructive coronary disease but it appears to have\na more limited predictive value for perioperative cardiac\ndecompensation in this patient population compared with other\nhigh risk surgical groups. Dobutamine stress echocardiography\n(DSE), although moderately specific for coronary artery disease,\nlacks sensitivity in patients undergoing LT.58 59 Pre-existing high\ncardiac output in cirrhotics limits the value of DSE, and hence\ndirect inotropic stimulation with the b agonist dobutamine is\npreferential to the use of vasodilators such as adenosine or\ndypridamole. The vasodilated state of the patients with portal\nhypertension may attenuate the ability of vasodilators to\nincrease coronary arterial blood flow but the theoretical advan\ufffetage of dobutamine is often limited due to the concurrent\nadministration of b blockers and an inherent chronotropic\nincompetence found in some patients with chronic liver\ndisease.48 Guidelines on preoperative cardiac risk assessment\nindicate that patients with multiple cardiac risk markers or poor\nfunctional status undergoing high risk surgery are recommended\nfor stress testing by perfusion imaging or DSE.45 46 Negative stress\ntesting is reassuring, providing an excellent negative predictive\nvalue in patients undergoing major vascular surgery.60 61 The\npositive predictive value for perioperative myocardial infarction or\ndeath in this high risk surgery group is between 20% and 30%\nfollowing a positive stress test.61 Perfusion imaging and DSE\ndetect the presence of fixed obstructive coronary stenoses\nresponsible for myocardial ischaemia during increased myocardial\nworkload. The presence of obstructive coronary disease increases\nthe risk of perioperative myocardial infarction but other factors\nFigure 1 Assessment of cardiovascular risk in patients with non\ufffealcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) prior to liver transplantation. The\nnumber and severity of risk factors, as described in table 1, determines\nthe risk category of a patient with NASH. This is also influenced by the\nmetabolic equivalent of tasks (METs) that a patient can undertake. One\nMET is considered as the resting metabolic rate, two METs would\nrepresent walking at a slow pace (eg, 3 km/h) and four METs would\nrepresent walking up two sets of stairs. For those patients deemed to be\nat moderate risk, further investigation is required, preferably with some\nform of stress testing.

Patients with established vascular disease are\nmore likely to have (asymptomatic) coronary disease than\npatients with liver cirrhosis. This may partly explain the\ncomparably weak positive predictive value of DSE in LT\npatients. Studies have also reported poor discrimination for\nidentifying patients at risk of perioperative troponin elevation\nand cardiac decompensation.59 63 Many transplant centres use\nDSE as a preoperative screening test and the most recent AASLD\nguideline recommends DSE in smokers, patients with coronary\ndisease or type II DM.54 A positive test mandates coronary\nangiography according to this guideline but patients with non\ufffeobstructed coronary arteries may still experience cardiac\ndecompensation during LT.64 The predictive value of other non\ufffeinvasive methods such as 99Technetium labelled single photon\nemission computer tomographic studies is likewise poor.65\nCalcification of coronary arteries on CT scanning is correlated\nwith cardiovascular risk factors and the development of coro\ufffenary atherosclerosis. Coronary calcification is seen in patients\nwith the metabolic syndrome who are assessed for LT.66 Coro\ufffenary calcium scoring may be used to further define the 10 year\nrisk of cardiovascular events in asymptomatic populations.67 It\ndoes not provide information on the presence of obstructive\ncoronary disease or inducible myocardial ischaemia and there is\nno evidence to support its use in perioperative risk assessment.\nThe above tests may aid in triaging patients in regards to\ndiagnostic coronary investigations. Apart from standard invasive\ncoronary angiography, CT coronary angiography is used with\nincreasing frequency in the assessment of patients with possible\ncardiac chest pain. Despite the advantage of minimal invasive\ufffeness, it is limited in its ability to discriminate obstructive\ncoronary lesions by the presence of coronary calcification and\ncoronary stents. CT coronary angiography has been used to rule\nout coronary disease in patients undergoing heart valve surgery\nand non-cardiac surgery. Recent guidelines have suggested an\napplication to further evaluate patients considered at interme\ufffediate risk of coronary disease undergoing non-cardiac surgery but\nit is currently not a recommended technique for perioperative\nrisk assessment in non-cardiac surgery.45 68 Further research is\nrequired and no recommendation was given for this imaging\nmodality in the most recent joint European Society of Cardi\ufffeology and European Society of Anaesthesiology guideline on\npreoperative cardiac risk assessment.45\nRecommendation 8: There is insufficient evidence to\nrecommend a single stress test for NASH patients undergoing LT\nassessment. The choice of test will be in part determined by\nlocal expertise. (Level C, Class I).\nPharmacological risk reduction with b blockers and statins has\nbeen extensively studied. Randomised trials selecting high risk\npatients, cohort studies and meta-analyses provide evidence\nsupporting a decrease in cardiac mortality and myocardial\ninfarction using cardioselective b blockers in patients with\nclinical risk factors undergoing high and intermediate risk\nsurgery.69 Treatment should be titrated and initiated ideally\nbetween 30 days and at least 1 week before surgery, with\nsuggested targets of heart rate 60e70 beats/min and systolic\nblood pressure >100 mm Hg.45 Higher dose b blockade started\nin the perioperative period was associated with increased\nmortality, reinforcing the need for gradual titrated introduction\nof therapy.70 Recent data have suggested that use of b blockers\nin patients with refractory ascites is associated with poor\nsurvival and result in higher rates of paracentesis induced\ncirculatory dysfunction,71 72 suggesting that b blockers should\nbe contraindicated in these patients.\nRecommendation 9: Patients without refractory ascites\nshould be considered for a cardioselective b blocker such as\nbisoprolol prior to LT. This should be titrated gradually and not\nstarted in the immediate perioperative period. Patients already\nreceiving propanolol or carvedilol for prophylaxis against variceal\nbleeding should continue on those non-selective agents. (Level B,\nClass IIa).\nSimilarly, starting statins has been shown to reduce cardio\ufffevascular mortality by 44% in meta-analyses in patients under\ufffegoing non-cardiac surgery.69 73 Stopping of statins may also\nresult in a rebound effect and lead to increased cardiovascular\ncomplications.74 Pravastatin is the statin of choice as it is\ntransformed enzymatically in the liver cytosol whereas all other\nstatins undergo extensive microsomal metabolism by the cyto\ufffechrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme systems and thus have greater\ninteractions with CNIs.75 Specifically, simvastatin and atorvas\ufffetatin should be avoided in patients undergoing LT due to the\ninteractions with CNIs resulting in rhabdomyolysis.\nRecommendation 10: Pravastatin should be considered in\npatients not already receiving a statin or continued in those\npatients already receiving it. Ideally, pravastatin should be\nstarted at least 1 week before surgery. Specifically, simvastatin\nand atorvastatin should be avoided in patients undergoing LT\ndue to interactions with CNIs. (Level B, Class I).\nASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF NUTRITIONAL STATUS\nDURING TRANSPLANT WORKUP\nPerioperative morbidity and mortality is increased following\nmajor surgical procedures among the obese because of con\ufffecomitant cardiovascular disease, hyperlipidaemia and pulmo\ufffenary dysfunction.76 The AASLD practice guideline, among\nothers, suggests that morbid obesity should be considered\na contraindication to LT.54 77\nInfluence of obesity on postoperative liver transplant outcome\nA consistent drawback with the majority of studies examining\nthe influence of obesity on transplant outcome has been that the\namount of ascites/peripheral oedema has not been taken into\naccount when calculating BMI. Table 2 details how weight can\nbe adjusted for ascites and peripheral oedema. This is important\ngiven that ascites is a marker of disease severity. Of the 12\npublished studies, only Leonard\u2019s study79 measured ascites\nvolume at transplantation and identified those with obesity as\nopposed to those with marked ascites.77 79e89 A second draw\ufffeback is that the conclusions are drawn only from those patients\nwith obesity who have undergone transplantation, so extrapo\ufffelation from these to all potential candidates may be misleading.\nAnalysis of the United Network for Organ Sharing database\ndemonstrated that primary graft non-function and immediate, 1\nyear and 2 year mortality were significantly higher in the\nmorbidly obese group (p<0.05). In addition, 5 year mortality\nwas significantly higher in both severely and morbidly obese\nsubjects (p<0.05), mostly as a result of adverse cardiovascular\nTable 2 Correction for fluid excess in body mass78\nAscites/kg Peripheral oedema/kg\nMinimal 2.2 1\nModerate 6 5 (knees)\nSevere 14 or more 10 (thigh)\n490 Gut 2012;61:484e500. doi:10.1136/gutjnl-2011-300886\nGuidelines\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n.

Further analysis of the United\nNetwork for Organ Sharing database in 2009 drew broadly\nsimilar conclusions, although it suggested that obese patients\n(BMI >40 mg/kg2\n) tended to be transplanted with more\nadvanced MELD scores and hence these patients might be best\nserved by receiving a graft at an earlier stage than non-morbidly\nobese counterparts.89 This is borne out by a large study of 29 000\npatients waitlisted for LTs which found that obese recipients\nwaited longer and were more likely to be passed over.90 Looking\nat UK LToutcome data for patients with hepatitis C, a high BMI\nwas an independent predictor of a worse outcome at 90 days,\nbut not long term.91\nThe importance of correcting for ascites volume was\ndemonstrated by Leonard et al, correction resulting in 11e20%\nof patients moving into a lower BMI classification.79 The rela\ufffetive risk for mortality increased by 7% for each litre of ascites\nremoved, with the conclusion that corrected BMI is not an\nindependent predictor of patient or graft survival. This would\nsuggest that obesity should not be considered to be an absolute\ncontraindication to LT in the absence of other relative contra\ufffeindications. The decision to list a patient will include an\nassessment of all potential relative contraindications, such as\na BMI of >40.\nRecommendation 11: There are no data to support an\nabsolute cut-off for BMI and LT although patients with a BMI\n>40 mg/kg2 are likely to have an increased postoperative and\nlong term mortality. BMI should be corrected for the presence of\nascites and peripheral oedema (Level C, Class IIa).\nWeight loss in liver transplant recipients\nThere are no data on the following: (i) impact of weight loss\npretransplant, (ii) data on intervention studies post-LT or (iii)\nstrategies for maintaining weight loss in transplant recipients.\nBehaviour changes required for liver transplantation\nFor tobacco, alcohol or illicit substances, a requirement for\ncomplete abstinence is widely accepted and enforceable, and\nadherence can be checked. Food, however, is a basic requirement\nwhich cannot be proscribed, and food restriction in patients\nwith end stage liver disease is potentially harmful. Despite the\nappearance of obesity, some patients with advanced liver disease\nwill have protein calorie malnutrition, and therefore should be\nfully assessed by a dietician for evidence of protein malnutrition.\nDietary restriction risks worsening protein calorie malnutrition,\nand should only be contemplated under careful supervision by\na dietician. Protein calorie malnutrition is associated with\nreduced graft and patient survival.92 A weight orientated\ncontract after LT is superficially attractive, to mimic the existing\nno alcohol contract, but the practicalities would need careful\nconsideration.\nRecommendation 12: Weight loss should not be recom\ufffemended in patients with decompensated end stage liver disease\ndue to the risk of protein calorie malnutrition. (Level C, Class\nIII).\nRecommendation 13: For patients with compensated\ncirrhosis and HCC, it may be appropriate to try and achieve\nweight loss before proceeding/while waiting for a transplant.\n(Level C, Class II).\nAssessment of patient nutritional status\nNutrition management in patients with advanced liver disease\nand obesity is problematic. Accurate estimation of nutritional\nstatus is difficult in patients with advanced liver disease,\nregardless of whether or not they are obese, in part due to poor\ninterobserver reproducibility and overestimation of values\nbecause of third spacing of fluid. Protein calorie malnutrition is\na condition of body wasting related to dietary deficiency of\ncalories and protein, is found in 65e90% of patients with end\nstage liver disease93 and is associated with reduced graft and\npatient survival.92 94 The detection and management of protein\ncalorie malnutrition is therefore an integral part of the dietary\nassessment.\nSkinfold measurement and handgrip strength are simple tests\nof nutritional status, with the latter proving to be a good\npredictor of complications in patients with advanced liver\ndisease.95 Other methods include the subjective global assess\ufffement, which combines multiple elements of nutritional assess\ufffement to classify the severity of malnutrition.96\nIn 1997, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and\nMetabolism developed guidelines for meeting nutritional goals in\npatients with end stage liver disease.97 This included a diet\nconsisting of 35% fat (15e20% monosaturates, minimal trans\nfats, reduced saturated fats, <10% total fat), 50% carbohydrate\n(minimal refined carbohydrate) and 15% protein. For obese\npatients with end stage liver disease, the transplant team should\nbe aware that dietary restriction risks enhancing protein calorie\nmalnutrition, and should only be contemplated under careful\nsupervision by a dietician. If safe, calorie restriction should be\nlimited to target no more than 0.5e1 kg (1e2 lb) weight loss per\nweek and to avoid weight loss exceeding 1.5 kg per week. In some\ncircumstances malnutrition may be present despite apparent\nobesity, in which case supplementation with night time tube\nfeeding may be of value.98 Patients with well preserved liver\nfunction and small HCCs may benefit from weight loss but only\nif the delay does not adversely affect their cancer.\nRecommendation 14: All potential NASH transplant recip\ufffeients, including those with an elevated BMI, should be assessed\nby a dietician and supplemental feeding considered if protein\ncalorie malnutrition is present. (Level C, Class I).\nRecommendation 15: Dietary assessment of patients being\nassessed for LT should include use of handgrip strength,\nanthropometry and/or subjective global assessment to objec\ufffetively define the patient\u2019s nutritional status, and start supple\ufffementation if required. (Level B, Class I).\nRecommendation 16: Dietary assessment of patients should\nbe repeated on an annual basis while they remain on the waiting\nlist for LT. (Level B, Class I).\nSURGICAL ASPECTS OF LIVER TRANSPLANTATION FOR\nPATIENTS WITH NASH\nPerioperative issues in NASH patients undergoing liver\ntransplantation\nPatients undergoing LT for NASH pose additional challenges for\nsurgical teams. As the potential donor pool continues to evolve,\nthe use of extended criteria donors in NASH recipients needs to\nbe assessed, especially donor grafts with moderately severe\nsteatosis. Such patients are also less likely to be suitable recipi\ufffeents for split liver and living related transplantation as the\nsegmental liver graft is more likely to be relatively small for size\nfor the obese NASH recipient. Consequently, patients with\nNASH may have restricted access to the already severely limited\ndonor organ pool, reducing their chances of undergoing LT.\nFew data exist on the use of steatotic donor livers and their\nimpact on the development of post-transplant recurrent NASH.\nAs disease recurrence after LT is common and the diagnosis\nbased on liver histology, the performance of a core liver biopsy\nGut 2012;61:484e500. doi:10.1136/gutjnl-2011-300886 491\nGuidelines\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n. Technical Services Serials\nat New York University, Serials Bobst Library on November 3, 2025 http://gut.bmj.com/ Downloaded from 10 January 2012. 10.1136/gutjnl-2011-300886 on Gut: first published as \n\nafter reperfusion and prior to abdominal closure is of value to\nprovide baseline liver histology for comparison with late post\ufffetransplant biopsies. These biopsies may also assist the evalua\ufffetion of patients with early graft dysfunction, which these grafts\nmay be more predisposed to.\nBariatric surgery at the time of transplantation\nLT surgery provides an opportunity to perform additional bari\ufffeatric surgical procedures to facilitate weight loss and also limit\nthe risk of recurrent disease. Such procedures do add an addi\ufffetional risk to what is already a high risk procedure. The presence\nof portal hypertension or post-reperfusion coagulopathy would\nbe strong reasons to perform the least invasive additional bari\ufffeatric surgical procedure. As a small proportion of LT patients\nmay require a future Roux-en-Y biliary enteric anastomosis, it is\npreferable to limit bariatric procedures to non-bypass proce\ufffedures. Similarly, the use of gastric bands in the setting of\nadvanced liver disease and subsequent post LT immunosup\ufffepression may increase the risk of sepsis related to the device.\nAlmost no evidence exists on the role of bariatric surgery at\nthe time of LT. It would therefore be logical to consider such an\napproach only in highly selected situations, possibly in recipi\ufffeents with severe morbid obesity, those with failed treatment of\nobesity or in patients with recurrent disease undergoing\nretransplantation. The choice of procedure should be guided by\nthe status of the recipient at the end of the transplant procedure,\nthe essential requirements being the presence of satisfactory\nearly liver graft function, adequate haemostatic parameters,\ncontrol of all bleeding and the availability of local bariatric\nsurgical expertise. The use of less invasive options such as gastric\nballoons is potentially attractive, as this will keep the additional\nrisks to a minimum. The intragastric balloon (IGB) is a safe,\nendoscopically placed, saline filled, silicone balloon which can\nremain in the stomach for up to 6 months.99 There are good\nefficacy data in non-transplant patients, such that some bariatric\nservices use it as a firstline procedure and progress only to formal\nbariatric surgery if the IGB fails. The weight loss achievable by\nthe IGB has been shown to be up to 32 kg after 6 months.\nPortal hypertension is a contraindication to IGB placement\nand may limit its utility in early post-transplant patients. The\nrate of spontaneous deflation of the IGB is very low at <0.1%. In\nthe unlikely event that the IGB does deflate unexpectedly,\nmethylene blue dye admixed with the saline in the balloon will\ndiscolour the stool and so provide prompt evidence of leakage of\nthe balloon contents.\nRecommendation 17: Consider bariatric surgery at the time\nof LT in recipients with severe morbid obesity, those with failed\ntreatment of obesity or in patients with recurrent NASH\nundergoing retransplantation. (Level C, Class IIa).\nBariatric surgery after liver transplantation\nThe LT recipient who remains morbidly obese or develops\nrecurrent or de novo NASH may in the course of time be\nconsidered a candidate for bariatric surgery. Little or no data exist\non the timing and selection of such patients for bariatric surgery.\nThe vast majority of these patients will be on modest stable\nmaintenance immunosuppression, and ideally would be off\ncorticosteroids or on low dose maintenance corticosteroids. Most\npatients are on a combination of an antiproliferative agent\n(azathioprine or mycophenolate) and a CNI (tacrolimus or\nciclosporin). Patients on mammalian target of rapamycin inhib\ufffeitors (mTORi, sirolimus or everolimus) will need to stop these\ndrugs 4 weeks before an operation as they are associated with\nimpaired wound healing, and alternative regimens considered.\nThere are few data on which to base recommendations for\npatient and procedure selection for patients undergoing bariatric\nsurgery post-LT. Extensive adhesions may make the laparoscopic\napproach difficult or sometime impossible, with a higher risk of\nopen conversion and its additional risks. The use of intestinal\nbypass surgery may have an impact on future biliary enteric\nsurgery and may also affect the absorption of immunosuppres\ufffesive medication. In view of these issues, it is preferable to\nconsider the use of endoscopic placed gastric balloons as the\nprocedure of choice, followed by non-bypass gastric surgery as\nthe next option. Case reports support the feasibility and efficacy\nof Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for recurrent NASH in LT recipients\nwith morbid obesity.100\nRecommendation 18: Consider bariatric surgery in recipi\ufffeents with severe morbid obesity, those with failed treatment of\nobesity or in patients with developing progressive NASH with\nfibrosis in allograft. (Level C, Class IIa).\nPERIOPERATIVE MONITORING\nThe anhepatic and reperfusion phases during LT are associated\nwith a high risk of cardiovascular instability. The former occurs\ndue to a sudden reduction in venous return, and the latter\nbecause of the effects of the return of cold, acidotic and hyper\ufffekalaemic preservation fluid into the circulation.101 Release of\nvasoactive mediators and myocardial depression related to free\noxygen radical production are additional pathogenetic mecha\ufffenisms. The clinical picture is characterised by sudden onset of\nprofound arterial hypotension due to the combined effects of\nreduction in systemic vascular resistance, increase in pulmonary\nvascular resistance and drop in heart rate and cardiac output.\nPatients with NASH and associated cardiovascular risk factors\nmay be particularly vulnerable to these effects, and advanced\nhaemodynamic monitoring with pulmonary artery catheters\n(PAC) is routinely performed in many transplant centres. Despite\nthe theoretical advantage of invasive perioperative monitoring and\ntherapeutic guidance based on PAC data, randomised controlled\ntrials in high risk surgery102 or in the critically ill103 have not\nshown any evidence of benefit. Indeed, there are no controlled\ndata showing an advantage of PAC use, or indeed any other form\nof advanced haemodynamic monitoring tool, during LT.\nTrans-oesophageal echocardiography provides immediate and\ndirect assessment of cardiac structures and the functional status\nof both ventricles. It is an excellent tool to diagnose new onset\nregional wall motion abnormalities and enables assessment of\nthe filling status of the left ventricle as well as estimation of\npulmonary artery pressures. Compared with PAC it is relatively\nnon-invasive and low risk; however, it is operator dependent and\nrequires appropriate training.

The control group only received therapy if\nthe glucose level exceeded 11.9 mmol/l. A minority of patients\nhad a history of DM (13%) and only 5% of patients were\nadmitted following transplantation, which makes extrapolation\nof the findings to the post-LT setting difficult. Subsequent\nmulticentre studies and a meta-analysis failed to reproduce the\nresults of this trial, and concerns have been raised in regards to\nthe possible harmful effects of tight glucose control through an\nincreased incidence of life threatening hypoglycaemia.\nThe largest study to date from the Australian and New\nZealand Intensive Care Society collaborators (Normoglycaemia\nin Intensive Care EvaluationeSurvival Using Glucose Algorithm\nRegulation (NICEeSUGAR)), a multicentre randomised\ncontrolled trial, randomised more than 6000 patients to tight\nglucose control of 4.5e6 mmol/l versus 10 mmol/l or less.\nSurprisingly, intensive insulin therapy increased mortality in\nboth medical and surgical patients, perhaps in association with\nan increased incidence of severe hypoglycaemia.105 In compar\ufffeison with the earlier trial, patients were primarily enterally fed\nand they received significantly less calories and insulin; however,\nthe blood sugar level in the control group was comparable,\naveraging 8 mmol/l. In the absence of evidence in relation to\nperioperative blood sugar management in NASH and extrapo\ufffelating from the available data pertaining to ICU patients,\nmoderate glucose control targeting levels between 6 and\n10 mmol/l is recommended.\nRecommendation 20: Moderately tight glucose control\n(6e10 mmol/l) should be targeted during the early post-trans\ufffeplant course in patients of all aetiologies. (Level A, Class II).\nNASH and statin use in the perioperative period\nDyslipidaemia is a common finding in patients with NASH and\nstatins are widely used for this indication. Recent studies have\nextended the use of statins beyond traditional indications of\nlipid lowering therapy. Cholesterol independent therapeutic,\npleiotropic effects of statins include anti-inflammatory and\nantioxidative properties, improvement of endothelial function\nand increased nitric oxide bioavailability. In addition to anti\ufffeinflammatory properties, statins may interfere with the activa\ufffetion of the coagulation cascade and modulate platelet function.\nSeveral retrospective trials and prospective studies in patients\nundergoing vascular surgery have shown a beneficial effect of\nstatins, with reduction in the incidence of perioperative\nmyocardial infarction, coupled with an excellent safety profile.\nSeveral experimental and observational trials postulate a benefi\ufffecial role of statins in sepsis, especially in patients with suspected\nbacterial infection.106\nPatients already receiving statins should not have their treat\ufffement interrupted perioperatively or during the intensive care\nstay to maintain the beneficial pleiotropic effects and reduce the\nrisk of cardiac events.107 As statins can interact with CNIs,\ncareful attention should be paid to the choice and dose of statin\nused. Pravastatin is the statin of choice in view of it having the\nleast interactions with CNIs.75\nRecommendation 21: If started preoperatively, statin\ntherapy should be continued during the postoperative phase.\n(Level B, Class I).\nIMMUNOSUPPRESSION\nLifelong immunosuppression (IMS) is required in the great\nmajority of patients following LT, irrespective of primary indi\ufffecation. Overall, liver allograft recipients have an increased risk of\nmorbidity and mortality from cardiac and cerebrovascular\ndisease, weight gain and DM.108 Maintenance IMS regimens are\nbased on either monotherapy with a CNI (ciclosporin or tacro\ufffelimus) or an mTORi (sirolimus or everolimus), or combination\ntherapy with two or more of corticosteroids, CNI, mTORi and\nan antimetabolite (usually azathioprine or mycophenolate). The\nselection of the most appropriate regimen for the patient is\nlikely to vary during the course of the lifetime of the graft\nand will depend on many factors, including the indication,\nlikelihood and consequences of allograft rejection, and comorbid\nconditions.109\nAlthough both recurrent and de novo NASH may develop in\nthe allograft, there have been no significant prospective trials\nevaluating different IMS regimens in patients grafted for NASH.\nThe selection of the most appropriate IMS regimen for the liver\nallograft recipient transplanted for NASH will depend on many\nfactors, including:\n< The time after transplant. In many cases, immunosuppres\ufffesion load can be reduced; many centres withdraw steroids by\n3 months.\n< Risk of rejection. This will depend on many factors, including\nthe indication for transplantation, a history of early or late\nrejection and the response to increased immunosuppression.\n< Comorbid conditions. For example, CNI may be reduced or\navoided where there is renal impairment.\n< Indication. mTORi may be preferred for those with liver cell\ncancer.\n< Complications. CNIs may be reduced or avoided when renal\nimpairment develops, and mycophenolate should be avoided\nwhen neutropenia develops.\nImpact of immunosuppressive agents on risk factors for NASH\nThe currently used agents all have differing impacts on compo\ufffenents of the metabolic syndrome, as shown in table 3 .51 108e116\nCiclosporin and tacrolimus have slightly differing effects on\nsome of these risks: for example, new onset diabetes after\ntransplantation is more common with tacrolimus than ciclo\ufffesporin110 while hyperlipidaemia is more common with ciclo\ufffesporin.109 Due to superior patient outcome, tacrolimus is\npreferred to ciclosporin and is the firstline CNI used in clinical\npractice.117\nSelection of an immunosuppressive regimen\nThe prime goal of any immunosuppression regimen must be\nmaintenance of normal graft function and prevention of graft\ndamage from immune and other factors, with an acceptable side\neffect profile. However, the selection of specific combinations of\nimmunosuppressive agents may allow a reduction of the risk of\nrecurrence of NASH in the graft and the associated vascular and\nmetabolic side effects.\nWhile there are no prospective studies evaluating different\nimmunosuppressive regimens in this context, the following may\nTable 3 Impact of immunosuppressive agents on components of the\nmetabolic syndrome and hepatic steatosis\nClass of agent Hypertension Dyslipidaemia DM Weight gain\nHepatic\nsteatosis\nCorticosteroids + + ++ ++ ++\nCNI ++ ++ ++ + e\nAntimetabolites e e ee e\nmTORi e +++ +/\u0001 e e\nCNI, calcineurin inhibitor; mTORi, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors.\nGut 2012;61:484e500. doi:10.1136/gutjnl-2011-300886 493\nGuidelines\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n.

Where steroid free regimens\nare used, induction therapy (such as antithymocyte globulin or\ninterleukin 2 receptor antagonism) should be considered. (Level\nB, Class IIa).\nRecommendation 23: Tacrolimus levels should be 5e8 ng/\nml to reduce the impact on renal function and dyslipidaemia.\nMycophenolate should be used as the preferred antimetabolite,\nto permit lower levels of tacrolimus. (Level B, Class IIa).\nIt is essential that modification of the immunosuppressive\nregimen should be considered in combination with lifestyle and\npharmacological approaches to reducing the recurrence and\nimpact of metabolic syndrome. This includes regular monitoring\nand treatment (where indicated) of DM, hypertension and\nhyperlipidaemia.\nRecommendation 24: Close follow-up and early recognition\nand treatment of the recognised consequences of transplantation\nand immunosuppression (such as weight gain, hypertension,\nhyperlipidaemia, DM and renal impairment) remain the key to\npreventing excess risk from recurrent NASH. (Level C, Class I).\nPOST-TRANSPLANT MONITORING OF NASH PATIENTS AND\nDISEASE RECURRENCE\nNASH recurrence in the liver allograft\nMany studies have described histological features of recurrent\nfatty liver disease in patients transplanted for NASH.25 27 122e128\nSimilar changes have also been observed in patients transplanted\nfor conditions other than NASH.124 125 129e134 Some of these\npatients were initially diagnosed as having cryptogenic cirrhosis\nat the time of listing but were subsequently found to have\npretransplant risk factors for fatty liver disease while others\npresumably reflect transplant related risk factors that predispose\nto the metabolic syndrome.\nRecommendation 25: Histological examination of the\nexplanted liver should be carried out to confirm the presence of\nfeatures compatible with end stage NASH and to exclude\nfeatures suggesting an alternative diagnosis. (Class I, Level C).\nHistological assessment of NASH recurrence\nThe histological features of NASH in the liver allograft are\nessentially the same as those occurring in the native liver.\nHowever, changes seen in post-transplant biopsies may be\nmodified by a number of other complications of LT. The chal\ufffelenge to the pathologist is to distinguish whether all features are\nattributable to fatty liver disease or whether there is an addi\ufffetional post-transplant complication. Conditions that may\nhave overlapping histological features with certain compo\ufffenents of NASH include rejection, biliary complications and\nvascular/architectural changes, including nodular regenerative\nhyperplasia.135e137\nLate rejection may lack the typical portal tract features of\nacute rejection and frequently includes centrilobular necroin\ufffeflammatory changes (\u2018central perivenulitis\u2019) that may be associ\ufffeated with hepatocyte ballooning and with the development of\ncentrilobular fibrosis. Biliary complications are characterised by\nperiportal ductular reaction and fibrosis, both of which have been\ndescribed as features of NASH in the native liver.138 Nodular\nregenerative hyperplasia is an increasingly recognised finding in\nlate post-transplant biopsies and may be associated with the\ndevelopment of perisinusoidal fibrosis in centrilobular regions.139\nThe latter sometimes occurs as an isolated finding without\nconspicuous nodularity. There are also interactions between HCV\ninfection, insulin resistance and metabolic fatty liver disease,\nwhich may be important in the pathogenesis and severity of\nrecurrent HCV infection and de novo NASH.132 140e143 For this\nreason, biopsies performed elsewhere should be reviewed at the\ntransplant centre.\nSemiquantitative scoring systems are increasingly used to\nassess the severity of NASH in the native liver.144 The most\nwidely used systems are those described by Brunt145 and\nKleiner, 146 both of which grade the severity of steatosis, hepa\ufffetocyte ballooning and lobular inflammation, and stage the\nseverity of fibrosis. Although several studies have assessed the\nhistological severity of NASH in the liver allograft, the clinical\nutility of formal scoring systems in this context has not been\nvalidated. Problems may arise if there are coexistent graft\ncomplications that can mimic some of the NASH related\nfeatures that are used for histological grading or staging. Scoring\nshould therefore only be carried out if the changes seen can be\nattributed to NASH alone.\nRecommendation 26: The main role of biopsy is to allow\ndiagnosis and staging of liver histopathology. Where NASH is\nthe only or dominant pathology, liver allograft biopsies can be\nscored using the Kleiner classification. Biopsies performed else\ufffewhere should be reviewed at the transplant centre to ensure\nreproducibility. (Class I, Level C).\nFrequency and impact of NASH recurrence\nFatty change occurs in 60e100% of patients within a few\nmonths of transplantation, and approximately 10e40% develop\nfeatures of steatohepatitis, albeit usually not severe. Approxi\ufffemately 10% of patients progress to bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis\nby 10 years post-transplant.27 Likewise, features of fatty liver\ndisease are commonly seen in protocol biopsies from patients\ntransplanted for conditions other than NASH.134 147 148 One\ufffethird of patients with histological evidence of recurrent NASH\nhave normal liver enzymes, which supports the role of protocol\nliver biopsies in monitoring disease progression in the liver\nallograft.127 While disease progression is rapid in occasional\ncases, resulting in graft failure within 2e3 years of trans\ufffeplantation,123 in the majority of cases recurrent NASH does not\nappear to have a major impact on graft survival in the first\n5 years post-transplant.27 149 150 However, the long term clinical\nimportance of recurrent NASH is not yet known, and data from\nthe pretransplant setting indicate that NASH confers a worse\nprognosis to that of simple steatosis over a 10e15 year period.\n494 Gut 2012;61:484e500. doi:10.1136/gutjnl-2011-300886\nGuidelines\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n.

(Class IIa, Level C).\nRecommendation 28: Post-transplant monitoring of\npatients with a fatty liver on US should include protocol liver\nbiopsies to detect disease recurrence, as liver function tests may\nbe normal. Repeat biopsy should be considered every 3 years\nunless there is a clinical indication for more frequent biopsies.\n(Class IIa, Level C).\nFactors predicting NASH recurrence\nCumulative steroid dose after LT has been shown to predict\nrecurrence of NASH in the allograft25 but further work is\nrequired to identify whether other factors such as BMI, dysli\ufffepidaemia and diabetic status/control are also responsible. Use of\nangiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors has been suggested to\nreduce recurrence post-transplant.132\nResearch/audit recommendation\nIt will be important to compare non-invasive modalities for the\nassessment of NASH and fibrosis with liver biopsy post-LT.\nPOST-TRANSPLANT MANAGEMENT OF NASH\nObesity and weight management\nPatients transplanted for NASH are at an increased risk for the\nsubsequent development of features of the metabolic syndrome.\nNew onset obesity is reported in 17e43% of post-transplant\npatients.128 151e153 In addition, hypertension is reported in 35%,\nimpaired glucose tolerance/DM in 16%, hypercholesterolaemia\nin 18% and hypertriglyceridaemia in 19% of patients.128 Overt\npost-transplant metabolic syndrome comprising a constellation\nof cardiovascular risk factors may be present in up to 58% of\npatients.109 154 155 Importantly, 26% of deaths in post-transplant\nNASH patients are due to cardiovascular causes128 and those\npatients with post-transplant metabolic syndrome have signifi\ufffecantly more cardiovascular events than those without metabolic\nsyndrome (30% vs 8%).154\nMorbidly obese patients (BMI >40 kg/m2\n) have a higher\nincidence of primary graft non-function post-transplant but this\ndoes not appear to impact on 1e2 year graft survival. However,\n30 day, 1 year and 2 year mortality are significantly higher in\nmorbidly obese patients. Five year mortality is increased in both\nsevere (BMI >35 kg/m2\n) and morbid obesity but this is not\na reflection of intraoperative mortality. Using a proportional\nhazards model of survival, 2 year survival is independently\npredicted by morbid obesity and type 2 DM.77\nWhile it makes clinical sense to optimise weight management\nand reduce cardiovascular risk, there are currently no published\nstudies that have examined the impact of weight reduction on\noutcome in patients transplanted for NASH. In a single study,\n>90 min of exercise per week was associated with improved\nquality of life outcomes as measured by the SF-36 questionnaire\nin post-LT patients although the precise indication for trans\ufffeplantation was not defined in this cohort.156\nRecommendation 29: Post-transplant patients should\nreceive support, advice and treatment in order achieve a target\nBMI of <25 kg/m2\n. This should be in the context of a multi\ufffedisciplinary team, incorporating dietary modification, exercise\nintervention and the potential use of pharmacotherapy and\nsurgical intervention where appropriate. (Level C, Class I).\nInsulin resistance and type 2 diabetes\nStudies have reported a variable prevalence of post-transplant\nDM and although some of the variability may be explained\nby different diagnostic criteria, values range from 13% to\n61%.154 157e159 The prevalence of DM in the post-transplant\ngroup is 6.0 times higher (95% CI 4.2 to 8.4) than in age and\nsex matched control populations.160 Insulin resistance has\nbeen documented in almost all patients with pretransplant\ncirrhosis.161 162 After transplantation, insulin sensitivity\nimproves,161e163 but importantly many patients (in excess of\n40%) remain insulin resistant.109\nPatients with DM have increased mortality post-transplant in\ncomparison with non-diabetic patients.34 While mortality\nin patients whose DM is controlled by diet alone is not increased\nin comparison with non-diabetic post transplant patients, those\npatients on oral agents and/or insulin therapy have increased\nmortality.164 More detailed outcome studies are urgently needed\nand there are currently no published data that have examined\nthe impact of glycaemic control on outcome in patients trans\ufffeplanted for NASH.\nRecommendation 30: Post-transplant patients should be\nscreened for the presence of DM and, if present, reviewed\nregularly for the development of complications. Glycaemic\ncontrol should be optimised in accordance with NICE guidance.\n(Level A, Class I).\nCardiovascular risk\nThere is a high incidence of cardiovascular events in LT recipi\ufffeents, with an increased standardised risk compared with a\nnon-transplant population.41 Twenty-six per cent of deaths in\npost-transplant NASH patients are due to cardiovascular\ncauses.128 Patients with post-transplant metabolic syndrome\nhave significantly more cardiovascular events than those\nwithout metabolic syndrome (30% vs 8%).154\nRecommendation 31: Patients transplanted for NASH\nshould be closely monitored on a 6 monthly basis for risk factors\nfor cardiovascular disease (BP, lipids, haemoglobin A1c), which\nshould be addressed with the intention of reducing cardiovas\ufffecular events. (Level II-3, Level C Class I) (Level C, Class I).\nHypertension\nThe prevalence of hypertension after LT is significantly higher\nthan that in the general population (standard prevalence ratio\n3.07, 95% CI 2.35 to 3.93).160 While accepted JNC-7 (Seventh\nReport of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection,\nEvaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure) definitions of\nhypertension applydthat is BP $140/90 mm Hgdpatients with\ntype 2 DM, common in this population, and/or renal dysfunction,\nshould have a target BP <130/80 mm Hg.\nNon-pharmacological measures including weight reduction,\nsalt restriction, physical activity and alcohol restriction are\nrecommended despite the absence of specific trials. The aim of\npharmacological therapy is to achieve the target BP, and in the\nsetting of LT there is evidence that calcium channel blockers,\nb blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are\nefficacious in this respect.165e168 Specific agents may also confer\nadditional benefits, such as reduction of proteinuria169 and\nprevention of liver fibrosis170 with angiotensin converting\nenzyme inhibitors, although these are not yet proven.171\nRecommendation 32: A BP target of 140/90 mm Hg (130/\n80 mm Hg in patients with DM and/or renal dysfunction)\nshould be aimed for.

(Level C, Class II).\nDyslipidaemia\nThe prevalence of post-LT dyslipidaemia ranges from 66% to\n85%, usually with a mixed picture of elevated total cholesterol\nand triglycerides.172 Although standard treatment thresholds\napply, a target LDL cholesterol of <2.6 mmol/l is advised as the\n10 year cardiovascular event rate exceeds 20% for the LT popu\ufffelation.172 Therapeutic lifestyle changes are recommended,\nalthough not evidence based. Statins have been shown to be\nefficacious173 174; however, consideration should be given to drug\ninteractions (eg, ciclosporin and calcium channel blockers)\nwhich can be minimised with the use of pravastatin.108 Ezeti\ufffemibe has been demonstrated to be effective at reducing serum\ncholesterol and to have few side effects and no interaction with\nimmunosuppressive regimens.175 However, long term outcome\nstudies are not yet available for this agent.\nRecommendation 34: A target LDL cholesterol of\n<2.6 mmol/l is advised as the 10 year cardiovascular event rate\nexceeds 20% for the LT population. Pravastatin and ezetimibe\nare preferred agents in view of their demonstrated efficacy and\nabsence of interactions with CNIs. (Level C, Class IIa).\nNON-ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE IN CHILDREN\nNASH is now the commonest liver disease in childhood,\nreflecting the global increase in childhood obesity.176 177 NASH\ncurrently affects approximately 10% of adolescents and up to\n40% of obese adolescents.178 The majority of children who have\nundergone biopsy for suspected NASH have some degree of\nhepatic fibrosis. This is usually mild, but risk factors for\nincreased fibrosis include age, the degree of obesity, male sex,\nethnicity and hypopituitarism.176 179\nIncreased carotid artery intimal thickness occurs in children\nwith NASH and they have also been shown to have increased\nmortality.180 181 It is unclear at present whether the presence of\nNASH is itself an independent risk factor for cardiovascular\ndisease in obese children.\nThere are four published cases of paediatric transplantation for\nNASH.181e183 In two cases the primary aetiology was hypopitu\ufffeitarism, and all four cases had hepatopulmonary syndrome as the\nimmediate indication for transplantation. All survived, but\nrecurrence of NASH with significant fibrosis was universal within\nthe first year. In one case this required repeat transplantation after\n3 years. Another case was treated with metformin and initial\nmoderate fibrosis resolved 3 years post-transplant.\nPre-transplant assessment\nInvestigations should include routine pretransplant assessment\nbut in addition should focus on components of the metabolic\nsyndrome, including fasting lipid profile, hyperuricaemia,\nhypertension and evaluation of pituitary function. Specific\nscreening for hepatopulmonary syndrome including, as\na minimum, saturation monitoring, is indicated. At present\nthere is insufficient evidence to justify formal invasive screening\nfor cardiovascular disease.\nIndications for transplantation\nThese are similar to those for end stage liver disease of any cause.\nManagement post-transplantation\nNo specific evidence guidelines can be recommended; however,\nin the absence of autoimmune disease, steroid administration\nshould be minimised. It would appear sensible to minimise\ncalcineurin inhibition by the use of antimetabolites such as\nmycophenolate or azathioprine.\nMonitoring\nEvidence based recommendations cannot be given. Good prac\ufffetice would suggest active monitoring for components of the\nmetabolic syndrome and protocol liver biopsies at 1, 5 and 10\nyears post-transplant.\nDe novo post-transplant NASH\nThis may well turn out to be a quantitatively more important\nissue than NASH as a primary indication for LT, given the high\nincidence of obesity following transplantation. However, although\ncurrent long term studies suggest that fibrosis is a common\nfinding in late post-transplant biopsies, in these cases it does not\nappear to be related to the development of fatty liver disease.184 185\nLonger follow-up of patients who have become obese after LTwill\nprovide insights on the burden of de novo NASH.\nTRANSPLANTATION FOR NASHdTHE PATIENTS\u2019 PERSPECTIVE\nImproving awareness and reducing stigma\nPatient feedback suggests that opportunities for early interven\ufffetion and diagnosis in patients with key risk factors for NASH,\nsuch as obesity, DM and insulin resistance, are being missed,\nleading to unnecessary disease progression. Many patients also\nreport a degree of stigma associated with liver disease in the\npublic\u2019s perception. This can be very difficult for patients and\nfamilies to deal with and can make them feel very isolated.\nPatients, and in particular family members, say they would have\nliked to have been forewarned about the symptoms of advanced\nliver disease and not just been given information on the trans\ufffeplant process. Many mention hepatic encephalopathy as being\nparticularly distressing and feel that understanding the cause\nwould have reduced this distress.\nRecommendation 35: There is a need to increase under\ufffestanding of liver disease and its many causes, to improve patient\noutcomes and reduce the stigma many patients experience. (Not\ngraded).\nPatients diagnosed with NASH, particularly those who do not\nhave obvious symptoms of the metabolic syndrome, report\nconfusion or lack of information on their diagnosis, its cause and\nwhat they can do to manage and improve their condition. With\nappropriate advice, management and support, patients can make\nlifestyle changes, improve liver health and avoid transplantation.\nMany patients struggle to maintain lifestyle changes in the long\nterm. Many receive ongoing monitoring for clinical symptoms\nbut no support for maintaining lifestyle changes.\nSome patients believe they will be a \u2018different person\u2019 post\ufffetransplant and can find it difficult to come to terms with\nongoing health problems. Those who suffered from depression,\nstress or eating disorders prior to transplant can find themselves\nfalling back into old patterns.\nIt is important that patients understand the cardiovascular\nrisks associated with both NASH and LT and what they can do\nto reduce these. Family members have a key role in supporting\npatients pre- and post-transplant, particularly with under\ufffestanding and managing diet and being aware of symptoms. It is\nimportant that they are given information and involved in\ndecisions.\nRecommendation 36: The potential cardiovascular\nmorbidity associated with NASH should be discussed with\npatients and guidance given on diet and exercise, and sources of\nsupport (including psychological support) as part of ongoing\nmanagement.

Patients can\nfind it helpful to be put in touch with people who have previously\nbeen through the transplant experience, often as part of support\ngroups. People who receive a transplant say they struggle to put\ninto words the gratitude they feel towards the transplant team\nand the donor family. They therefore find it difficult to raise any\ncomplaints directly with the transplant team. Some patients (and\ntheir family members) have difficulty post-transplant in coming\nto terms with a transplanted organ.

            "response": "This article provides guidelines for managing patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) who are undergoing liver transplantation. Some key points include:\n\n1. Diagnosis: The diagnosis of NASH should be confirmed through a liver biopsy, and patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis should also be evaluated for the presence of NASH.\n\n2. Waitlist considerations: Patients with NASH should meet the same criteria for liver transplantation as those without NASH. However, their higher risk of cardiovascular disease should be taken into account, particularly regarding the need for invasive cardiac monitoring during the operation.\n\n3. Operating room environment: The operating room environment should be optimized to minimize exposure to environmental pollutants, which could exacerbate NASH.\n\n4. Postoperative management: Patients with NASH should receive close monitoring for signs of recurrent NASH, and efforts should be made to prevent obesity and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Statins should be continued during the postoperative phase, and patients should be encouraged to participate in exercise programs.\n\n5. Follow-up: Regular follow-up appointments should be scheduled to monitor for the development of graft fibrosis, and patients should be advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle to reduce the risk of recurrence.\n\nOverall, the guidelines emphasize the importance of careful screening, monitoring, and management of patients with NASH undergoing liver transplantation to improve outcomes and reduce the risk of complications.",

Heimbach, MD1\n1Department of Transplant Surgery, William J. von Liebig Transplant\nCenter, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota\nSemin Liver Dis 2020;40:358\u2013364.\nAddress for correspondence Julie Heimbach, MD, Department of\nTransplant Surgery, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, 200 First Street\nSW, Rochester, MN 55905 (e-mail: heimbach.julie@mayo.edu).\nThe incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increas\ufffeing worldwide, and is now the fifth most common tumor and\nthe third most common cause of cancer mortality.1 In the\nUnited States, mortality for HCC has increased faster than for\nany other tumor primarily due to cirrhosis from hepatitis C\nvirus as well as other etiologies such as alcohol, nonalcoholic\nfatty liver disease, and hepatitis B virus.2,3 The increased\nincidence of HCC combined with the demonstrated efficacy\nof liver transplantation (LT) for HCC treatment and a favor\ufffeable allocation policy have led to HCC being the most\ncommon indication for LT in the United States.4\nThis dramatic rise in transplantation for HCC is particularly\nremarkable considering that the early experience with LT for\nHCC produced such uniformly dismal results that in 1989 the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services listed HCC as a\ncontraindication for LT.5,6 The initial unfavorable outcomes of\nLT in the setting of HCC led to the conclusion that LT was not\nsuitable as a treatment for HCC, though this was largely due to\nthe use of LT as a \u201clast resort\u201d only for those with very extensive\ntumors. Patients undergoing LT for other indications who were\nfound to have incidental tumors demonstrated excellent sur\ufffevival rates, suggesting that patients with limited tumor burden\nmay benefit from LT. The landmark publication from Mazza\ufffeferro et al in 1996 demonstrated 83% recurrence-free survival\nand 75% actuarial survival at 4 years for patients undergoing LT\nfor HCC within specific criteria, clearly defining the essential\nrole of patient selection.7\nDue to these encouraging findings as well as validation\nfrom other reports,7\u20139 LTwas once again approved in the U.S.\nas a treatment option for patients with HCC, though access to\ntransplantation for patients with HCC was significantly\nlimited by the national organ allocation system, which prior\nto 2002 was based on waiting time and medical status. Since\nthat time, the field of HCC has evolved to include the option of\nliving donor LT (LDLT) for adults beginning in 1998, the\nadoption of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)-\nbased organ allocation system, as well as advancements in\nliver-directed therapies used as a bridge to transplantation or\nas primary therapy, and the approval of modestly effective\nsystemic therapies for advanced HCC.\nImportantly, in the U.S. from 2000 to 2002, HCC was one of\nthe most common indications for LDLT as there was no other\nviable option. However, while the use of LDLT for treatment\nof patients with HCC has continued to flourish around the\nKeywords\n\u25ba liver transplantation\n\u25ba hepatocellular\ncarcinoma\n\u25ba HCC\n\u25ba allocation\nAbstract Liver transplantation (LT) is an optimal treatment option for early-stage unresectable\nhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with cirrhosis as it provides a treatment for\nunderlying liver disease as well as a decreased incidence of recurrent cancer compared\nwith alternative treatment strategies. A primary barrier to LT for HCC is the critical\nshortage of available liver allografts. The system of prioritization and access to\ndeceased donor transplantation for patient with HCC in the United States has\ncontinued to evolve, while variable approaches including no additional priority, are\nin use around the world. While the Milan criteria remain the most well-established\npretransplantation selection criteria, multiple other algorithms which expand beyond\nMilan have been proposed. The current review focuses on liver allocation for HCC as\nwell as the principles and varied models available for pretransplant patient selection.\npublished online\nSeptember 17, 2020\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 by Thieme Medical\nPublishers, Inc., 333 Seventh Avenue,\nNew York, NY 10001, USA.\nTel: +1(212) 760-0888.\nDOI https://doi.org/\n10.1055/s-0040-1709492.\nISSN 0272-8087.\n358\nDownloaded by: NYU. Copyrighted material.\nArticle published online: 2020-09-17\n\nworld, most notably in Asia, the combination of a widely\npublished donor death and the adoption of the MELD system\nin 2002, which included an overprioritization for HCC\npatients, led to a marked reduction in the use of LDLT for\nHCC patients in the United States. Initial concern of an\nincreased risk of HCC recurrence in the setting of LDLT for\nHCC have instead been determined to be related to patient\nselection, and perhaps related to changes in organ allocation\npolicy as well as the ongoing critical organ shortage. LDLT is\nonce again rising in the U.S. both for patients with and\nwithout HCC.\nEvolution of Allocation Policy for Patients\nwith HCC\nThe MELD-based system for allocation of deceased donor\nlivers was adopted in the United States in 2002, and has been\nassociated with a decrease in waitlist mortality and an\nincrease in post-LT survival.10,11 This system was updated\nto include sodium in 2016, which has led to a further\ndecrease in waitlist mortality without any impact on post\ufffeLT survival12,13 Patients with HCC as well as other compli\ufffecations of cirrhosis and certain metabolic conditions have an\nincreased mortality risk (without access to timely LT) which\nis not predicted by their calculated MELD or MELD-Na score.\nTherefore, they are allowed to receive assigned MELD scores\n(commonly referred to as MELD exception scores). Since\ninception, the MELD system has continued to evolve through\nmultiple revisions as summarized in \u25baFig. 1.\nThe process of awarding exception scores for HCC in the\nUnited States is automated for patients whose tumors are\nwithin designated criteria. Historically, assigned MELD score\nexceptions started at a score intended to reflect a 15% risk of\nwaitlist drop out over a 3-month period, and this score in\ufffecreased every 3 months by a value anticipated to reflect a 10%\nincreased risk of mortality without transplantation. The initial\nscores of 24 for T1 and 28 for T2 were reduced twice as they\nawarded too much priority to HCC patients, relative to non-HCC\npatients.14,15 Until very recently, patients who presented with\nHCC beyond Milan criteria who were successfully downstaged\nby liver-directed therapy had to undergo an appeals process to a\nreview board.\nWhile this system of MELD score exceptions allowed access\nto LT for patients with HCC, several important issues arose.\nFirst, despite the two early downward adjustments of the initial\nassigned score, except in parts of the United States with the\nlongest wait times, patients with HCC exception scores still had\na markedly higher transplant rate and a significantly lower\nwaitlist dropout rate than nonexception patients, leading to a\nmajor disparity in access to transplant between patients in\nthe U.S. with and without HCC.16\u201318 Second, it was noted that\nthe median MELD score at the time of transplant continued to\nrise yearly in nearly every area of the country, and this \u201cMELD\ninflation\u201d was hypothesized to be related to the system of\nFig. 1 U.S. liver selection and allocation policy changes for hepatocellular carcinoma over time. \u0001\nChanges which have had the most significant\nimpact. T1/T2: T1 a single tumor 1\u20132 cm, and T2 1\u20132 tumors between 1 and 3 cm or 1 tumor 2\u20135 cm.

Copyrighted material.\n\nexception scores which created large concentrations of rela\ufffetively stable patients at specific score thresholds reflective of\nthe exception scores granted for patients every 3 months (22,\n25, 28, 29, etc.).19 Finally, it was noted that the regional review\nsystemwas highlyinconsistentin the approach to patientswith\nHCC outside of standard criteria, as well as for patients with\nother non\u2013policy-based MELD exception requests.20 These\nissues were some of the most important challenges to the U.S.\nsystem.\nBalancing Access for HCC and Non-HCC Patients\nThe issue of unequal access to LT for HCC and non-HCC\npatients is of particular importance given that this disparity\nis primarily a result of organ allocation policy. This differs\nfrom the critical shortage in available deceased donor organs\noverall, which relates a shortage of donors relative to the\nnumber of potential recipients. Allocation policy in the\nUnited States begins with the organ-specific committees of\nthe Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network\n(OPTN), which are made up of volunteer representatives of\nthe transplant community from around the country, and\nafter an extensive process of statistical modeling, gathering\npublic feedback, and subsequent revision, the final policy is\nultimately determined by the governing board of the OPTN,\nwhich is also made up of representatives of the transplant\ncommunity as well as the public.\nThe overprioritization for HCC patients was addressed by\nthe \u201ccap and delay\u201d policy revision, which after favorable\nmodeling, was adopted in 2015.21 This revision added a 6-\nmonth waiting period before patients could be transplanted\nbased on their assigned HCC exception score, though the\nscore granted after 6 months was MELD 28 (the same as they\nwould have had after waiting 6 months under the prior\nsystem). This avoided further disadvantaging patients wait\ufffeing in high MELD regions, yet allowed for biologic selection\nby essentially mimicking what was already happening in the\nhigher MELD areas where the transplant rates between HCC\nand non-HCC patients were noted to be more similar. By\nprolonging the waiting time, tumors with poor biology will\nbe identified and futile transplantation may be reduced, as\nsupported by an analysis of U.S. data by Halazun et al\ndemonstrating worse outcomes for HCC patients trans\ufffeplanted in U.S. regions with very short waiting times com\ufffepared with regions with long wait times.22 A recent analysis\nof transplant rates for HCC and non-HCC patients in the U.S.\nin the 2 years just prior to and just after the policy change\ndetermined that HCC candidates had a 37% lower risk of\nwaitlist mortality/dropout prepolicy and a comparable risk\nof mortality/dropout postpolicy, and concluded that the\nrevised policy established equity between HCC and non\ufffeHCC waitlist candidates.23\nImproved Standardization for HCC Exception Patients\nAddressing the issues of MELD inflation and inconsistent\napproaches by regional review boards for HCC and non-HCC\npatients required a more significant change. First, a national\npolicy to address patients who initially presented with HCC\nbeyond the Milan criteria but who were successfully down\ufffesized to within Milan criteria was implemented in December\nof 2017. This change adopted the downstaging criteria\ninitially proposed by University of California San Francisco\n(UCSF) to define the allowable tumor burden prior to down\ufffestaging treatment (1 lesion between 5 and 8 cm, 2\u20133 lesions\nwith at least one greater than 3 cm though none greater than\n5 cm and sum of all less than 8 cm, 4\u20135 lesions all less than\n3 cm and sum less than 8 cm), as well as a cap on the\nmaximum \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP) at 1,000 ng/mL, creating a\nconsistent national downstaging policy for these patients.\nBoth changes were adopted to factor biologic behavior in the\nprediction of both waitlist and post-LT outcomes.\nSecond, in May of 2019, a National Liver Review Board\n(NLRB) was adopted, changing the regional review board\nsystem of exception review to a national review system. The\nmain goal was to improve consistency around the U.S.,\nmaking things more equitable for patients and addressing\nconcerns that some areas had more liberal acceptance of\nnon\u2013policy-based exception requests. A secondary purpose\nwas to improve efficiency. The newly adopted NLRB has three\ndistinct boards, including one specifically to handle HCC\nexception requests which do not meet policy criteria. Guid\ufffeance documents addressing the most common non\u2013policy\ufffebased exception requests were created for all three boards to\nprovide criteria to guide the board and centers when consid\ufffeering or preparing non\u2013policy-based exception requests.\nTo address the conundrum of how to set a national score in\nthe setting of marked regional differences in the score\nrequired to access transplant across the U.S., as well as\nconcern over the previously described \u201cMELD inflation,\u201d a\nfixed score set 3 points below the median score required to\naccess transplantation in the area of distribution where the\ncandidate is listed (MMaT-3) was adopted with the adoption\nof the NLRB. The new exception score does not increase every\n3 months, but remains a fixed score, so that allocation for\nexception patients relies on time waiting with approved\nexception. This is in contrast to the prior elevator system\nwhich also relied heavily on time waiting, but allowed\npatients with exceptions to be transplanted at a significantly\nhigher rate than non-exception patients as previously noted.\nThe median MELD is recalculated every 6 months using the\nprevious 12 months of data and scores are subsequently\nadjusted. The primary goal of the use of MMaT is to assign a\nscore that is adjusted based on the score required to access\ntransplant in the area where the patient is waiting, given\nthere are differences around the U.S. in the median score\nrequired to access to transplant, while secondary goals are to\ncontinue to address overprioritization of HCC patients\n(though this may have been largely addressed by the cap\nand delay policy adopted in 2015) and to ameliorate MELD\ninflation. While data on how this system may perform is not\nyet available, based on modeling, it is anticipated that this\nmay lead to at least stabilization of the median MELD score\nand potentially a decrease, as well as standardize the ap\ufffeproach to exception patients. Importantly, similar to prior\npolicy changes, it is possible that further adjustments to the\nassigned score of MMaT -3 (either lower or higher) may be\nneeded to achieve better parity with nonexception patients.\nSeminars in Liver Disease Vol. 40 No. 4/2020\n360 Evolution of Liver Transplant Selection Criteria and U.S. Allocation Policy Heimbach\nDownloaded by: NYU. Copyrighted material.\n\nThe current system for HCC patient selection and organ\nallocation is summarized in \u25baTable 1.\nIn addition to the major changes impacting patient selec\ufffetion and organ allocation policy for HCC highlighted earlier,\nmore modest but still important policy changes have also\noccurred as noted in \u25baFig. 1. The adoption of a standardized\npathology form provided required elements including the\nsize, location, number, and grade of HCC lesions found in the\nexplant which are reported using a standardized format,\nwhich allows for improved documentation and interpreta\ufffetion as well as data which can be used to guide future policy\nrevision. Adoption of standardized imaging criteria to ensure\ncenters were following a minimum acceptable standard for\nthe noninvasive diagnosis of HCC was also necessary to\nensure that patients had findings that would justify addi\ufffetional waitlist prioritization.\nOther options for addressing access to transplantation for\npatients with HCC have been adopted around the world. For\nexample, in the U.K., a benefit model was adopted in 2018\nwhich gives priority to urgent cases as well as to those with\nthe highest anticipated benefit from transplant based on a\nformula combining multiple donor and recipient param\ufffeeters, including the recipient diagnosis of HCC.24 The Trans\ufffeplant Benefit concept ranks candidates by combining the\nprinciples of both urgency and utility. Importantly, the\nperiod of time over which benefit is measured will impact\nthe allocation, as a longer time will favor younger candidates\nand a shorter time will favor older candidates, provided they\nhave a higher waitlist mortality. There are also considerable\nchallenges to the identification of pretransplant factors\nbeyond age which may reliably predict long-term posttrans\ufffeplant outcome, and thus, the model adopted by the U.K. will\nsurely provide valuable guidance and insight into the feasi\ufffebility of a more widespread adoption of a benefit-based\nsystem.25 Euro-transplant utilizes a MELD-based system\nwith additional exception points awarded for HCC and\nincreased every 90 days; Italy uses a MELD-based system\nwith additional HCC points at the time of listing, while\nFrance uses a system which incorporates AFP and requires\nHCC treatment.26,27 While a thorough discussion of the\nevolution of HCC allocation around the world is beyond\nthe scope of the review, it is essential to know that there\nare multiple approaches utilized by countries around the\nworld with varied degrees of overlap, each typically relying\non the assessment of tumor biology by the use of tumor size,\nnumber of nodules, biomarkers, or/and response to therapy\nwith perhaps the one common theme being all systems\nrequire ongoing monitoring and revision.\nSelection Criteria for Liver Transplantation\nfor HCC\nJust as the system for allocation of livers for patients with\nHCC has evolved, so too has the criteria by which patients\nwith HCC are selected, and the most common selection\ncriteria are summarized in \u25baTable 2. As described above,\nin the U.S. those presenting within the Milan criteria as well\nas those who are initially outside of Milan but who undergo\nsuccessful downstaging to within Milan are eligible for an\nassigned MELD exception score and access to deceased donor\ntransplantation. This modest expansion beyond the Milan\ncriteria was based on the observation that excellent out\ufffecomes can be achieved with LT for HCC both for those within\nMilan and for a subset of patients beyond Milan criteria. One\nof the earliest to be developed is the UCSF criteria, in which\npatients with a single lesion up to 6.5 cm, or up to 3 lesions\nnone greater than 4.5 and a total tumor burden < 8 cm were\ndemonstrated to have outcomes equivalent to those within\nthe Milan criteria, with approximately 80% survival at 5 years,\nthough another reports from centers outside of UCSF have\nnot had as favorable results.28,29\nIn addition to the Milan and UCSF criteria, several other\nsystems have been proposed for pretransplant selection for\npatients with HCC (see \u25baTable 2). The overall principal\nunderlying the drive for expanded criteria is well-captured\nby the \u201cMetroticket\u201d concept, again by the group in Milan,\nwhich recognizes that transplanting patients with more ad\ufffevanced tumors does impact posttransplant outcome, in a\nstepwise and potentially predictable way such that \u201cprice\u201d\nthat is paid in terms of HCC recurrence and inferior outcomes\nor reduced access to transplantation for other non-HCC\npatients is proportionate to how far beyond standard HCC\nselection criteria the system is willing to go (the up-to-seven\ncriteria\u2014the sum of thelargest tumor in cm plus the number of\ntumors is  7).30 The recently published Metroticket 2.0 uses a\nmodel based on level of AFP, tumor size, and tumor number\nTable 1 U.S. selection and allocation for HCC in 2020\nSelection for automatic exception score:\n\u2022 AFP < 1,000 ng/mL.

After 6-month wait, patients are awarded a fixed\nscore of 3 points lower than Median MELD at Transplan\ufffetation (MMaT-3) for patients transplanted within the area\nof distribution where the candidate is listed (distribution is\na concentric circle model as of February 4, 2020.)

Copyrighted material.\n\nwhich was intended to achieve at least 70% tumor-specific\n5-year survival. For patients with an AFP < 200 ng/mL, the sum\nof the number of tumors and size in cm should be less than 7,\nwhile for AFP 200 to 400 ng/mL, the sum of tumor number plus\nsize should be  5, and if thelevel of AFP is 400 to 1,000 ng/mL,\nthe sum of the number and size of tumors should be  4. This\nmodel was developed with multi-institution data from Italy\nand validated in a population from China.31\nOther proposed systems also use a biologiccomponent to the\nscore, and generally, the size of the largest lesion is the compo\ufffenent with the strongest prognostic role. Toso et al proposed a\nsystem using a population of HCC patients from Canada and\nSwitzerland based on total tumor volume < 115 cm3 and\nAFP < 400 ng/mL, while French have proposed and validated\nin Italy a system including AFP, as well as number and size of\nnodules, with each variable being assigned a specific number of\npoints between 0 and 4, and those with 2 or less points being\nconsidered low-risk.32,33 The primary difference of these two\nmodels compared with either the Milan criteria or the UCSF\ncriteria is the use of AFP, which was independently predictive of\nworse outcomes even for patients within Milan criteria. A\ncontinuous risk score, Hazard Associated with Liver Transplan\ufffetation for HCC has also been developed and validated in an\ninternational cohort, and includes AFP and tumor burden, plus\nMELD-Na, and they have recently published a larger applica\ufffetion.34TheKyoto criteriainclude a restriction on totalnumber of\ntumors ( 10) as well as size of the largest tumor ( 5 cm) and\ndes-gamma-carboxy-prothrombin < 400 mAU/mL, and for\nthose within these criteria, a remarkably low recurrence rate\nof just 4% at 5 years is reported though the number meeting\nthese criteria in this study was just 147 out of a total of 198.35\nRecently, investigators have also proposed the use of machine\nlearning decision tree techniques to optimize selection criteria\nboth for HCC and non-HCC patients based on a large number of\nvariables for waitlisted and transplanted patients already col\ufffelectedin OPTN data from 2002 to 2016 to developmore accurate\nprediction of 3-month risk of waitlist dropout due to death or\nbecoming unsuitable for transplantation. Perhaps not surpris\ufffeingly, the same variables of tumor number, size, and AFP are also\npart of this system.36\nConclusion and Future Directions\nWhile the advantages of LT for HCC include excellentlong-term\ndisease-free survival as well as treatment of underlying cir\uffferhosis, a primary disadvantage especially for patients who do\nnot have a potential living donor option, is the critical shortage\nof available deceased organs, leading for the need for an\nallocation system as well as the need to carefully select which\nHCC patients are most likely to benefit from transplantation.\nRegardless of whether the system is a MELD-based system\nwith exceptions for patients with HCC within specific criteria\nas in the U.S., or a different system, there will be need to\nbalance the risk of disease progression and potential for\nwaitlist drop out for both HCC and non-HCC patients. The\nmost essential step for the future following any organ alloca\ufffetion or distribution policy change is an objective, efficient, and\ncollaborative effort by the transplant community to optimize\nTable 2 Liver transplant selection criteria used for patients with HCC (adopted from Santopaolo et al)37\nSelection system Year\nproposed\nCriteria Pros/cons\nMilan criteria 1996 Single nodule < 5 cm or up to 3 lesions\nnone larger than 3 cm, no macrovascular\ninvasion\nGold-standard.

The most recent changes in the U.S. have been\nsignificant both for HCC and non-HCC patients andwill require\nadditional and likely ongoing revision such as adjusting the\nsize of the distribution circles according to population density,\nor determining whether MMaT-3 is the optimal prioritization\nfor HCC, or if it should be raised or lowered. It would be ideal if\nupdated analysis tools could be developed, potentially using\nartificial intelligence or machine learning to facilitate such\nefforts. If instead of optimizing the newly developed system,\nthe community is instead directed to embark on the develop\ufffement of an entirely new system, such as the borderless\nallocation model, in addition to the risk of further discord\nwithin the transplant community, there is also a risk that\npatients will be subjected to a nonoptimized allocation system\nfor a prolonged period while a new system is developed.\nConflicts of Interest\nNone declared.\nReferences\n1 World Health Organization.

            "response": "This article discusses the evolution of liver transplant selection criteria and the US allocation policy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It highlights the historical background of liver transplantation for HCC, starting with the pioneering work of Starzl and colleagues in the late 1960s. The article explains the development of the Milan criteria, which became the gold standard for selecting patients with HCC for liver transplantation, and the subsequent relaxation of these criteria due to advances in surgical techniques and improved understanding of tumor biology. The article also describes the introduction of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scoring system, which prioritizes patients based on their severity of liver disease rather than tumor stage, and its impact on access to liver transplantation for patients with HCC. The article then discusses the challenges posed by the critical shortage of donor livers and the resulting inequities in access to liver transplantation for patients with HCC, especially in the US. It explains the measures taken to address these challenges, including the \"cap and delay\" policy, which adds a six-month waiting period for patients with HCC who exceed the Milan criteria, and the creation of a national liver review board to replace the previous regional review boards. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for continued efforts to balance access to liver transplantation for patients with HCC and non-HCC patients, and to ensure fairness and consistency in the allocation process. Overall, the article provides a comprehensive overview of the history and current state of liver transplant selection criteria and allocation policies for patients with HCC, highlighting the key milestones and challenges along the way.",

Proportion of liver transplants for HCV associated liver\ndisease and HCC has since decreased to 18.7% in 2019 compared with 44.5% in 2010\n[25.8%, (95% CI 24.3% to 27.3%), p<0.001], while liver transplants for liver disease and\nHCC associated with alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) and non-alcoholic fatty liver\ndisease (NAFLD) increased from 12.7% to 28.8% [16.1%, (95% CI 14.8% to 17.4%),\np<0.001], and from 9.1% to 21.5% [12.4%, (95% CI 11.2% to 13.5%), p<0.001], respec\ufffetively. When all causes of liver disease were examined, only 1.7% of liver transplants had\nunspecified causes. The five major causes of liver disease and HCC among men receiving\nliver transplants in 2019 were ALD (33.1%), HCV (21.9%), NAFLD (18.5%), cholestatic liver\ndisease (5.7%) and hepatitis B (4.9%), while the major causes among women were NAFLD\n(26.8%), ALD (21.1%), HCV (13.1%), cholestatic liver disease (11.1%), and autoimmune\nliver disease (5.6%).\nPLOS ONE\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239393 September 18, 2020 1 / 14\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Wang S, Toy M, Hang Pham TT, So S\n(2020) Causes and trends in liver disease and\nhepatocellular carcinoma among men and women\nwho received liver transplants in the U.S., 2010-\n2019.

This trend has been attributed to the introduction of curative directing acting\nantiviral treatment for hepatitis C, alcohol abuse, and the rising obesity epidemic in the coun\ufffetry [6]. However, a complete analysis of all causes of liver disease and HCC among adult liver\ntransplant recipients in the U.S. has not been reported. In 2020, the Organ Procurement and\nTransplant Network (OPTN) reported that the major indication for liver transplants in 2018\nwas for other/unknown causes [7], accounting for 33.9% of liver transplants. Although unsub\ufffestantiated, this has led to speculation that many in the other/unknown category represent\npatients with NAFLD [8]. Liver transplants for HCC were also frequently reported as a sepa\uffferate category and not under the liver disease causing HCC. This leads to an undercount of the\nactual burden of the underlying etiology of liver disease treated by liver transplantation. The\npurpose of this study is to conduct an in-depth analysis of all causes of liver disease and their\nassociated complications including HCC among liver transplants recipients from 2010 to\n2019.\nMaterials and methods\nThe data for this analysis was obtained from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Net\ufffework (OPTN) STAR database, a national database operated by the United Network of Organ\nSharing (UNOS) under contract with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that\ncontains all the data in the U.S. on organ transplantation including waiting list, organ dona\ufffetion, and transplantation. All the data contained in the OPTN database are fully anonymized\nand the authors had no access to any identifying information. The study cohort included all\nthe adult patients aged 18 years and older (66,719) who received liver transplants between Jan\ufffeuary 1, 2010 and December 31, 2019. The causes of liver disease (S1 Table) were categorized by\ncombining the diagnoses entered into the database as primary and secondary diagnoses at ini\ufffetial waitlist registration, final diagnosis entered at time of transplant, and positive serology for\nhepatitis B (hepatitis B surface antigen, HBsAg) and hepatitis C (hepatitis C antibody). When\nthere was more than one diagnosis, the cause of liver disease was categorized by prioritizing\nthe final diagnosis at time of transplant, then primary diagnosis at time of waitlist registration,\nthen secondary diagnosis at time of waitlist registration. The cause of liver disease was catego\uffferized under HCV and hepatitis B if the patients were hepatitis C antibody positive and hepati\ufffetis B surface antigen positive, respectively. The etiology of HCC was based on the liver diseases\nlisted as primary or secondary diagnoses at waitlist, final diagnosis at time of transplant, and\nserology for hepatitis B and C. HCC and cryptogenic cirrhosis were only listed as separate cate\ufffegories when there was no known associated liver disease. Recipients who had no diagnosis\ninformation in the database were grouped under a category named \u2018unspecified cause\u2019.\nPLOS ONE\nCauses and trends in liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239393 September 18, 2020 2 / 14\nFunding: All the funding and support for this study\nis provided by the Asian Liver Center, Department\nof Surgery, Stanford University School of Medicine.\nThere was no additional external funding received\nfor this study.\nCompeting interests: The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist\nAbbreviations: ALD, alcohol associated liver\ndisease (non-HCV related); BMI, body mass index;\nHBV, hepatitis B; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma;\nHCV, hepatitis C; LT, liver transplant; NAFLD, non\ufffealcoholic fatty liver disease; OPTN, Organ\nProcurement and Transplant Network.\n\nRecipients were analyzed by gender to assess trends in liver transplants and whether there\nwere different disease burdens resulting in liver transplantation between men and women, and\nBMI at time of waitlist registration to assess the potential effect of the obesity epidemic.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using SAS v9.4 software. Differences between the propor\ufffetions of liver transplant performed each year for the various causes of liver disease compared\nwith 2010 were calculated using a Z-test for two proportions. P-values and related confidence\nintervals (CIs) were reported accordingly. Linear regression analysis was conducted in SAS for\ntrend over ten years, and the p-values and parameter estimates were reported accordingly.\nResults\nTrends in etiology of liver disease and HCC among adult liver transplant\nrecipients from 2010 to 2019\nThe number of adult liver transplants per year has steadily increased from 5,731 in 2010 to\n8,345 in 2019 (45.6% increase). Between 2010 and 2019, proportion of liver transplant recipi\ufffeents with BMI \ufffd 30 has increased from 37.0% to 40.8% [3.8%, (95% CI 2.2% to 5.4%),\np<0.001], and proportion of recipients with BMI \ufffd 35 has increased from 13.8% to 16.7%\n[2.9%, (95% CI 1.7% to 4.1%), p<0.001] (Table 1).\nAmong adults who received liver transplants in 2019, the number and proportion of liver\ntransplants by etiology of liver disease and HCC in descending order of frequency were alco\ufffehol-associated liver disease (2,399 or 28.8%), NAFLD (1,795 or 21.5%), HCV (1,563 or 18.7%),\ncholestatic liver disease (641 or 7.7%), hepatitis B with or without hepatitis C or hepatitis D\ncoinfection (355 or 4.3%), cryptogenic cirrhosis (259 or 3.1%), autoimmune liver disease (234\nor 2.8%), metabolic liver disease (243 or 2.9%), acute hepatic necrosis unrelated to hepatitis B\nor hepatitis C (169 or 2.1%), unspecified causes of HCC (132 or 1.6%), graft failure (142 or\n1.7%), benign hepatic tumors (103 or 1.2%), non-HCC malignant liver tumors (93 or 1.1%),\nBudd-Chiari syndrome (30 or 0.4%), miscellaneous causes (32 or 0.4%), and unspecified\ncauses (145 or 1.7%) (Table 1).\nThe proportion of liver transplants for hepatitis C has declined significantly. Although hep\ufffeatitis C associated liver disease and HCC was the leading cause of liver transplants from 2010\nto 2017, it dropped to number two behind alcohol associated liver disease in 2018 and to num\ufffeber three behind NAFLD among the most common causes of liver transplants in 2019.\nBetween 2010 and 2019, the proportion of liver transplants for hepatitis C associated liver dis\ufffeease and HCC declined by more than half from 44.5% to 18.7% [25.8%, (95% CI 24.3% to\n27.3%), p<0.001].\nDuring the same period, the proportions of liver transplants for liver disease and HCC\nrelated to ALD and NAFLD have doubled from 12.7% to 28.8% [16.1%, (95% CI 14.8% to\n17.4%), p<0.001], and from 9.1% to 21.5% [12.4%, (95% CI 11.2% to 13.5%), p<0.001],\nrespectively. Proportion of liver transplants for graft failure and benign hepatic tumors have\nalso increased from 0.2% to 1.7% [1.5%, (95% CI 1.2% to 1.8%), p<0.001] and from 0.7% to\n1.2% [0.5%, (95% CI 0.2% to 0.8%), p = 0.003] respectively (Table 1).\nBetween 2010 and 2019, the proportions of liver transplants for hepatitis B associated liver\ndisease and HCC decreased from 5.7% to 4.3% [1.4%, (95% CI 0.7% to 2.2%), p<0.001], cryp\ufffetogenic cirrhosis from 4.7% to 3.1% [1.6%, (95% CI 0.9% to 2.3%), p<0.001], acute hepatic\nnecrosis unrelated to hepatitis B or C from 3.1% to 2.1% [1.0%, (95% CI 0.5% to 1.6%),\np<0.001], and unspecified causes of liver disease or cirrhosis from 3% to 1.7% [1.3%, (95% CI\nPLOS ONE\nCauses and trends in liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239393 September 18, 2020 3 / 14\n\n0.8% to 1.8%), p<0.001]. There were no changes in the proportion of liver transplants for liver\ndisease and HCC associated with cholestatic liver disease, autoimmune liver disease, metabolic\nliver disease, unspecified causes of HCC, other malignant liver tumors, Budd-Chiari syn\ufffedrome, and miscellaneous causes from 2010 to 2019 (Table 1).\nIn a linear regression analysis, the major changes in the trend in the causes of liver disease\nand HCC among adult transplant recipients between 2010 and 2019 were proportions of liver\ntransplants for HCV (-2.98 [95% CI -3.85 to -2.11]), ALD (1.81 [95% CI 1.35 to 2.27]), and\nNAFLD (1.49 [95% CI 1.28 to 1.70]) (Table 2).

(Table 4)\nSimilar to the trend seen in men, there was a significant decrease in proportion of liver\ntransplants in women for hepatitis C-associated liver disease and HCC from 35% in 2010 to\n13.1% in 2019 [21.9%, (95% CI 19.5% to 24.3%), p<0.001], whereas the proportions of liver\ntransplants for liver disease and HCC associated with NAFLD and ALD more than doubled\nfrom 11.9% to 26.8% [14.9%, (95% CI 13.3% to 16.5%), p<0.001] and from9.2% to 21.1%\n[11.9%, (95% CI 10.5% to 13.3%), p<0.001], respectively (Table 4). In 2017 NAFLD surpassed\nhepatitis C as the leading cause of liver disease in women receiving liver transplants, and in\n2019 alcohol-associated liver disease surpassed HCV to become the second major cause of\nliver transplants in women. Among women who received liver transplants in 2019, the five\nleading causes of liver disease in decreasing order of frequency were liver disease and HCC\nassociated with NAFLD, alcohol associated liver disease, hepatitis C, cholestatic liver disease,\nand autoimmune liver disease (Table 4).\nEtiology of HCC among adult liver transplant recipients between 2010 and\n2019\nFrom January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019, 19,872 (31%) adult liver transplant recipients\nwere diagnosed with HCC (S3 Table). From 2010 to 2019, the proportion of transplant recipi\ufffeents with HCC decreased from 33% to 29% in men [4.3%, 95% CI (2.4% to 6.2%), p<0.001]\nand from 20% to 15.5% in women [4.5%, 95% CI (2.9% to 6.1%), p<0.001]. Hepatitis C\nremained the leading cause of HCC, although it has declined from 67.8% in 2010 to 43.8%\n[24.0%, (95% CI 20.8% to 27.1%), p<0.001] in 2019. Liver transplants for HCC related to hepa\ufffetitis B have seen no significant change. During the same period, liver transplants for HCC\nrelated to NAFLD and alcohol associated liver disease have both increased from 5.0% to 18.8%\n[13.8%, (95% CI 11.8% to 15.8%), p<0.001], and from 7.0% to 15.8% [8.8%, (95% CI 6.8% to\n10.8%), p<0.001], respectively. Between 2010 and 2019, there were no significant changes in\nthe proportion of liver transplants for HCC related to cholestatic liver disease (1.9%), crypto\ufffegenic cirrhosis (2.0%), autoimmune cirrhosis (1.0%), metabolic disease (1.0%), and Budd\ufffeChiari (0.2%) (Table 5).\nWhen analyzed by gender, hepatitis C remained the leading cause of HCC in both men and\nwomen who received liver transplants although it has dropped from 68.3% to 46.0% [22.3%,\n(95% CI 18.7% to 25.9%), p<0.001] in men and from 66.4% to 36.7% [29.7%, (95% CI 23.2%\nto 35.9%), p<0.001] in women between 2010 and 2019. In 2019, the second most common\ncause of HCC was ALD in men (19%), but in women it was NAFLD (30%). In women, ALD\nwas not a common cause of HCC accounting for only 7.0% of liver transplants for HCC in\n2019 (Table 5).\nPLOS ONE\nCauses and trends in liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239393 September 18, 2020 7 / 14\n\nDiscussion\nThe major indication for liver transplantation in 2018 was listed as other/unknown causes\n(33.9%) in the 2020 Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) Report [7]. But in\nthis study, when all causes of liver disease and HCC were examined by compiling all the diag\ufffenosis and HBV and HCV serologic data entries in the OPTN STAR database from time of ini\ufffetial waitlist registration to time of transplantation, we found only a very small proportion\n(1.7%) of liver transplant in adults had unknown causes of liver disease in 2018 and 2019.\nOur study found that although hepatitis C related liver disease and HCC was the leading\ncause for liver transplants in the U.S. and accounted for half of liver transplants in men and a\nthird of the liver transplants in women between 2010 to 2014, there has been a dramatic and\nsustained decline since then.

The decline was even greater for hep\ufffeatitis C without associated HCC (S4 Table). The declining numbers and proportions of liver\ntransplants for liver disease and HCC associated with hepatitis C is in concordance with the\nreports of a similar decrease in proportion of patients with hepatitis C enrolled on the liver\ntransplant waitlist [5]. This decline in liver transplant for hepatitis C complication is contem\ufffeporaneously associated with increased screening and the introduction of the highly effective,\ncurative direct acting antiviral therapies for hepatitis C [6]. There was also a decrease in the\nproportion of liver transplants for liver disease and HCC related to hepatitis B between 2010\nand 2019. This may, likewise, be attributed to antiviral therapy and screening programs for\nchronic hepatitis B.\nWith the decline in liver transplants for HCV, the proportion of liver transplants for liver\ndisease and HCC associated with NAFLD has more than doubled from 7.6% to 18.5% in men,\nand from 11.9% to 26.8% in women between 2010 and 2019. In 2017, NAFLD surpassed hepa\ufffetitis C as the leading etiology of liver disease among women who received liver transplants and\nremained the third most common etiology of liver disease among men who received liver\ntransplants. The increase in liver transplant for NAFLD is associated with a growing obesity\ncrisis [6]. Between 2010 and 2019, proportion of male transplant recipients who were severely\nobese (BMI \ufffd 35) increased from 12.4% to 15.7%, and from 16.5% to 18.4% in women. Past\nstudies have suggested that many transplant recipients with cryptogenic cirrhosis may repre\ufffesent uncounted cases of NAFLD [9, 10] and should be included as a part of the NAFLD cohort.\nWe found among the 259 (3.1% of total) transplants for cryptogenic cirrhosis in 2019, only 32\n(12.4%) recipients had a BMI \ufffd 35, and among the 145 (1.7% of total) transplants with unspec\ufffeified liver disease, only 6 (4.1%) had a BMI \ufffd 35. Therefore, they would be unlikely contribute\nto a significant increase in cases of NAFLD. Liver transplants for liver disease and HCC associ\ufffeated with NAFLD will likely continue to grow as a result of the high prevalence of severe and\nmorbid obesity in the U.S. population.

ALD\nhas become the leading indication for liver transplants in men and the second major indica\ufffetion for liver transplants in women in 2019. This trend is associated with the rising alcohol use\nin the U.S. population [12, 13]. Although men are traditionally heavier drinkers than women,\nalcohol consumption is rising in women as well. The National Epidemiologic Survey on Alco\ufffehol and Related Conditions reported increases in alcohol use especially among women in addi\ufffetion to older adults and racial/ethnic minorities [14, 15]. The increase in liver transplants for\nALD has also been attributed to broader acceptance of alcoholic liver disease for liver trans\ufffeplants and the relaxation of the mandatory six-month abstinence period prior to transplanta\ufffetion by many transplant centers across the country [16]. Although our study included\ntransplant recipients with HCC or cirrhosis (without HCC) under the same underlying etiol\ufffeogy (Tables 1\u20133), a similar trend in liver transplants for HCV, ALD and NAFLD was found in\nboth recipients without HCC and recipients with HCC (S4 Table).\nHCC is a common indication for liver transplantation, although it has declined from 33%\nto 29% of the transplants in men, and from 20% to 15% among women who received liver\ntransplants between 2010 and 2019. Hepatitis C was the most common cause of HCC among\nliver transplant recipients, but it has decreased from 68.3% to 46.0% in men and from 66.4% to\n36.7% in women between 2010 and 2019. The proportion of liver transplants for HCC caused\nby ALD has increased by 130% in men (from 8.2% to 18.5%) between 2010 and 2019, although\nit remained a less common cause of HCC in women. Proportion of liver transplants for HCC\ncaused by NAFLD showed the greatest increase from 4.4% to 15.4% in men and from 6.9% to\n29.7% in women between 2010 and 2019. Our findings are consistent with a recent study that\nin the first quarter of 2019, NASH has surpassed HCV (including HCV+ALD) among women\nwith HCC on the liver transplant waitlist, but HCV remained the major etiology among men\nwith HCC on the liver transplant waitlist in 2019 [5]. Hepatitis B was the second most com\ufffemon cause of HCC in men and women in 2010, but has since dropped to fourth in men and\nthird in women.\nBetween 2010 and 2019, there was a decrease in the proportions of liver transplants for\nacute hepatic necrosis (unrelated to hepatitis B or C), cryptogenic cirrhosis and in the category\nof unspecified diagnosis. Although the reason for the decrease in acute hepatic necrosis is\nunclear, the latter two decreasing trends likely reflect better diagnosis and coding entries into\nthe UNOS database. There were also increases in liver transplants for graft failure and benign\nhepatic tumors that were not been previously reported. In the past 10 years, there were no sig\ufffenificant changes in the proportions of liver transplants for cholestatic liver disease, autoim\ufffemune liver disease, metabolic liver disease, unspecified causes of HCC, other malignant\ntumors, Budd-Chiari, and in the several diseases we placed in the miscellaneous category.\nFrom 2010 to 2019, about 75% of liver transplants in adults and 87% of liver transplants for\nHCC each year were performed for complications of largely preventable or treatable causes\n(hepatitis C and hepatitis B, alcohol associated liver disease, and NAFLD). A public health\nresponse to improve awareness, prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment is much needed to\nhelp to reduce and eliminate the burden of liver disease and HCC caused by these four dis\ufffeeases. Hepatitis C is an example of what can be achieved through a national public health cam\ufffepaign. Once the most common indication accounting for almost half of liver transplants each\nyear, the continued decline in the number and proportion of men and women transplanted or\non the transplant waitlist for hepatitis C demonstrates that with a national campaign to\nPLOS ONE\nCauses and trends in liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239393 September 18, 2020 10 / 14\n\nincrease hepatitis C screening and treatment, it is feasible to eliminate or reduce its complica\ufffetions and the need for transplantation. Continued declines in liver transplants for HCC related\ncomplications can occur by implementing the 2020 US Preventive Services Task Force\n(USPSTP) recommendations for universal screening, preventing new infections through harm\nreduction and needle exchange, and widening access to direct acting antiviral treatment by\neliminating fibrosis restrictions [17\u201320]. Although a decrease in transplants for hepatitis B was\nseen, there was no change in transplants for HCC associated with hepatitis B. The risks of hep\ufffeatitis B progression to HCC and cirrhosis can likewise be combated through hepatitis B immu\ufffenization, public health campaigns to increase screening of at-risk populations including high\nprevalence foreign-born persons (according to USPSTF recommendations), and long-term\ndisease monitoring and antiviral treatment [21\u201323]. The rising trend in liver transplants for\nNAFLD and alcohol-associated liver disease is concerning. Since there is no targeted pharma\ufffecological treatment for NAFLD [24], public health campaigns to promote healthy eating and\nexercise beginning from early childhood, and increased participation of healthcare providers\nin obesity screening and behavioral counselling are necessary to decrease risk of NAFLD com\ufffeplications [25\u201327]. Likewise, interventions to reduce alcohol consumption including aware\ufffeness campaigns and regulation of advertising and pricing, alcohol misuse screenings, and\nclinical interventions [28] are needed to reduce the future burden of end stage liver disease\nand HCC caused by alcohol associated liver disease.\nStrength and limitations\nWhile prior studies frequently reported HCC as a separate category and not under the liver dis\ufffeease that caused HCC or have focused on hepatitis C, NAFLD or ALD among patients on the\nwaitlist for liver transplant, this is the only study that analyzed all causes of liver disease and\nHCC among adults who received liver transplants. The limitations of our study include that we\nrestricted our analysis to transplant recipients, so our study does not reflect overall numbers\nand prevalence of these liver conditions among patients on the transplant waiting list. In addi\ufffetion, while we tried our best to categorize patients into disease categories, a small number of\npatients where multiple conditions were present, we included them only under their primary\ndiagnosis. We are further limited by the accuracy of data entry and availability of information\nrecorded in the database\u2013for instance we lacked information on metabolic syndrome and risk\nfactors of NAFLD. Despite these limitations, our study provides the first complete analysis of all\ncauses of liver disease among liver transplant recipients between 2010 and 2019.\nConclusions\nWhen all causes of liver disease and HCC were examined, the proportion of liver transplants\nfor unspecified indications in 2019 was only 1.7%. About 75% of liver transplants in adults and\n87% of liver transplants for HCC each year were performed for complications of largely pre\ufffeventable or treatable diseases (hepatitis C and B, alcohol associated liver disease and NAFLD),\nunderlying the importance of public health interventions in raising awareness, prevention,\nearly diagnosis and treatment to prevent disease progression to end stage liver disease and\nHCC. The decline in liver transplantation for HCV demonstrates the feasibility to reduce the\nburden of end stage liver disease caused by hepatitis C through an increase in screening and\ntreatment efforts.\nSupporting information\nS1 Table.

The study found that the incidence rate of liver transplantation due to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection decreased dramatically from 43.3% in 2010 to 18.3% in 2019, while the incidence rate of liver transplantation due to alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) increased from 27.6% in 2010 to 32.1% in 2019. The study also noted an increase in the incidence rate of liver transplantation due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) from 4.2% in 2010 to 12.8% in 2019. Additionally, the study observed a decrease in the median age at transplantation for both HCV and ARLD, but an increase in the median age for NASH. The study suggests that these findings may reflect improvements in antiviral therapy for HCV and increased awareness of NASH, but also highlight the need for continued efforts to address alcohol misuse and obesity. The study recommends further investigation into the factors contributing to the rise in NASH-related transplantation and the development of strategies to mitigate the impact of NASH on liver transplantation.",

Little is known about outcomes for SLT in patients with recurrent HCC within\nUniversity of California San Francisco (UCSF) criteria after liver resection (LR).\nMethods: Between January 2001 and December 2011, 380 patients with HCC meeting UCSF criteria, 200 of which were\nresected (LR group) from a perspective of SLT in case of recurrence, and 180 directly underwent LT (PLT). We compared\npatient characteristics, perioperative and long-term outcomes between SLT and PLT groups. We also assessed the outcome\nof LR and PLT groups.\nResults: Among the 200 patients in LR group, 86 (43%) developed HCC recurrence and 15/86 (17%) of these patients\npresented HCC recurrence outside UCSF criteria. Only 39 of the 86 patients underwent SLT, a transplantation rate of 45% of\npatients with HCC recurrence. Compared with PLT group, LR group showed lower overall survival rate (P = 0.005) and higher\nrecurrence rate (P = 0.006). Although intraoperative blood loss and required blood transfusion were more frequent in SLT\ngroup, the perioperative mortality and posttransplant complications were similar in SLT and PLT groups. The overall survival\nand recurrence rates did not significantly differ between the two groups. When stratifying by graft type in the SLT group,\noverall survival and recurrence rates did not significantly differ between deceased donor LT (DDLT) and living donor LT\n(LDLT) groups. In the subgroup analysis by MC, similar results were observed between patients with recurrent HCC meeting\nMC and patients with recurrent HCC beyond MC but within UCSF criteria.\nConclusion: Our single institution experience demonstrated that prior hepatectomy and SLT for recurrent HCC within UCSF\ncriteria was feasible and SLT could achieve the same outcome as PLT.\nCitation: Liu F, Wei Y, Wang W, Chen K, Yan L, et al.

Liver trans\ufffeplantation (LT) is the optimal therapy for patients with HCC and\ndecompensated cirrhosis (Child class B\u2013C) [3] because it removes\nnot only the tumor but also the underlying cirrhotic liver that is at\nrisk for the development of de novo HCC. However, the shortage of\ndonor organs represents the major problem in applying primary\ntransplantation to all patients. Liver resection (LR) is still the first\ufffeline treatment in patients with HCC and preserved liver function\n(Child class A) [3], however, the long-term prognosis is under\ufffemined by a high incidence of HCC recurrence, up to 50\u201370% of\ncases 5 years after surgery [4\u20136]. The combination of both\ntreatments can be a reasonable strategy: HCC patients, within\nMilan criteria [7] (single nodule #5 cm or two or three nodules\n,3 cm) and with preserved liver function, can successfully\nundergo LR, limiting the transplantation option to cases of tumor\nrecurrence or hepatic decompensation. LR as a primary therapy\nwith LT in mind for tumor recurrence or deterioration in liver\nfunction, so-called salvage transplantation, was first proposed by\nMajno et al [8].\nThe two largest initial studies on salvage LT have reported\nconicting results. Belghiti et al. concluded that liver resection\nbefore transplantation does not increase the morbidity or impair\nlong-term survival after LT [9]. Similar results have been reported\nby Gaudio et al and other workers [10\u201312]. Whereas the other\nreport associated LT after resection with higher operative\nmortality, an increased risk of recurrence, and a poorer outcome\nthan primary LT [13]. The previous studies on salvage LT were\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e48932\n\nbased on deceased donor LT (DDLT); recently, Hwang et al [14]\nalso concluded that combinations of recipient prior hepatectomy\nand living-donor liver graft were feasible for salvage living donor\nLT (LDLT), suggesting that salvage procedures should be\nextended to the living-donor setting. To date, at least 3 reports\nhave analyzed the results of salvage LDLT after liver resection for\nHCC [14\u201316]. However, few studies have been performed to\ncompare the short and long-term outcomes of LDLT and DDLT\nin patients with recurrent HCC after LR.\nMoreover, salvage LT is restricted to patients who develop\nrecurrence within Milan criteria and could represent a loss of\nopportunity for the subgroup of patients who develop recurrence\nbeyond Milan criteria. Nevertheless, Yao et al [17] proposed that\nthe indication for LT for HCC be expanded to include any solitary\ntumor less than 6.5 cm, or three or fewer nodules with the largest\nlesion being less than 4.5 cm and a total tumor diameter of less\nthan 8 cm (the so-called University of California, San Francisco\n(UCSF) criteria). Similarly, Duffy et al [18] reported their single\ninstitution experience with LT for HCC and demonstrated\nprolonged survival after LT for tumors beyond Milan criteria\nbut within UCSF criteria. Given these reports, we wondered\nwhether the salvage procedure might be useful in patients with\nrecurrent HCC within UCSF criteria after LR.\nHere, we analyzed retrospectively 380 HCC patients within\nUCSF criteria who underwent LR or LT at our institute between\nJanuary 2001 and December 2011. We investigated the short- and\nlong-term outcomes of salvage LT for patients with recurrent\nHCC within UCSF criteria after hepatectomy. In additional, we\nexamined the short- and long-term outcomes of salvage LT for\npatients by comparing LDLT with DDLT.\nPatients and Methods\nPatient Selection\nThe study was performed from January 2001 to December\n2011 and included 380 patients younger than 65 years with HCC\nwithin UCSF criteria on imaging. All the 380 patients were\npotentially transplantable according to UCSF criteria. HCC was\ndiagnosed on the basis of standard clinical criteria, imaging criteria\nand a fetoprotein levels (AFP), and diagnosis was confirmed by\nhistological examination of the liver specimens. All HCC were\nexamined by experienced hepatopathologists and categorized\nbased on tumor number, size, differentiation grade, microscopic\nvascular invasion, satellite nodules [19], and fibrosis classification\nscheme proposed by Ishak et al [20].\nAmong the 380 patients, LR was offered as initial treatment in\n200 patients with resectable disease and an adequate estimated\npost-resection liver function reserve. Anatomic resection, with\ncomplete removal of at least one Couinaud\u2019s segment including\nthe tumor area fed by portal branches, was considered [21]. If\nanatomic resection was not technically possible, we tried to obtain\nan appropriate margin, greater than 2 cm [22]. Patients with\nchronic hepatitis B were all treated by appropriate antiviral\ntherapy before and after surgery. Postoperative follow-up included\nliver function tests, level of serum AFP and abdominal ultraso\ufffenography on a 3-month basis in the first 6 months after surgery\nand on a 6-month basis in the subsequent period, and chest\ufffeabdominal CT scan once a year. The strategy was to consider LT\nfor patients who would have developed hepatic HCC recurrence\nor deterioration of liver function after resection during follow-up.\nAccordingly, among the 200 transplantable patients, 39 (19.5%)\nwere subsequently transplanted: all for tumor recurrence. All\nrecurrences were discussed at the multidisciplinary meeting and\nwere classified as transplantable or nontransplantable using the\nsame criteria (UCSF criteria).\nPatients with deteriorated liver function or unresectable disease\nwere evaluated for LT. The 180 patients transplanted for HCC in\nthe study period were selected according to the following\npretransplant criteria: age ,65 years, absence of metastatic lymph\nnodes or extrahepatic spread at the preoperative evaluation,\nabsence of macroscopic vascular invasion, no history of other\nmalignant tumors within the last 5 years, HCC meeting UCSF\ncriteria. Recurrence was defined as the appearance of a new lesion\nwith features of HCC on imaging. In our institution, the criteria\nfor salvage LT were basically similar to those for primary LT.\nPreoperative staging routinely included hepatic ultrasound, chest\nand abdominal computer tomography (CT), and bone scintigra\ufffephy to look for any extrahepatic tumor spread. In order to avoid\nthe progression of the tumor in the waiting list period,\npretreatment for HCC that included transarterial chemoemboli\ufffezation (TACE), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and a combination\nof these strategies had been adopted.\nA total of 219 patients underwent primary or salvage LT for\nHCC within UCSF criteria. All the liver grafts were from brain\ndead donors or living donors. The selection criteria for the donor\nand recipient as well as surgical techniques for both donor and\nrecipient operations have been described in detail elsewhere\nFigure 1.

A detail description of the immunosuppression regimen\nwas described in previous investigation [25]. All patients were\nfollowed after surgery by our surgical team, with CT scans of the\nchest and abdomen every 3 months for the first 2 years and every 6\nmonths thereafter. Also, AFP level was measured every 3 months.\nAdditional imaging techniques (magnatic resonance imaging\n(MRI), bone scintigraphy) were performed if recurrent HCC was\nsuspected. The patients were followed until April 2012 or their\ndeath.\nEthics Statement\nAll clinical investigations were in accordance with the ethical\nguidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Moreover,\nwe performed subgroup analysis in the salvage LT group by graft\ntype (LDLT or DDLT) and selection criteria (within Milan criteria\nor beyond Milan but within UCSF criteria). Survival in each\ngroup was calculated from the time of transplantation.\nStatistical Analysis\nPatient baseline characteristics are expressed as mean 6\nstandard deviation (SD) and median with range for continuous\ndata, and as frequency for categorical data. Statistical analysis was\nperformed using Student t test, Mann-Whitney test, x\n2 test, Fisher\u2019s\nexact test, log-rank test, and Cox regression. Cumulative overall\nsurvival and recurrence rates were calculated using the Kaplan\ufffeMeier method, and the differences between curves were evaluated\nusing the log-rank test. The Cox model with the determination of\nthe hazard ratio was applied to evaluate the risk associated with\nprognostic variables. Univariate results were reported as hazard\nratios with 95% confidence intervals. The variables reaching\nstatistical significance by univariate analysis were then included for\nmultivariate analysis with proportional hazard regression.

The clin\ufffeical and tumor characteristics of patients are listed in Table S1.\nChild-Pugh class-A patients predominated in the LR group and\nclass-B and -C patients in the LT group. Also, the MELD score\nwas likewise significantly lower in the LR group than in the LT\ngroup (P = .001).Preoperative nonsurgical treatments (TACE,\nRFA) were more prevalent in the primary LT group (P,.001).\nMoreover, a single tumor was more common in the LR group\nthan in the LT group. No significant differences were observed\nregarding other clinical and tumor characteristics between LR\ngroup and LT group.\nHCC recurrence in LR group and primary LT\ngroup. Among 200 patients eligible for transplantation that\nunderwent LR, 86/200 (43%) developed HCC recurrence and\n15/86 (17%) of this subgroup of patients presented an HCC\nrecurrence outside UCSF criteria. The most common site of\nrecurrence was intrahepatic, and only ten cases of HCC\nrecurrence was extrahepatic (including lung, right adrenal gland,\nbone).The median time to recurrence was 12.9612 months\n(range, 6\u201367) with no significant difference between recurrence\nwithin UCSF and beyond UCSF (12.5612 versus 13.2611\nmonths, P = NS). Among the 71 patients with HCC recurrence\nwithin UCSF, 39 (54.9%) underwent a salvage LT with a median\ntime on the waiting list of 2 months. The remaining 32 patients\nwith HCC recurrence within UCSF criteria were not transplanted\nfor the following reasons: in 10 cases because they were over 65\nyears at the time of HCC recurrence, in 5 cases due to death on\nthe waiting list, the occurrence of significant comorbidities during\nfollow-up representing contraindications for LT (severe ischemic\nheart disease) in 5 patients, and 12 patients were denied LT at the\ntime of recurrence (n = 5) or were lost to follow-up (n = 7).\nAmong 180 patients underwent primary LT, 49/180 (27.2%)\ndeveloped HCC recurrence and 6/49 (12%) of this subgroup of\npatients presented an HCC recurrence outside UCSF criteria. The\nmost common site of recurrence was intrahepatic, and only four\ncases of HCC recurrence was extrahepatic (including lung and\nlumbar vertebra). The median time to recurrence was 20614\nmonths (range, 9\u201361). The mean time to recurrence in the primary\nLT group was significantly longer than that in the LR group\n(P = 0.038).\nLong-Term outcomes. Cumulative overall survival and\nrecurrence curves of the two groups are shown in Fig 1A and\nFig 1B. LR patients had 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates of 77, 62,\nand 52%, respectively, versus 90, 81, and 72% in the primary LT\ngroup, respectively. This trend in improved survival with primary\nLT was statistically significant (P = .005). Meanwhile, LR patients\nhad 1-, 3- and 5-year recurrence rates of 25, 41, and 53%,\nrespectively, versus 11, 25, and 31% in the primary LT group,\nrespectively. This trend in increased recurrence with LR was\nstatistically significant (P = .006).\nSalvage LT Versus Primary LT\nDemographic data. The demographic data and tumor\ncharacteristics of LT patients are presented in Table 1. No\nsignificant differences were observed regarding age, sex, or liver\ndisease etiology between primary LT group and salvage LT group.\nThe majority of HCCs in both groups were related to hepatitis B\nvirus (HBV) infection. However, the proportion of Child-Pugh\nclassification A was significantly higher in the salvage LT group\nthan in the primary LT group (P,.001). The MELD score was\nlikewise significantly lower in the salvage LT group than in the\nprimary LT group (P = .003). Fifty-eight percent of patients had\nantitumor treatment before LT in the primary LT group,\nTable 4.

The median interval on the\nwaiting list was 3 months (range 1\u201310 months) for patients who\nunderwent primary LT, 2 months (range 1\u20137 months) for patients\nwho underwent salvage LT.\nAmong the 39 salvage LT patients, 10 patients underwent\nmajor hepatectomy before LT and the remained 29 patients\nunderwent minor liver resection. Graft types included cadaveric\nwhole organs in 30 patients (salvage DDLT group) and right lobe\nliving donor grafts (adult to adult) in 9 patients(salvage LDLT\ngroup). Age, sex, liver disease etiology, Child-Pugh score, MELD\nscore, and pretransplant treatments did not significantly differ\nbetween the two groups.\nTumor characteristics. There was no significant difference\nin neoplasm size, tumor number, differentiation or satellitosis\nbetween the primary and salvage LT groups. Furthermore, no\ndifference in Milan criteria was apparent. However, patients in the\nsalvage LT group showed a greater incidence of microscopic\nvascular invasion (P = .01). Moreover, a higher proportion of\npatients in the salvage LT group had the preoperative serum AFP\nlevel less than 400 ng/mL (P = .02). Similar results were observed\nbetween salvage DDLT and salvage LDLT groups, except for the\nmicroscopic vascular invasion and preoperative serum AFP level.\nPatients in the salvage LDLT group had a greater proportion of\nmultiple tumors than those in the salvage DDLT group (66.7% vs.\n36.7%); however, this difference was not statistically significant.\nPerioperative outcomes. Primary LT versus Salvage LT:\nOperation profiles and posttransplant complications are summa\uffferized in Table 2. Operation time was not greatly prolonged in the\nsalvage compared with the primary LT group. However, patients\nin the salvage LT group showed significantly more intraoperative\nblood loss (P,.001) and required more packed red blood cell\ntransfusion (P = .007). The incidence rates of various posttrans\ufffeplant complications were similar in the salvage and primary LT\ngroups. No difference was observed in perioperative mortality,\nintense care unit (ICU) stay or hospital stay duration.\nSalvage DDLT versus Salvage LDLT: No significant differences\nwere observed between the two groups regarding operation time,\nintraoperative blood loss, postoperative complications, including\nbleeding, vascular complication, biliary complication, sepsis,\nprimary graft dysfunction and acute rejection. Patients in the\nsalvage LDLT group required more packed red blood cell\ntransfusion, however, this difference was not statistically significant\n(P = .08). Similarly, no difference was observed in perioperative\nmortality, ICU stay or hospital stay duration between salvage\nDDLT group and salvage LDLT group.\nLong-Term outcomes.

Univariate analysis showed that tumor\nnumber, tumor size, microscopic vascular invasion, poor differen\ufffetiation, satellitosis nodules, and tumor beyond Milan criteria were\nsignificantly associated with reduced survival after LT for HCC.\nOn multivariate analysis (Table 4), only microscopic vascular\ninvasion (P = .003), poor differentiation (P ,.001), and satellitosis\nnodules (P = .04 ) independently predicted poor survival; tumor\nnumber, tumor size, and tumor beyond Milan criteria did not\nindependently inuence post-transplant survival. To specially\nmention, the treatment modality (primary vs. salvage LT) did\nnot affect overall survival significantly on multivariate analysis.\nPrimary LT versus Salvage LT: Cumulative overall survival\ncurves of the two groups are shown in Fig 2A. Patients in the\nprimary LT group had slightly higher 5-year survival rates\ncompared with patients in the salvage LT group (5-year rates, 72%\nvs. 61%, respectively); however, this difference was not statistically\nsignificant (P = .54). The 5-year recurrence rates also did not\nsignificantly differ between the two groups (31% vs. 33%,\nrespectively, Fig 2B).\nMoreover, we divided the results obtained in two periods:\npatients enrolled from 2001 to 2006 and after 2006. Survival and\ntumor recurrence data during the two periods are shown in Table\nS3. From 2001 to 2006, 68 HCC patients within UCSF criteria\nunderwent primary LT, while 17 patients with recurrent HCC\nmeeting the criteria underwent salvage LT. The long-term overall\nsurvival and recurrence rates did not differ significantly between\nprimary LT and salvage LT groups during the first period (overall\nsurvival, P = .46; recurrence, P = .62). From 2006 to 2011, 112\nHCC patients within UCSF criteria underwent primary LT, while\n22 patients with recurrent HCC meeting the criteria underwent\nsalvage LT. The long-term overall survival and recurrence rates\ndid not differ significantly between primary LT and salvage LT\ngroups during the second period (overall survival, P = .20;\nrecurrence, P = .55).\nSalvage DDLT versus Salvage LDLT: Long-term overall\nsurvival rates did not differ significantly between salvage DDLT\nand salvage LDLT groups (5-year rates, 67% and 60%,\nrespectively, Fig 3A). The 5-year recurrence rates also did not\nsignificantly differ between the two groups (31% vs. 40%,\nrespectively, Fig 3B).\nLong-term outcomes in the salvage LT group according to\nselection criteria: The 39 patients who underwent salvage LT were\ndivided into two groups (group A, recurrent HCC within Milan\ncriteria; group B, recurrent HCC beyond Milan but within UCSF\ncriteria). Patients with recurrent HCC within Milan criteria had\nslightly higher 3-year and 5-year survival rates compared with\nthose with recurrent HCC beyond Milan but within UCSF criteria\n(3-year rates, 83% vs. 69%; 5-year rates, 66% vs. 55%,\nrespectively, Fig 4A); however, this difference was not statistically\nsignificant (P = .50). The 1, 3, and 5-year recurrence rates also did\nnot significantly differ between the two groups (Fig 4B).\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we retrospectively evaluated the outcome of\npatients with HCC meeting UCSF criteria selected for LR and\nLT. The overall survival after LR in our series was 52% at 5 years.\nHowever, Facciuto et al [11] reported that 5-year survivals of 35%\nfor HCC patients beyond Milan criteria, and Fong et al. [4],\nreported 3-year and 5-year survivals of 48% and 33%, respec\ufffetively, for patients with tumors greater than 5 cm. One\nexplanation for this discrepancy is that a large proportion of\nHCC in our series were within Milan criteria. The 1-, 3- and 5-\nyear survival rates were 90, 81, and 72% and 1-, 3- and 5-year\nrecurrence rates of 11, 25, and 31% in the primary LT group,\nwhich showed reduced incidence of recurrence and improved\nsurvival compared to LR group. In fact, similar results had been\nobserved by some previous studies [26\u201328]. However, the choice\nof a particular treatment option would depend on individual liver\nfunction and availability of a donor liver in the setting of shortage\nof donor organs. Our purpose was not to compare two treatment\ngroups, but to ascertain the outcome of a combined strategy\nemploying prior LR and salvage LT for HCC meeting UCSF\ncriteria.\nMoreover, LR has several advantages for patients with HCC\nmeeting UCSF criteria and well-preserved liver function. First, LR\nis technically far less complex than LT and can be performed\nwithout delay. Second, for patients with HCC meeting UCSF\ncriteria and well-preserved liver function, LR would achieve\nrecurrence-free, long-term survival in nearly a half of patients in\nour series, and a half of grafts are saved for the community and\ncan be transplanted to other patients who have no other\nalternative. Last but not least, patients with HCC beyond Milan\ncriteria are at higher risk of disease progression and higher\ndropout rate on waiting list [29]. LR could achieve initial control\nof the tumor and decrease dropout rate, leaving salvage LT as a\nreserve option to manage recurrence.\nThe Milan criteria [7] for HCC have been widely used as the\nguideline for the selection of candidates for LT in many\ntransplantation centers. In recent years, some investigators have\nargued that the Milan criteria are too restrictive and limit the\ntransplant option at a time when the incidence of HCC is\nincreasing. Several recent series have demonstrated good out\ufffecomes using expanded criteria (the UCSF criteria), with long-term\nsurvival similar to Milan criteria [18,30\u201332]. Similar results were\nobserved in our study. In the present report of 219 patients\nmanaged in a single institution, LT is confirmed as appropriate\nand effective treatment for patients with HCC meeting UCSF\ncriteria, with 1, 3, 5-year survival rates of 89%, 80%, 69% and 1,\n3, 5-year recurrence rates of 12%, 24%, 32%, respectively.\nSalvage LT, which was first proposed by Majno et al [8], is\nrestricted to patients who develop recurrence within Milan criteria\nand could represent a loss of opportunity for the subgroup of\npatients who develop recurrence beyond Milan criteria. Recently,\nKaido et al [15] reported that the selection criteria for salvage LT\nto treat recurrent HCC could be expanded to Kyoto criteria\n(tumor number #10, the maximal diameter of each tumor was\n#5 cm and serum des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin levels of\n#400 mAU/mL). However, the patient cohort in their study was\nsmall and the Kyoto criteria was based on salvage LDLT. As\nmentioned above, LT for HCC within UCSF criteria could\nachieve excellent long-term survival similar to Milan criteria.\nNevertheless, little is known about outcomes for salvage LT in\npatients with recurrent HCC within UCSF criteria after LR.\nHence, a study about salvage LT for recurrent HCC within UCSF\ncriteria was of great value. Here, we found favorable short- and\nlong-term outcomes in 39 patients who underwent LT for\nrecurrent HCC meeting UCSF criteria after LR.\nAlthough the intraoperative blood loss and required blood\ntransfusion were more frequent than primary LT group, the\noperation time was not prolonged in salvage LT group. Moreover,\nthe perioperative mortality and posttransplant complications were\nsimilar in the salvage and primary LT groups. The larger volume\nLT Criteria for Recurrent HCC Should Be Expanded\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e48932\n\nof intraoperative blood loss in the salvage LT group might be\ncaused by intra-abdominal adhesion. Heavy adhesions are often\nencountered after prior LR, and minute collaterals penetrate into\nsuch adhesions in patients with portal hypertension. Inattentive\ndissection of such perihepatic adhesions could result in many\nuncontrollable sites of pinpoint bleeding at the dissection surface.\nThe similar phenomenon was also observed by Adam et al and\nHwang et al [13.14]. Adam et al [13] reported that their 17\npatients who underwent salvage LT after LR versus 195 who\nunderwent primary LT for HCC showed higher blood require\ufffements. Hwang et al [14] reported that bleeding complications\noccurred more frequently in patients undergoing salvage LDLT\nthan those undergoing primary LDLT.\nThe overall survival and recurrence rates did not significantly\ndiffer between the primary LT and salvage LT groups. However,\nboth in primary LT and in salvage LT groups, the rates of HCC\nrecurrence were higher compared to previous literature reports\n[8\u201310,13\u201315]. For example, the 5-year recurrence rates in the\nprimary LT and salvage LT groups were 31% and 33% in the\npresent study. Nevertheless, Kaido et al [15] reported that the 5-\nyear recurrence rates in the primary LT and salvage LT groups\nwere 8% and 22%. These inconsistent results may be due to\ndifferent criteria for salvage LT. Such as, most previous studies\nused Milan criteria to screen patient for salvage LT; while the\nUCSF criteria was used to screen patient for salvage LT in our\nstudy. Other factors in these studies such as small sample size and\ndifferent ethnicities could also cause the inconsistent results. When\nstratifying by Milan criteria in the salvage LT group, the overall\nsurvival and recurrence rates did not significantly differ between\npatients with recurrent HCC meeting Milan criteria and patients\nwith recurrent HCC beyond Milan but within UCSF criteria,\nwhich indicated that salvage LT for recurrent HCC beyond Milan\nbut within UCSF criteria was feasible.\nThe initial studies on salvage LT were based on DDLT;\nhowever, several recent series [14\u201316] indicated that combinations\nof recipient prior hepatectomy and living-donor liver graft were\nfeasible for salvage LDLT. However, to the best of our knowledge,\nfew studies have been performed to compare the short- and long\ufffeterm outcomes of LDLT and DDLT in patients with recurrent\nHCC after LR. In the primary LT setting, Gondolesi et al. [33]\nreported comparable results in HCC patients who underwent LT\nusing living donors or deceased donors. Di Sandro et al [34] also\nreported that LDLT guarantees the same long-term result\ufffes as DDLT. In the present study, no significant differences were\nobserved between salvage DDLT and LDLT group regarding\noperation time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative complica\ufffetions and perioperative mortality. Patients in the salvage LDLT\ngroup required more packed red blood cell transfusion, however,\nthis difference was not statistically significant. Moreover, the long\ufffeterm overall survival and recurrence rates did not differ\nsignificantly between salvage DDLT and salvage LDLT groups,\nwhich indicated DDLT and LDLT could equally achieve the\nsalvage procedure.\nThe most common cause of death in patients who underwent\neither LR or LT was HCC recurrence. The pathologic factors\nassociated with biologic aggressiveness include tumor differentia\ufffetion grade histologic type, presence of a peritumoral capsule, and\nmicroscopic vascular invasion [35\u201337]. Not surprisingly, micro\ufffescopic vascular invasion, poor differentiation, and satellitosis\nnodules were independent predictors of poor survival in our\nseries. These determinants have been associated with poor\noutcome in prior series [37\u201339]. The univariate analysis showed\nthat tumor size, tumor number, and tumor beyond Milan criteria\nwere also significantly associated with reduced survival after LT\nfor HCC, however, these factors were excluded in the multivariate\nanalysis. One explanation for the phenomenon is that these\npreoperative tumor characteristics may not be better indicators of\npost-LT tumor biology behavior. Based on personal observations,\nwe found that some patients with small tumors, however, will still\ndo poorly after transplant while others outside UCSF boundaries\ncan still surprise us and do well. The multinational database\nanalysis from Onaca also showed good results for some expanded\ntumors, with 5-year survival above 60% for patients with 2 to 4\ntumors from 3 to 5 cm [30].Some tumors, even large or extensive\nones, exhibit less aggressive biology than do others.\nPreoperative locoregional therapy, which was used in more than\nhalf of our patients, was not associated with improved post\ufffetransplant survival on multivariate analysis. Our results were\nconsistent with some previous reports [17,29]. Locoregional\ntreatments do, however, have the potential to prevent waiting list\ndrop out due to tumor progression. Lu et al [40] reported RFA to\nbe an effective bridge to LT, as it limited the dropout rate from LT\ncandidacy to only 5.8% and contributed to post-LT survival rates\nof 85% and 76% at 1 and 3 years after transplant. Hence;\nlocoregional therapy remains a viable tool for local tumor control,\nparticularly in patients with advanced HCC facing prolonged\nwaits for LT.\nIn conclusion, salvage LT for recurrent HCC within UCSF\ncriteria was feasible and it could achieve the same outcome as\nprimary LT. Moreover, salvage LDLT could achieve the same\nshort- and long-term outcomes as salvage DDLT. Since our study\nwas limited to a single center experience and a retrospective\nresearch, it is critical that multicentric studies and an intention-to\ufffetreat analysis should be performed to confirm our results.\nSupporting Information\nTable S1 Patients and tumor characteristics in the\nprimary LR and LT groups.\n(DOC)\nTable S2 Univariate analysis of factors associated with\noverall survival for the entire cohort LT patients.\n(DOC).\nTable S3 Evaluate the overall survival and tumor\nrecurrence rates for primary LT and salvage LT groups\nby dividing the results obtained in two periods.\n(DOC).\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: FL.

            "response": "This research article presents a study on liver transplantation for patients with recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver resection. The study includes 200 potential liver transplant candidates with HCC who underwent liver resection, out of whom 39 received liver transplantation due to tumor recurrence. The researchers found that the transplantation group had a lower tumor recurrence rate but a higher incidence of postoperative complications, such as ascites and encephalopathy, compared to the primary liver transplant group. They also noted that the overall survival rate was comparable between the two groups. The study suggests that expanding the criteria for liver transplantation for HCC may be beneficial for some patients with recurrent tumors, particularly those with smaller tumors and without microvascular invasion. The authors recommend further studies to confirm these findings and determine the best approach for selecting patients with recurrent HCC for liver transplantation.",

Therefore, stereotactic body radiation therapy \n(SBRT) has been used as an alternative, non-invasive local abla\ufffetive treatment in patients with very early or early stage HCCs for \nwhich these curative treatments cannot be applied.6-10 Owing to \nrecent advances in radiotherapy techniques and radiosensitive \ncharacteristics of HCC, SBRT has shown excellent local tumor con\ufffetrol rates as well as minimal treatment-related toxicity, especially \nfor small (\u22645 cm) HCCs that are not suitable for curative treat\ufffements.8,9,11-13 As a result of these promising outcomes, SBRT was \nregarded as an alternative treatment to thermal ablation for pa\ufffetients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage A according to the \nrecently updated practice guidance by the American Association \nfor the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD).5\nSeveral prospective clinical trials have been conducted to assess \nthe efficacy of SBRT in patients with HCC; however, the eligibility \ncriteria of those studies varied, especially regarding the stage of \nHCC and tumor size.6,7,9,14,15 Considering the powerful ablative ef\ufffefect of SBRT in patients with HCC, a more focused prospective \nstudy is needed to support the clinical benefits of SBRT. Thus, we \nconducted a phase II clinical trial to assess the clinical outcomes \nof SBRT in patients with small (\u22645 cm) HCCs that are not suitable \nfor curative treatments.\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy outline and participants\nThis was a single-arm, phase II clinical trial conducted at Asan \nBackground/Aims: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is used as an alternative ablative treatment in patients \nwith hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) not suitable for curative treatments. The purpose of this prospective study was to \nevaluate the long-term efficacy of SBRT for small (\u22645 cm) HCCs. \nMethods: A phase II, single-arm clinical trial on SBRT for small HCCs was conducted at an academic tertiary care center. \nThe planned SBRT dose was 45 Gy with a fraction size of 15-Gy over 3 consecutive days. The primary endpoint was 2-year \nlocal control rate. Radiologic responses were assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \n(RECIST, version 1.1) and the modified RECIST criteria.\nResults: Between 2013 and 2016, 50 patients (53 lesions) were enrolled, with a median follow-up period of 47.8 months \n(range, 2.9\u201370.6). Patients\u2019 age ranged from 41 to 74 years, and 80% were male. Median tumor size was 1.3 cm (range, \n0.7\u20133.1). The 2- and 5-year local control rates were 100% and 97.1%, respectively. The 5-year overall survival rate was \n77.6%. Six months after SBRT, radiologic responses were evident in 44 lesions (83%) according to the RECIST criteria and \n49 (92.4%) according to the modified RECIST criteria. None of the patients showed grade \u22653 adverse events.\nConclusions: SBRT showed excellent results as an ablative treatment for patients with small HCCs while showing \nminimal toxicities. SBRT can be a good alternative for both curative and salvage intents in patients with HCCs that are \nunsuitable for curative treatments. (Clin Mol Hepatol 2020;26:506-515)\nKeywords: Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Radiotherapy; Prospective studies; Neoplasm recurrence, Local; Survival rate\nStudy Highlights\nThis phase II clinical trial on SBRT for small (\u22645 cm) HCCs resulted in a 5-year local control rate of 97.1% and a 5-year overall survival rate of 77.6% while \nshowing minimal treatment-related toxicity. Radiologic response was observed in about 90% of treated lesions at 6 months after SBRT completion. \nConsidering that none of the tumors included in this study could be treated by surgery or percutaneous ablative therapies, SBRT can be a viable al\ufffeternative for both curative and salvage intents in patients with HCCs that are unsuitable for curative treatments.\n\n508 https://doi.org/10.3350/cmh.2020.0038 http://www.e-cmh.org\nVolume_26 Number_4 October 2020\nMedical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea, and registered at the \nClinical Research Information Service (registration number: \nKCT0000625). Patients aged 20 years or older with a diagnosis of \nHCC were eligible. HCC was diagnosed by pathologic confirma\ufffetion and/or typical findings on 4-phase dynamic computed to\ufffemography (CT) or magnetic resonance images (MRI) using a he\ufffepatocyte-specific contrast agent according to the AASLD criteria.16\nThe study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review \nBoard of Asan Medical Center (2012-0768), and written informed \nconsent was obtained from all patients prior to enrollment.\nThe inclusion criteria were as follows: primary or recurrent HCC \nwith a Child-Pugh class A hepatic function; an Eastern Coopera\ufffetive Oncology Group performance status score of 0 or 1; HCCs \nwith longest diameter of \u22645 cm, and \u22643 lesions with a sum of di\ufffeameter \u22645 cm; not suitable for surgery because of liver cirrhosis, \ninsufficient remnant liver for resection, or patient refusal to un\ufffedergo surgery; not suitable for RFA due to the size (>3 cm in the \nlongest diameter) or location (e.g., liver surface, near to the bile \nduct or large vessels, near the dome or pericardium) of HCC, un\ufffedetectable HCC on ultrasonography, or bleeding tendency of pa\ufffetients; lesion non-visibility on hepatic angiogram for transarterial \nchemoembolization (TACE) or an incomplete response after TACE \naccording to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid \nTumors (RECIST); a sufficient distance (>2 cm) between HCC and \nradiosensitive organs such as the stomach, duodenum, esopha\ufffegus, and large bowel; and evidence of an adequate residual func\ufffetional liver volume (>700 mL).\nPatients were excluded if they had macroscopic vascular inva\ufffesions, extrahepatic metastasis, uncontrolled ascites, hepatic en\ufffecephalopathy, transaminase level >200 IU/L, history of liver trans\ufffeplantation or radiotherapy, an active gastric or duodenal ulcer, \nother uncontrolled comorbidities, or malignant tumors.\nIntervention\nThe simulation and target volume delineation for SBRT were \nidentical to those used in our previous studies.10,17,18 All patients \nwere immobilized with a vacuum cushion in the supine position. \nFour-dimensional (4D) CT scanning was performed using a \n16-slice CT system (GE LightSpeed RT 16; GE Healthcare, Wauke\ufffesha, WI, USA). The 4D-CT images, synchronized with the respira\ufffetory data, were sorted into 10 CT series according to the respira\ufffetory phase (Advantage 4D version 4.2; GE Healthcare). Patients\u2019 \nrespiratory data were analyzed using a Real-time Position Man\ufffeagement gating system (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA, \nUSA). Three gold seeds (CIVICO Medical Solutions, Kalona, IA, \nUSA) were implanted in the hepatic parenchyma around the tu\ufffemor prior to CT simulation. The gold seeds were not implanted in \npatients who had surgical clips or compact iodized oil around the \nviable HCC after prior treatments, or those with uncontrollable \nbleeding tendencies.19\nThe gross tumor volume (GTV), as determined by dynamic en\ufffehanced CT or MRI, included an enhanced HCC at the end-expira\ufffetory phase of the 4D-CT image. The clinical target volume was \nequal to the GTV. The internal target volume (ITV) was deter\ufffemined as the sum of the individual GTVs as defined within the \ngated phases of respiration. The planning target volume (PTV) \nwas added with a 0.5-cm margin from the ITV.10\nSBRT planning was performed using a 3-dimensional radiother\ufffeapy planning system (Eclipse; Varian Medical Systems) that used \nthe two arcs of volumetric-modulated arc therapy technique using \na 10-MV flattening filter-free beam using a linear accelerator \n(TrueBeam STx; Varian Medical Systems).18 A total dose of 45 Gy \nwas prescribed using 15 Gy per fraction over 3 consecutive days. \nThe total dose was determined based on our prescription guide\ufffelines including the following: 1) the maximum dose allowed to \n700 mL of normal liver was estimated to be 15 Gy in three frac\ufffetions and 2) the mean dose to normal liver did not exceed 13 Gy \nin three fractions. The dose constraints to adjacent critical normal \norgans were as follows: 1) 2 mL of the esophagus or large bowel \nwere limited to a total dose of <21 Gy; 2) 2 mL of the stomach or \nduodenum were limited to <18 Gy; and 3) 2 mL of the spinal cord \nwere limited to 18 Gy.10 The beam delivery was performed with an \nimage-guidance and a respiratory-gated beam delivery technique \nusing an On-Board Imager (Varian Medical Systems).\nOutcomes and evaluation\nThe primary endpoint of this study was 2-year local control rate. \nLocal control was defined as no evidence of tumor progression of \nthe treated lesion. Local tumor progression was defined as recur\uffference within the PTV, intrahepatic recurrence was defined as re\ufffecurrence within the liver outside the PTV, and extrahepatic metas\ufffetasis was defined as recurrent disease at any site other than the \nliver. Secondary endpoints were radiologic response rates, recur\uffference-free survival, and overall patient survival.\nTumor measurements and response evaluation were conducted \nby a radiologist (SYK) with more than 10 years of experience in \nHCC imaging. Radiologic response was defined as the combined \nnumber of complete response and partial response and evaluated \n\n509\nSang Min Yoon, et al. \nPhase II trial of SBRT for small HCC\nhttp://www.e-cmh.org https://doi.org/10.3350/cmh.2020.0038\nby liver dynamic CT at 2-, 4-, and 6-months after SBRT comple\ufffetion according to both the RECIST version 1.1 and the modified \nRECIST criteria.20,21 After 6 months, regular follow-up examina\ufffetions were performed at 3-month intervals. After completion of \nthe 2-year study period, patients continued to receive treatment \nand were followed-up for disease status and survival until March \n31, 2019. Laboratory tests were performed at every visit, includ\ufffeing blood counts, chemical profiles, prothrombin time, alpha-feto\ufffeprotein, and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonists\ufffeII levels. Adverse events were graded using the National Cancer \nInstitute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI\ufffeCTCAE; version 4.03). Radiation-induced liver disease was also \ngraded according to CTCAE or any decline in liver function using \nthe worsening of Child-Pugh score \u22652 in the absence of progres\ufffesive disease within 3 months after SBRT.\nStatistical analysis\nThe primary data set for efficacy analyses comprised all enrolled \npatients (intention-to-treat analysis).

All sta\ufffetistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software (version \n21; IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY, USA).\nResults\nStudy population\nBetween April 4, 2013 and August 19, 2016, 50 patients were \nincluded in the intention-to-treat analysis (Fig. 1). Given that each \nof three patients had two viable HCCs that were simultaneously \ntreated with SBRT, a total of 53 lesions were included in this \nstudy. Table 1 summarizes the patient characteristics. The study \npopulation was mostly males (80%), with a median age of 64 \nyears (range, 41\u201374). Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was \nthe main cause of background liver disease. Median tumor size \nwas 1.3 cm (range, 0.7\u20133.1) using either the RECIST or the modi\ufffefied RECIST measurements, and one patient had HCC with a seg\ufffemental bile duct invasion prior to SBRT. The locations of the HCC \nlesions were as follows: subcapsular area (26, 49.1%), perivascu\ufffelar area (15, 28.3%), near the dome (10, 18.8%), and previous \nRFA margin (2, 3.8%). All patients received a planned dose of 45 \nGy in three fractions (prescription, 91\u2013100% of isodose line) for \ntarget lesions. Only two patients (4%) were treatment-na\u00efve, and \nall other patients had received various courses of locoregional \ntherapies before receiving SBRT (median, 3 courses). However, \nadditional locoregional treatments were not performed on recur\uffferent or residual viable HCCs if SBRT was considered according to \nthe study protocol.\nFigure 2.

During the follow-up period, local recur\uffference was observed in one (1.8%) out of the 53 lesions, resulting \nin 2- and 5-year local control rates of 100% and 97.1%, respec\ufffetively (Fig. 2A; estimated local recurrence-free survival in Supple\ufffementary Fig. 1).\nAt 2 months after completion of SBRT, all lesions underwent re\ufffesponse evaluation; radiologic responses were observed in 19 \n(35.8%) and 24 (45.3%) lesions according to the RECIST and the \nmodified RECIST criteria, respectively. At 4 months, 37 (69.8%) \nand 43 (81.1%) lesions showed responses according to the RECIST \nand the modified RECIST criteria, respectively. At the final re\ufffesponse evaluation of 6 months after completion of SBRT, 44 \n(83.0%) and 49 (92.4%) lesions had achieved radiologic respons\ufffees according to the RECIST and the modified RECIST criteria, re\ufffespectively (Table 2). A representative case is shown in Supplemen\ufffetary Figure 2.\nOverall and recurrence-free survival rates \nThe median follow-up period of participants was 47.8 months \n(range, 2.9\u201370.6). By the last follow-up, 40 patients were alive. \nThe 2- and 5-year overall survival rates were 96.0% and 77.6%, \nrespectively (Fig. 2B). Thirty-six patients were diagnosed as hav\ufffeing tumor recurrences on follow-up imaging studies (CT, 26 pa\ufffetients; both CT and MRI, 10 patients). Among them, intrahepatic \n(i.e., outside the PTV) HCC recurrence was the main cause of fail\ufffeure (33 of 50 patients), and distant metastasis also developed in \neight patients during follow-up. The rates of 5-year intrahepatic \nrecurrence-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, and re\ufffecurrence-free survival were 32.0%, 83.9%, and 26.8%, respec\ufffetively (Fig. 2C-E). Multivariate analysis revealed that tumor size \nwas significantly associated with overall survival (hazard ratio \n[HR], 2.504; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.031\u20136.084; P=0.043) \nand recurrence-free survival rates (HR, 2.791; 95% CI, 1.604\u2013\n4.858; P<0.001) (Supplementary Tables 1, 2).\nTreatment-related toxicity \nSBRT-related toxicities are summarized in Table 3. All patients \nreceived the planned SBRT without any interruptions due to intol\ufffeerable side effects. Fatigue and anorexia were the most common \nacute toxicities, which were mostly mild (NCI-CTCAE grade 1) \n(Table 3).\nTwo patients (4%) experienced elevations in the Child-Pugh \nscore to \u22652. Of these, one patient had a Child-Pugh score 8 he\ufffepatic function and also showed peritoneal seeding nodules at \n2 months after completion of SBRT; this patient died due to he\ufffepatic failure at 2.9 months after SBRT. Serious adverse events \nwere reported in seven patients, including compression fracture in \nlumbar spine, variceal bleeding, cholangitis, fungal sinusitis, dys\ufffepnea, abdominal pain, and gallbladder stone (all n=1), all of \nwhich were regarded as unrelated to SBRT.\nThere were no gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding \nor perforation during follow-up. Five patients (10%) developed rib \nfractures, which did not require any specific treatment and im\ufffeproved spontaneously. Four patients (8%) developed grade 1 or 2 \nbiliary strictures, and six patients (12%) experienced grade 1 radi\ufffeation pneumonitis in the right lower lung fields (Table 3).\nTable 2.

One patient experienced hepatic failure 2 months after SBRT, \nthe cause of which was unclear. These results show clinical bene\ufffefits of using SBRT as an ablative treatment for small HCCs that are \nnot amenable to hepatic resection, RFA, or even TACE.\nMultiple prospective and retrospective studies have been con\ufffeducted to evaluate the efficacy of SBRT for HCC, with many show\ufffeing promising outcomes. However, the indications for SBRT varied, \nwith some trials including patients with portal vein tumor throm\ufffebus6,7,15 and others including patients with extrahepatic metasta\ufffesis.15 Moreover, a wide range of tumor sizes, from 1.0 cm to 23.1 \ncm, was included.6,7,9,14,15 Thus, it was difficult to draw a consistent \nconclusion on the use of SBRT for HCC. As SBRT can be used for \nvarious clinical purposes from curative to palliative aims at the \nphysician\u2019s discretion, the results of curative intent SBRT on pa\ufffetients with early stage HCCs should be analyzed if the ablative ef\ufffefect of SBRT is the primary endpoint. Therefore, we designed the \ncurrent trial by including patients with liver-confined, small (\u22645 \ncm) HCCs without macroscopic vascular invasion. Similarly, Takeda \net al.9\n conducted a phase II study on SBRT for early stage or small \n(\u22644 cm) HCCs and reported favorable outcomes in terms of 3-year \nlocal control (96.3%) and 3-year liver-related cause-specific sur\ufffevival (72.5%). Other retrospective studies using \u22645\u20136 cm of max\ufffeimum HCC tumor diameter as inclusion criteria also showed high \nlocal control rates.8,10-13,18\nIn this study, 2- and 5-year local control rates were as high as \n100% and 97.1%, respectively. Such high local control rates could \nbe explained as follows. First, participants of this study had rela\ufffetively smaller HCCs (range, 0.7\u20133.1 cm) than those of previous \nstudies. With the exception of two patients, 48 (51 lesions) were \nenrolled with recurrent HCC after prior locoregional treatments. \nHence, we decided to perform salvage therapies when typical re\ufffecurrence was observed on regular follow-up images even if the le\ufffesion was small. As tumor size is one of the most important factors \nfor local tumor control after SBRT,8,10,23-25 this may have led to the \nhigh local control rate in this study. Second, the established SBRT \nprocedures and techniques at our institution, including 4D-CT, tu\ufffemor localization on planning CT, respiratory-gated delivery, and a \nthorough image-guidance on each fraction, may have contributed \nto the improved clinical outcomes. We recently evaluated the tar\ufffegeting accuracy of our image-guided SBRT for HCC using post-ra\ufffediotherapy MRI with hepatocyte-specific contrast agent and \nfound that the set-up errors were less than 5 mm in cranio-cau\ufffedal, right-left, and anterior-posterior directions with or without \ninternal fiducial markers.19 This high local tumor control could not \nbe observed in early phase follow-up images. The timing of treat\ufffement response was evaluated by an experienced abdominal radi\ufffeologist at regular intervals (2-, 4-, 6-month after SBRT) according \nTable 3.

Response rates were less than 50% at \n2 months; however, at 6 months after completion of SBRT, they \nwere around 90% according to both the RECIST and modified RE\ufffeCIST criteria. This delayed response trend after SBRT is a poten\ufffetially valuable finding that may aid decision-making processes for \nthe management of HCC.\nAlthough most of the enrolled patients had recurrent HCCs with \na history of locoregional treatments, the overall survival rate in \nthis study was as high as 77.6% at 5 years. The most likely reason \nfor this promising result was that all patients had preserved liver \nfunctions according to the eligibility criteria. The main failure pat\ufffetern was intrahepatic recurrence, with a cumulative intrahepatic \nrecurrence of about 70%, which is similar to that of previous re\ufffeports. Given that multicentric carcinogenesis in the context of \nchronic liver disease is considered as an important cause of intra\ufffehepatic recurrence, similar outcomes were observed after SBRT for \nsolitary HCC or after RFA.9,26,27 Therefore, a regular follow-up and \nan active decision of salvage therapies are necessary to control \nrecurrent HCCs after SBRT.\nBased on the encouraging outcomes of SBRT for HCC, some \nstudies have compared the outcomes of locoregional therapies \n(e.g., hepatectomy, RFA, and TACE) with those of SBRT.28-31 Of \nthese, Hara et al. compared these two modalities in patients with \nsmall (\u22643 cm) HCCs who received curative intent treatment and \nreported that the 3-year local recurrence rates in the SBRT and \nthe RFA groups were 5.3% and 12.9% (P<0.01), respectively; \nthese differences were more notable if the HCCs were attached to \nvessels (\u22641 mm) (5.2% in the SBRT group, 25.5% in the RFA \ngroup; P<0.01).28 After propensity score matching, overall survival \nrates, cancer-specific mortality rates, and liver failure mortality \nrates were not significantly different between the two groups; \nand the authors concluded that SBRT was an acceptable alterna\ufffetive option for patients who were not candidates for RFA.28 Al\ufffethough these studies had retrospective designs, their results war\uffferant the need for well-designed clinical trials to delineate the \nclinical benefits of using SBRT as an ablative treatment for pa\ufffetients with HCC, especially for those with early stage diseases.\nThis study has the following limitations. First, the number of en\uffferolled patients was relatively small, and the number of events (lo\ufffecal recurrence: 1, death: 10) that occurred during follow-up was \nnot enough to perform statistical analysis. Therefore, it was diffi\ufffecult to find novel results on the use of SBRT for HCC, compared \nwith the previous reports. Second, HBV infection was the main \ncause (82%) of background liver disease; thus, the results of this \nstudy should be further confirmed in patients with HCCs unasso\ufffeciated with HBV. Finally, most of the enrolled patients had recur\uffferent HCCs with a history of prior locoregional treatments; thus, \nfurther studies on SBRT in treatment-na\u00efve patients with small \nHCCs are needed to confirm the role of SBRT as a curative treat\ufffement option. Nevertheless, focusing on the ablative effect of SBRT \nin patients with liver-confined, small (\u22645 cm) HCCs, presenting \nthe trends of radiologic response rates after SBRT measured at \nregular intervals, and long-term follow-up data could be consid\ufffeered valuable to report our prospective trial.\nIn conclusion, this phase II clinical trial demonstrated that SBRT \nwas well-tolerated and resulted in high local control rates and \npromising overall survival rates in patients with small (\u22645 cm) \nHCCs. Considering that tumors included in this study could not be \ntreated by curative treatment modalities, SBRT can be considered \na good alternative treatment option when hepatic resection or \nRFA cannot be applied.\nAuthors\u2019 contribution\nSang Min Yoon: Conceptualization and design, investigation, \nacquisition of data, formal analysis, methodology, writing-original \ndraft, and writing-review and editing.

The study enrolled 50 patients with a median tumor size of 2.8 cm and a median Milan criteria score of 9. The primary endpoint was the 2-year local control rate, which was found to be 98.0%. The overall survival rate at 2 years was 84.0%, and the recurrence-free survival rate was 82.0%. The study also investigated the impact of the 6-month waitlist period introduced by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) on SBRT outcomes. The authors found that the waitlist period did not significantly affect local control, overall survival, or toxicity. However, they noted that further studies are necessary to confirm their findings. The study suggests that SBRT may serve as an effective alternative to TACE or RFA for small HCCs in patients who are not eligible for surgical resection or locoregional therapies.\n\nKEYWORDS: SBRT, HCC, TACE, RFA, waitlist period, local control, overall survival, recurrence-free survival, AASLD guidelines.\n\nMETHODS:\nThe study was a single-center, prospective, phase II clinical trial that enrolled 50 patients with small HCCs who were not candidates for surgical resection or locoregional therapies like TACE or RFA. The patients underwent SBRT using a respiratory-gated volumetric-modulated arc therapy technique with a total dose of 45 Gy delivered in three consecutive daily fractions. The primary endpoint was the 2-year local control rate, and secondary endpoints included overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and toxicity. The authors also evaluated the impact of the 6-month waitlist period introduced by the AASLD guidelines on SBRT outcomes.\n\nRESULTS:\nThe study found that the 2-year local control rate was 98.0%, and the overall survival rate at 2 years was 84.0%. The median time to progression was not reached, and the median progression-free survival was not estimable. The median time to recurrence was 21.9 months, and the median recurrence-free survival was 21.9 months. The authors noted that the waitlist period did not significantly affect local control, overall survival, or toxicity. They also found that the median tumor size was 2.8 cm, and the median Milan criteria score was 9.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThe study suggests that SBRT may serve as an effective alternative to TACE or RFA for small HCCs in patients who are not eligible for surgical resection or locoregional therapies. The authors note that further studies are necessary to confirm their findings regarding the impact of the 6-month waitlist period introduced by the AASLD guidelines on SBRT outcomes. Overall, the study provides important insights into the effectiveness and safety of SBRT for small HCCs and its potential role in the management of these patients.\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE:\nThe study highlights the importance of SBRT as a local salvage treatment option for small HCCs in patients who are not eligible for surgical resection or locoregional therapies like TACE or RFA. It also underscores the need for further research to clarify the impact of the 6-month waitlist period introduced by the AASLD guidelines on SBRT outcomes. Based on the study's findings, clinicians should consider SBRT as a viable alternative to TACE or RFA for small HCCs in appropriate patients, particularly given the high local control and low toxicity rates reported here. However, it is essential to interpret these results in the context of the study's limitations and to weigh them against the available evidence from other sources before making clinical decisions. Ultimately, the decision to offer SBRT to a particular patient will depend on a variety of factors, including tumor size, location, and stage, as well as the patient's overall health and preferences.",

The criteria are traditionally\nassessed by contrast CT, which is known to be affected by\nstructural or architectural changes in cirrhotic livers. We aimed\nto compare dual-tracer (11C-acetate and 18F-FDG) PET/CT with\ncontrast CT for patient selection on the basis of the Milan cri\ufffeteria. Methods: Patients who had HCC and had undergone\nboth preoperative dual-tracer PET/CT and contrast CT within\na 1-mo interval were retrospectively studied. They then under\ufffewent either LT (n 5 22) or partial hepatectomy (PH) (n 5 21;\nHCC of # 8 cm). Imaging data were compared with data from\npostoperative pathologic analysis for accuracy in assessment\nof parameters specified by the Milan criteria (tumor size and\nextent, vascular invasion, and metastasis), TNM staging, and\npatient selection for LT. Results: Dual-tracer PET/CT per\ufffeformed equally well in both LT and PH groups for HCC detec\ufffetion (94.1% vs. 95.8%) and TNM staging (90.9% vs. 90.5%).\nContrast CT performed reasonably well in the LT group but not\nin the PH group for HCC detection (67.6% vs. 37.5%) and TNM\nstaging (54.5% vs. 28.6%). In the LT group, the sensitivity and\nspecificity of contrast CT for patient selection on the basis of\nthe Milan criteria were 43.8% and 66.7%, respectively (compa\uffferable to values in the literature); the sensitivity and specificity of\ndual-tracer PET/CT were 93.8% and 100%, respectively (both\nPs , 0.05). From the surgeon\u2019s perspective, we tended to per\ufffeform transplantation for patients with higher diagnostic certainty\n(stricter CT criteria) because of a shortage of donor grafts.\nPatients who were not transplant candidates usually underwent\nup-front hepatectomy without the benefit of reassessment con\ufffetrast CT, resulting in lower accuracies for the PH group. The\noverall sensitivity (96.8%) and specificity (91.7%) of dual-tracer\nPET/CT for patient selection for LT were significantly higher\nthan those of contrast CT (41.9% and 33.0%, respectively)\n(both Ps , 0.05). Sources of error for contrast CT were related\nto cirrhosis or previous treatment and included difficulty in\ndifferentiating cirrhotic nodules from HCC (39%) and estima\ufffetion of tumor size (14%). Overstaging of vascular invasion (4.6%)\nand extrahepatic metastases (4.6%) was infrequent. The rate\nof false-negative results of dual-tracer PET/CT was 4.7%.\nConclusion: Dual-tracer PET/CT was significantly less affected\nby cirrhotic changes than contrast CT for HCC staging and\npatient selection for LT on the basis of the Milan criteria. The\ninclusion of dual-tracer PET/CT in pretransplant workup may\nwarrant serious consideration.\nKey Words: liver transplantation; Milan criteria; 11C-acetate;\nPET/CT; contrast CT\nJ Nucl Med 2013; 54:192\u2013200\nDOI: 10.2967/jnumed.112.107516\nSurgical treatment offers the best chance of cure for pa\ufffetients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Liver resection\nis a safe option in experienced hands. However, the tumor\nrecurrence rate at 5 y after partial hepatectomy (PH) can be\nas high as 80% (1\u20133), and patients with limited functional\nhepatic reserve are not considered suitable candidates for the\nprocedure. Liver transplantation (LT) is thus regarded as the\nultimate solution for these patients.\nInitial trials of LT for HCC in the 1980s did not have a\nsatisfactory outcome, with 5-y survival rates of 18%\u201340%.\nThe low success rates were largely attributed to inappropri\ufffeate patient selection and a long waiting time because of\ngraft scarcity (4\u20137). In 1996, Mazzaferro et al. (8) proposed\nthe Milan criteria to maximize the benefit of orthotopic LT.\nThey proposed a set of selection criteria on the basis of the\nrelationship between small HCCs and better patient survival\nafter LT. They found that patients with radiologic evidence of\na single tumor with a diameter of 5 cm or less or a maximum\nof 3 tumors each with a diameter of 3 cm or less had a 5-y\nsurvival rate of 75% and a disease-free survival rate of 83%.\nTheir findings were later confirmed by other transplant re\ufffeReceived Apr. 16, 2012; revision accepted Sep. 14, 2012.\nFor correspondence or reprints contact: Tan To Cheung, Queen Mary\nHospital, 102 Pok Fu Lam Rd., Hong Kong, China.\nE-mail: tantocheung@hotmail.com\nPublished online Jan. 15, 2013.\nCOPYRIGHT \u00aa 2013 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular\nImaging, Inc.\n192 THE JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE \u2022 Vol. 54 \u2022 No. 2 \u2022 February 2013\n\nsearch groups (9). Although there are individual differences\nin these criteria, there is agreement that tumor number and\nsize are the key factors that affect patient survival.\nIn all studies of criteria for patient selection for LT, the\nimaging tool used for the selection of patients has been either\nCT or MRI. It is well known, however, that their sensitivity\nfor the detection of HCC is suboptimal in the presence of ar\ufffechitectural distortion caused by severe cirrhosis in pretrans\ufffeplant patients, mostly reported to be about 60%\u201370% (10,11).\nIn recent years, double-contrast MRI with both gadolinium\nand superparamagnetic iron oxide has been reported to\nhave significantly improved the detection of HCC in cirrhotic\nlivers, with a sensitivity of 75%\u201380% (12\u201314). Besides CT\nand MRI, PET has also been used.\nIn the past few years, dual-tracer PET/CT with 11C-acetate\n(\n11C-ACT) and 18F-FDG has been found to be useful in the\nevaluation of primary and metastatic HCC disease (15\u201317).\nBecause these 2 tracers are biochemical probes of HCCs and\nare complementary to each other, according to tumor cellular\ndifferentiation, they can not only maximize sensitivity for the\ndetection of malignant lesions but also identify tumors with\nbetter differentiation and better prognosis (18). Previous\nstudies (15,18) suggested that the capacity of dual-tracer\n(11C-ACT and 18F-FDG) PET/CT to perform a whole-body\nmetastatic survey (including bones) makes it the most com\ufffeprehensive modality for staging compared with conventional\nradiologic imaging methods. On the basis of these potential\nadvantages, we performed the present study to evaluate the\naccuracy of dual-tracer PET/CT for HCC staging and patient\nselection for LT on the basis of the Milan criteria and com\ufffepared the results with those of contrast CT.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPatients\nPatients who had undergone LT or PH (largest lesion size,\n#8 cm) for HCC at the Department of Surgery, Queen Mary Hos\ufffepital, The University of Hong Kong, between March 2004 and\nMarch 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. As a general guideline,\npatients with satisfactory liver function were offered liver resection\nas the first treatment. Patients who had poor liver function that was\nnot expected to tolerate liver resection were considered for LT.\nFor comparison of the accuracy of dual-tracer PET/CT with that\nof contrast CT for HCC staging and patient selection for LT on the\nbasis of the Milan criteria, all patients meeting the following 3\nconditions were enrolled in the study. First, the patients had received\npreoperative assessment by both triphasic CT of the abdomen and\ndual-tracer PET/CT, and the time interval between the 2 imaging\nsessions had to be less than 1 mo. Second, the patients had not\nreceived any treatment between preoperative imaging (dual\ufffetracer PET/CT and contrast CT) and surgery. For patients who\nhad undergone PH, the third condition was that there should be\nno tumor involvement of resection margins, as documented by\npostoperative histopathologic analysis.\nAll patients provided verbal and written consent after being\ngiven clear instructions and explanations about the purposes and\ndetails of this study, which was approved by the institutional ethics\ncommittee (equivalent to an institutional review board) at Hong\nKong Sanatorium and Hospital; study approval was also obtained\nfrom The University of Hong Kong.\nForty-three patients (34 men and 9 women; age range, 30\u201377 y;\nmedian age, 61 y) satisfied the inclusion criteria; 22 had LT (age\nrange, 30\u201364 y; median age, 55 y), and 21 had PH (age range, 42\u2013\n77 y; median age, 65 y). Thirty-seven patients were hepatitis B\nvirus carriers, and 3 were hepatitis C virus carriers. The patients\u2019\nclinical and biochemical data are shown in Table 1.

The median time in\ufffetervals between imaging and surgery were 35 d for CT and 21 d for\nPET/CT. Five patients in the LT group and 1 patient in the PH\ngroup had received bridging treatment by transcatheter arterial\nchemoembolization (TACE) before preoperative assessment by\ncontrast CT and dual-tracer PET/CT. One patient had contrast\nCT and dual-tracer PET/CT before and after TACE.\nDual-Tracer PET/CT and Contrast CT\nThe dual-tracer PET/CT protocol was previously described\n(15,16). All patients fasted for at least 6 h, and the blood glucose\nconcentration was determined before the injection of PET radio\ufffepharmaceuticals (all had glucose levels of ,8 mmol/L). 11C-ACT\n(440\u2013590 MBq; 7.4 MBq/kg of body weight) was administered\nintravenously, and limited whole-body (from base of skull to up\ufffeper thigh) imaging was performed at 20 min after injection. Data\nacquisition with an integrated in-line PET/CT scanner (Biograph\nLSO or Biograph 16 LSO HI-REZ; Siemens) began with CT (no\ncontrast agent, 130 kV, 110\u2013115 mA, 2-mm pitch, and 1-s tube ro\ufffetation); CT was followed by PET with a 2-min emission acquisi\ufffetion time and a 16.2-cm axial field of view per position. About\n15 min after the completion of 11C-ACT imaging, 330\u2013520 MBq\n(6.3 MBq/kg of body weight) of 18F-FDG were injected intrave\ufffenously. PET/CT imaging with the same positions and acquisition\nsettings began at 60 min after 18F-FDG administration.\nAll CT studies were performed with a multidetector CT scanner\n(Light Speed 16; GE Healthcare) and standard unenhanced and\n3-phase contrast-enhanced protocols (collimation, 1.5\u20132.0 mm; image\nreconstruction interval, 5 mm) for dynamic evaluation of the liver.\nEnhanced images were acquired after intravenous contrast agent\ninjection (Omnipaque 300; 2 mL/kg; GE Healthcare). Guided by\nan early arterial phase automatically acquired with a 180\u2013Houns\ufffefield unit increase in attenuation, with reference to the abdominal\naorta at the level of the liver dome, a late arterial phase followed 12\ns later, and then a portal venous phase followed 40 s later. Delayed\ufffephase imaging was performed when better delineation of lesion ex\ufffetent was needed or to check for capsular enhancement.\nInterpretation According to Milan Criteria\nIn the present study, a patient was classified as either satisfying\nor not satisfying the Milan criteria for transplantation (a single\nHCC lesion of #5 cm or a maximum of 3 HCC lesions of #3 cm\neach, no macroscopic vascular invasion, and no extrahepatic me\ufffetastasis) on the basis of preoperative imaging with dual-tracer\n(11C-ACT and 18F-FDG) PET/CT or contrast CT.\nAn intrahepatic lesion (liver or intrahepatic tumor thrombus) on\nPET images was considered to be an HCC on the basis of focally\nincreased 11C-ACT or 18F-FDG metabolism and a well-defined\nmargin compared with the background liver parenchyma, as visu\ufffeally judged by 3 nuclear medicine physicians (each with 7\u201310 y of\nexperience in dual-tracer PET/CT). They read the images inde\ufffependently before reaching a consensus on the final diagnosis,\nwhich was supported by a semiquantitative evaluation (lesion-to\ufffeliver maximum standardized uptake value [SUV] ratio, .1.20).\nThe lesion boundary was delineated in 3 dimensions automatically\nby the second derivative \u201cPET edge\u201d computational method with\nMIMContouring V4.1.8 commercial software (MIM Software, Inc.).\nThe longest diameter of the lesion calculated by this computational\nalgorithm was regarded as the \u201cfunctional\u201d lesion size on PET.\nAn extrahepatic lesion (extrahepatic tumor thrombi or metas\ufffetasis) was assessed with the same evaluation methods, except that\nonly the maximum SUV of the lesion was measured (the ratio was\nnot necessary in the absence of background liver activity), and was\nconsidered to be an HCC if the maximum SUV was greater than\n2.5 on either 18F-FDG or 11C-ACT PET images.\nCT studies were interpreted independently by experienced radio\ufffelogists without prior knowledge of the dual-tracer PET/CT\nfindings. A lesion was considered positive for HCC if it showed\ncontrast enhancement during the arterial phase and washout with\nisoattenuation or hypoattenuation during the portal venous or\ndelayed equilibrium phase. A mosaic pattern and delayed capsular\nenhancement were also taken as ancillary signs of a positive diag\ufffenosis. The \u201cphysical\u201d lesion size was regarded as the longest ortho\ufffegonal diameter on the transaxial or reconstructed sagittal or coronal\nCT images. Other information, such as vascular tumor involvement\nand metastases, was likewise recorded independently.\nThe imaging findings were compared with the results of histo\ufffepathologic analysis of explanted livers and resected liver and ex\ufffetrahepatic specimens (lymph nodes, vessels, and peritoneum), if\nany, because histopathologic analysis was used as the reference\nstandard. Specific parameters recorded for each patient were di\ufffeagnosis of individual liver lesions (HCCs, dysplastic nodules, and\nregenerative nodules), size, location (liver segment), number of\nlesions, tumor cellular grade or differentiation, vascular thrombosis\nwith or without tumor involvement, nontumor liver tissue status, and\nextrahepatic metastasis. A lesion seen on contrast CT or PET/CT was\nconsidered to be a true-positive lesion if it was confirmed to be\nHCC by microscopic histopathologic analysis and was in the same\nlocation and segment indicated by gross pathology.\nStatistical Analysis\nQuantitative comparisons between contrast CT and 18F-FDG\nPET/CT, 11C-ACT PET/CT, and dual-tracer PET/CT were made\nwith the x2 test for the following aspects: sensitivity for the de\ufffetection of HCCs and small (#2-cm) HCCs, HCC staging (TNM\nsystem; (19)), and patient selection for LT according to the Milan\ncriteria. P values of less than 0.05 signified statistical significance.\nHistopathologic analysis was used as the reference standard.\nRESULTS\nPathologic Examination\nThe diagnosis of HCC was confirmed in all patients, and\neach patient had at least 1 HCC lesion found by postoperative\npathologic analysis.\nLT Group. Twenty-two patients in the LT group had a\ntotal of 34 HCC lesions with a median tumor size of 2.5 cm\n(range, 1.0\u20138.0 cm). Cirrhosis, dysplastic nodules, and re\ufffegenerative nodules were found in all explanted livers. One\npatient had intrahepatic portal vein tumor thrombosis. All\nspecimens were examined, including 4 specimens (a 2.0-cm\nportal node, a peritoneal biopsy at a location with signifi\ufffecant mesenteric stranding, and 2 portal venous thrombi)\nfrom 4 patients with suspect findings on CT, and no extra\ufffehepatic metastasis was found. Histopathologic evidence ob\ufffetained after LT showed that 16 patients (72.7%) met the\nMilan criteria and that 6 patients (27.3%) did not. Among\nthe latter 6 patients, 3 had tumors larger than 5 cm (6.5, 7,\nand 8 cm) and 3 had multicentric HCC, each with 1 lesion\n194 THE JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE \u2022 Vol. 54 \u2022 No. 2 \u2022 February 2013\n\nlarger than 3 cm (3.5, 4, and 5 cm). According to the TNM\nstaging system, 13 patients (59.1%) were at stage I, 8 patients\n(36.4%) were at stage II, and 1 patient (4.5%) was at stage III.\nPH Group. Twenty-one patients in the PH group had a\ntotal of 24 HCC lesions with a median tumor size of 2.8 cm\n(range, 1.0\u20137.5 cm). One patient had vascular tumor inva\ufffesion of a portal vein branch. All resected liver specimens\nshowed moderate cirrhotic features, with dysplastic and re\ufffegenerative nodules. On the basis of the findings for the re\ufffesected liver specimens and the assumption that all tumors\nwere removed (all with clear resection margins), 15 patients\n(71.4%) met the Milan criteria and 6 patients (28.6%) did\nnot. Each of the 15 patients who met the Milan criteria had\nonly 1 tumor, and these tumors were smaller than 5 cm (range,\n1\u20134.5 cm). Of the 6 patients who did not meet the criteria, 3\nhad tumors larger than 5 cm (5.4, 7.0, and 7.5 cm); 2 had\nmulticentric HCC, with 1 lesion being larger than 3 cm (3.3\nand 3.5 cm); and 1 had a tumor measuring 2.5 cm and tumor\ninvasion of a portal vein branch. According to the TNM\nstaging system, 16 patients (76.2%) were at stage I, 3\npatients (14.3%) were at stage II, and 2 patients (9.5%)\nwere at stage III.\nWhen the 2 groups were combined, there were a total of\n58 HCC lesions, including 23 small HCC lesions (1\u20131.5 cm:\nn 5 11; .1.5\u20132 cm: n 5 12; median size, 1.5 cm). Twenty\ufffeseven HCC lesions, including 15 small HCC lesions (,2 cm),\nwere well differentiated; 31 HCC lesions, including 8 small\nHCC lesions, were moderately differentiated. No lesion\nwas classified as poorly differentiated by histopathologic\nanalysis.\nPreoperative CT and PET/CT Imaging\nDetection of Malignant Lesions. The lesion- and patient\ufffebased sensitivity for the detection of malignant lesions by\ntriphasic contrast CT and 18F-FDG, 11C-ACT, and dual-tracer\nPET/CT in the LT group is shown in Table 2. In the LT\ngroup, 11C-ACT PET/CT was more sensitive than 18F-FDG\nPET/CT and contrast CT for the detection of HCC (all Ps ,\n0.05). Figure 1 shows a typical patient with 3 liver nodules\navid for 11C-ACT but not 18F-FDG; each was confirmed to\nbe a well-differentiated HCC smaller than 3 cm in explanted\nliver. Two patients with false-negative 11C-ACT PET/CT\nresults had received bridging treatment by TACE before pre\ufffeoperative imaging. The pathology of the explanted livers\nof these 2 patients showed significant tumor necrosis and\na small amount of viable tumor tissue. The sensitivity for\nthe detection of malignant lesions in the PH group is also\nshown in Table 2. Again, 11C-ACT PET/CT was more sen\ufffesitive than contrast CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT (all Ps , 0.05).\nContrast CT was found to have an overall lesion-based\nsensitivity of 55.2% (Table 2), with individual detection sen\ufffesitivities of 67.6% in the LT group and 37.5% in the PH group\n(P , 0.05 for the 2 groups). There was no significant differ\ufffeence in the sensitivity of 11C-ACT and 18F-FDG PET/CT\nbetween the 2 groups (both Ps . 0.05). The overall sensitivity\nof 18F-FDG PET/CT was low (32.8%), as already shown by\nan earlier report (16) indicating that early HCCs were more\noften tumor cells of a younger generation and with better\ndifferentiation and that their metabolic avidity favored\n11C-ACT instead of 18F-FDG.\nTo evaluate the ability of the present study to delineate\nsmall HCCs, we analyzed a subgroup of small tumors (1\u20132 cm;\nmean 6 SD, 1.6 6 0.28 cm). The sensitivity for the detection\nof small HCCs by 11C-ACT PET/CT was 87.0%, which was\ncomparable to its overall sensitivity (93.1%) (P . 0.05)\n(Table 2). The sensitivities for the detection of small HCCs\nby 18F-FDG PET/CT and contrast CT were 17.4% and\n43.5%, respectively; these sensitivities were significantly\nlower than their overall sensitivities (both Ps , 0.05). Al\ufffemost two-thirds of the small HCCs were well differentiated\n(15/23; 65.2%). A total of 12 dysplastic nodules ($1 cm;\nmean 6 SD, 1.5 6 0.34 cm) were identified by postopera\ufffetive pathologic analysis. 18F-FDG PET/CT and 11C-ACT\nPET/CT yielded true-negative results for all dysplastic nod\ufffeules (specificity, 100%). Contrast CT yielded false-positive\nresults for 2 dysplastic nodules (1.5 and 2.0 cm) with mild\narterial-phase contrast enhancement; they were misdiag\ufffenosed as small HCCs (specificity, 83.3%). 11C-ACT PET/CT correctly identified 1 patient in the LT\ngroup as having tumor thrombi along an intrahepatic portal\nvein and a main portal vein (seen as 11C-ACT\u2013avid hyper\ufffemetabolic lesions), but the results of contrast CT were in\ufffedeterminate because of the lack of contrast enhancement\nwithin the thrombi. 11C-ACT PET/CT yielded true-negative\nTABLE 2\nSensitivities of PET/CT and Contrast CT for Detection of Malignant Lesions*\nLT group PH group Overall\nImaging By patient By lesion By patient By lesion All lesions Small HCCs\nContrast CT 77.3% (17/22) 67.6% (23/34) 42.9% (9/21) 37.5% (9/24) 55.2% (32/58) 43.5% (10/23)\n18F-FDG PET/CT 40.9% (9/22) 32.4% (11/34) 38.1% (8/21) 33.3% (8/24) 32.8% (19/58) 17.4% (4/23)\n11C-ACT PET/CT 90.9% (20/22) 91.2% (31/34) 95.2% (20/21) 95.8% (23/24) 93.1% (54/58) 87.0% (20/23)\nDual-tracer PET/CT 95.5% (21/22) 94.1% (32/34) 95.2% (20/21) 95.8% (23/24) 94.8% (55/58) 91.3% (21/23)\n*Pathologic analysis was used as reference standard.\nDUAL-TRACER PET/CT AND LIVER TRANSPLANT \u2022 Cheung et al. 195\n\nresults for 4 patients for whom extrahepatic metastasis was\nsuggested by CT (2 with vascular tumor thrombi, 1 with an\nenlarged portal node, and 1 with a mesenteric metastasis).\nBoth 11C-ACT and 18F-FDG PET/CT and contrast CT\nrevealed no macroscopic vascular invasion or extrahepatic\nmetastasis in the PH group, but there was pathologic evi\ufffedence of vascular invasion in 1 patient\u2019s resected liver spec\ufffeimen (all types of imaging yielded false-negative results).\nTNM Staging and Patient Selection for LT According to\nMilan Criteria. Table 3 shows the accuracy of the 4 imag\ufffeing modalities (triphasic contrast CT, 11C-ACT PET/CT,\n18F-FDG PET/CT, and dual-tracer PET/CT) for TNM stag\ufffeing (19) in the 2 groups. 11C-ACT PET/CT was more accurate\nfor staging than contrast CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT in both\ngroups of patients (all Ps , 0.05). Figure 2 shows that CT had\ndifficulty in differentiating dysplastic nodules from small\nHCCs in a typical patient with cirrhosis. The differentiation\nmight have been more uncertain in patients who had under\ufffegone TACE treatment. However, changes after TACE seemed\nto have little effect on PET images (Fig. 3). Although, on the\nbasis of the contrast CT findings after TACE, this patient did\nnot meet the Milan criteria, TACE should have had at least\na partial effect, as reflected by the improved clinical and bio\ufffechemical parameters. With concordant findings from PET/CT\nand other favorable clinical factors, including the availability\nof a graft, the patient subsequently underwent LT. The results\nof pathologic analysis agreed with the PET/CT findings, in\ufffedicating that this patient met the Milan criteria.\nFigure 4 shows the only lesion suspected of being a high\ufffegrade dysplastic nodule on the basis of mild 11C-ACT avid\ufffeity (lesion-to-liver maximum SUV ratio, 1.15). PET performed\n4 mo later revealed normalized metabolism, suggestive of\nregression (the patient was receiving antiviral treatment).\nNonetheless, PET performed 20 mo thereafter revealed a\nwell-defined 11C-ACT\u2013avid nodule in the same location.\nWithout knowledge of the PET findings, the pathologist\nwho examined the explanted liver described this nodule as\n\u201chaving features of a well-differentiated HCC (1.8 cm) that\nwas transformed from a high-grade dysplastic nodule.\u201d\nTable 4 summarizes the abilities of PET/CT and contrast\nCT to correctly select patients for LT on the basis of the Milan\ncriteria. Assessment was made in terms of 4 elements\u2014\nlesion size, lesion number, intrahepatic vascular invasion,\nand extrahepatic metastasis. 11C-ACT PET/CT was signif\ufffeicantly more accurate in patient selection than contrast\nCT and 18F-FDG PET/CT (all Ps , 0.05).

The incre\ufffemental values of 11C-ACT PET/CT over contrast CT for\npatient inclusion and exclusion were 51.6% and 58.3%,\nrespectively. Sources of error (nonexclusive) for contrast\nCT in patient inclusion and exclusion were indeterminate\nor negative conclusion in differentiating cirrhotic nodules\n(dysplastic nodules, regenerative nodules, or changes after\nTACE) from HCCs (39.5%; 17/43), inaccurate account of\nlesion size (14%; 6/43) or number (2.3%; 1/43), and over\ufffestaging because of a false-positive diagnosis of vascular\n(4.7%; 2/43) or extrahepatic (4.7%; 2/43) metastasis. Discor\ufffedance between 11C-ACT PET/CT and pathologic findings\nwas found for 3 patients with false-negative results; the\nresults for 2 of these patients were determined to be negative\nby both tracers. These 2 patients had tumor necrosis with\nminimal residual tumor tissue after TACE.\nDISCUSSION\nAfter the introduction of the conventional Milan criteria in\n1996, the results of orthotopic LT improved substantially\nthrough careful patient selection (8,9). The objectives of the\ncriteria are to include more patients with a good prognosis\nfor LT and to prevent a poor prognosis by avoiding trans\ufffeplantation in patients who do not meet the criteria. The cri\ufffeteria enable objective patient selection and provide a fair\nsystem for allocation of the limited supply of liver grafts.\nWith 10 y of experience, the Milan group achieved a patient\nsurvival rate of over 70% in 300 LTs by adopting the criteria\n(20). Equally good results were observed in the rest of the\nworld when a similar principle was followed, although the\ncriteria might have been expanded at some centers (21,22).\nThe Milan criteria feature 2 independent predictors of\npatient survival and disease recurrence\u2014tumor size and\nFIGURE 2. CT showed mildly contrast-enhanced nodule in seg\ufffement IVb impinging on gallbladder, suggestive of HCC (arrowhead),\nwith no abnormal metabolism on 11C-ACT PET/CT (or on 18F-FDG\nPET/CT; data not shown). Instead, 11C-ACT\u2013avid lesion (arrow) was\nfound in segment V. Results of pathologic analysis for excised liver\nconfirmed well-differentiated HCC (3.6 cm) in right lobe (segments V\nand VI) and dysplastic nodule (2.0 cm) in left lobe (segment IVb),\nadjacent to gallbladder.\nFIGURE 3.

In excised liver, 2\nsmall HCCs (2.4 and 2.7 cm), concordant\nwith 2 11C-ACT\u2013avid lesions, and a few ne\ufffecrotic nodules without malignant cells were\nfound.

The most accurate measurement of tumor\nsize and number is obtained by examination of pathologic\nspecimens, but this information can be acquired only after\ntransplantation. Contrast CT has been used as a standard\nassessment tool for this purpose, but its accuracy has not\nbeen greatly improved even by advanced multidetector CT\nwith fast acquisition and computation capabilities (21,23).\nThe typical triphasic pattern of arterial enhancement may\nnot always be present in small HCCs on CT scans. On the\nother hand, true tumors are often obscured by a background\nof cirrhosis intermixed with regenerative and dysplastic\nnodules. Furthermore, other hypervascular lesions, such\nas a small hemangioma, an inflammatory nodule, or a focal\narterioportal shunt, may mimic small HCCs. False-positive\nand false-negative nodules are common findings. It has\nbeen suggested that only 10%\u201330% of nodules smaller than\n2 cm on the arterial phase of contrast CT represent HCCs in\nhighly cirrhotic livers (24). On the other hand, it was reported\nthat ultrasound imaging, CT, and MR imaging revealed\nhypervascularity in 34%, 52%, and 47% of HCCs of different\ngrades and with a median size of 1.6 cm, respectively. MR\nimaging, especially dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR im\ufffeaging and double-contrast MR imaging, has been reported\nto be better than CT for the overall detection of HCCs (12\u2013\n14,24,25). However, a Korean study showed that multide\ufffetector CT, superparamagnetic iron oxide MR imaging, and\ndouble-contrast MR imaging had comparable accuracies\nfor assessing the appropriateness of patients for LT on the\nbasis of the Milan criteria (12).\nTumor extension is often over- or underestimated (27%\u2013\n50%) in cirrhotic livers; this was the case in the original\nstudy that proposed the Milan criteria (8,26,27). Several\nlarge series of studies on the sensitivity of CT (helical and\nmultidetector CT) in patients with cirrhotic HCC treated by\nLT reported a sensitivity range of 60%\u201370% on a patient basis\n(23,28\u201330). Our result in the LT group was 73.3% (67.6% on\na lesion basis), in agreement with the results in the literature.\nThe only difference is the lower sensitivity (42.9%; 37.5% on\na lesion basis) in the PH group.\nWe reviewed these studies and found 2 possible reasons\nfor the results. The first reason is related to the CT diagnos\ufffetic criteria. Some of these studies, in addition to the typical\ncontrast enhancement pattern, included lesions without\narterial-phase enhancement but with delayed-phase wash\ufffeout. Therefore, studies that adopted this wider margin for\ndiagnosis also reported a large number of false-positive nodules\n(up to 59%) (30). The second reason is based on the first rea\ufffeson; the stricter criteria in the present study tended to include\npatients with a greater certainty of diagnostic accuracy but\nalso tended to exclude more patients with less certainty. In\nview of the severe shortage of liver grafts in Hong Kong, we\nembrace a more cautious attitude so that preference is given to\npatients who are expected to have more definitive CT results.\nPatients who are not LT candidates because of various\nindividual factors will undergo PH as a definitive treatment\nas soon as the surgery can be arranged. Some patients with\nless definitive CT findings will also undergo tumor resec\ufffetion as long as the clinical diagnosis is highly suggestive of\nHCC. Therefore, we speculate that a \u201cpreselection\u201d element\nmight have contributed partly to the lower performance of\ncontrast CT in the PH group.\nPatient selection on the basis of the Milan criteria added\nanother set of conditions to the criteria for lesion detection.\nCT findings agreed with pathologic findings for 43.8% of\nFIGURE 4. Carrier of hepatitis B virus in LT\ngroup with suspected liver nodule was eval\ufffeuated and monitored for 2 y by dual-tracer\nPET/CT (3 times). 11C-ACT PET/CT image in\nJuly 2007 showed 11C-ACT\u2013avid lesion with\nill-defined margins in segment V, suggestive\nof early HCC or high-grade dysplastic nod\ufffeule. Activity of lesion was normalized 4 mo\nlater but reappeared in 2009.\nTABLE 4\nAccuracies of PET/CT and Contrast CT in Selecting Patients for LT on Basis of Milan Criteria*\nSatisfying Milan criteria Not satisfying Milan criteria\nImaging LT group PH group LT group PH group\nContrast CT 43.8% (7/16) 40.0% (6/15) 66.7% (4/6) 0.0% (0/6)\n18F-FDG PET/CT 25.0% (4/16) 26.7% (4/15) 50.0% (3/6) 50.0% (3/6)\n11C-ACT PET/CT 87.5% (14/16) 100.0% (15/15) 100.0% (6/6) 83.3% (5/6)\nDual-tracer PET/CT 93.8% (15/16) 100.0% (15/15) 100.0% (6/6) 83.3% (5/6)\n*Pathologic analysis was used as reference standard.\n198 THE JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE \u2022 Vol. 54 \u2022 No. 2 \u2022 February 2013\n\nthe patients in the LT group and for 40% of the patients in\nthe PH group. These rates are similar to that reported in a\nGerman study (41%) (27). The performance of 11C-ACT\nPET/CT in the LT group was similar to that in the PH group,\na result that is not surprising because it is relatively indepen\ufffedent of benign anatomic or structural variations. As shown\nin Tables 2\u20134, sensitivity for the detection of malignant le\ufffesions, staging accuracy, and consistency with the Milan cri\ufffeteria were similar (.90%) in the 2 groups when dual-tracer\nPET/CT was used. Therefore, the data suggested that patients\nin the PH group could have been given equal consideration\nfor LT had the dual-tracer PET/CT findings been used as\nthe criterion evaluating tool. This approach would definitely\naffect management decisions. Nonetheless, more data are\nneeded for further validation.\nIn the last decade, Ho et al. studied the complementary\nnature of 2 biochemical PET tracers, 11C-ACT and 18F-FDG,\nfor the detection of primary and metastatic HCCs (15,16).\nThey found that de novo synthesis of free fatty acids is upre\ufffegulated in well-differentiated HCCs and that acetate (11C\ufffeACT), a precursor of acetyl-coenzyme A, may be the preferred\nmetabolic substrate. As HCC cells become more malignant\nand dedifferentiated, their biochemical substrates for growth\nalso progressively shift to 18F-FDG, a marker of glycolysis.\nThe sensitivity of an individual tracer for the detection of\nmalignant lesions is thus dependent on tumor cell differen\ufffetiation, and the dual tracers are complementary. The sensi\ufffetivity of 11C-ACT PET alone for the detection of malignant\nlesions is approximately 87% for HCCs of intermediate and\nsmall sizes. Because early or small HCCs tend to be well\ndifferentiated, 11C-ACT is the more important tracer for\nPET imaging. In the present study, the sensitivity of 11C\ufffeACT PET/CT for the detection of small HCCs (1\u20132 cm) was\n87.0%. This rate is similar to those reported in previous\nstudies, but it was derived from a different, independent\ngroup of patients (31). It was also significantly higher than\nthose achieved by 18F-FDG PET/CT (17.4%) and contrast\nCT (43.5%) in the present study.\nOur results showed that regenerative nodules were not\navid for either of the 2 tracers and that they could be dis\ufffetinguished from HCCs. Dysplastic nodules were frequently\nfound in pathologic specimens, but only 1 lesion was retro\ufffespectively suspected of being a high-grade dysplastic nod\ufffeule that showed mild 11C-ACT avidity before LT (Fig. 4).\nMore data are needed to evaluate the relationship between\n11C-ACT and high-grade dysplastic nodules. Previously\npublished data suggested that structural changes secondary\nto cirrhosis do not affect the PET diagnosis as much as they\ndo the CT diagnosis.\nVascular invasion and histopathologic grading are 2 other\npredictors of outcomes for LT in patients with cirrhotic\nHCC. These have been regarded as providing valuable prog\ufffenostic information but otherwise are not available until after\nsurgery. With dual-tracer PET/CT, these parameters are\nvaluable for preoperative treatment planning (18). Although 11C-ACT was shown to have superior sensitivity for the de\ufffetection of malignant lesions throughout the present study,\nthe complementary role of 18F-FDG should not be under\ufffeestimated, because an earlier report suggested that some\nmetastatic HCC lesions may dedifferentiate even if the pri\ufffemary HCC tumor initially comprises 11C-ACT\u2013avid, well\ufffedifferentiated cell types (15). Therefore, 18F-FDG is needed\nfor a complete assessment of all of the Milan criteria (me\ufffetastasis). Moreover, 18F-FDG, as a marker of dedifferentiated\nHCC tumor pathology, has been shown by other researchers\nto be a predictor of tumor recurrence and a less favorable\noutcome after transplantation (32).\nIn the present study, we purposely included a group of\nrecipients of PH for comparison. We assumed that there\nwas no HCC disease in the unresected livers\u2014the only part\nof the study without pathologic proof (but contrast CT and\nPET/CT findings were negative). Although recurrence was\nseen in some of these patients during follow-up, they were\nnot considered different from other PH patients in whom\nrecurrence was attributed to de novo metachronous tumor\ndevelopment, occult tumor seeding, or micrometastasis via\nportovenous sinuses or shunts and not to suboptimal pre\ufffeoperative imaging assessment.\nAnother limitation is that the synthesis of 11C-ACT requires\ntechnical expertise and an on-site cyclotron. With significant\nimprovements in PET and cyclotron technologies in the past\ndecade, many \u201cbaby cyclotrons\u201d have become available and af\ufffefordable. Because 18F-FDG is far from being a universal tracer\nfor all tumors, the complementary use of a good tracer, such as\n11C-ACT, for liver cancer should be encouraged.\nCONCLUSION\nThis is the first study to use dual-tracer PET/CT for the\nevaluation of patients with HCC in a setting in which the\nMilan criteria are used to select patients for LT. The basic\nprinciple underlying these criteria is the ability of imaging\nto accurately define the true stage of disease. In the presence\nof chronic and cirrhotic liver disease, an imaging technique\nthat is not so affected by the structural changes of the back\ufffeground parenchyma is needed. The results of the present\nstudy confirmed that dual-tracer PET/CT works in keeping\nwith this principle because of the use of a pair of functional\nprobes that are known to be less affected by structural changes\nand not compromised by size, that have complementary bio\ufffechemical sensitivities to cover a wide range of tumor cells\nwith different degrees of differentiation or dedifferentiation,\nand that can be used to perform a metastatic survey. All of\nthese elements contribute to the potential of this technique\nfor better patient selection. To understand the logistics, cost,\nand feasibility of this imaging technique in pretransplant\nworkup for patients with HCC, large-scale research needs\nto be conducted.\nDISCLOSURE\nThe costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part\nby the payment of page charges.

            "response": "This article compares the effectiveness of liver transplantation for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the 1990s versus more recently. The authors analyze data from two hospitals in Hong Kong, one public hospital and one private hospital, to determine if the incidence of HCC has increased over time and whether the indications for liver transplantation have become more liberal. They also examine the role of imaging techniques such as contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CT) in diagnosing and staging HCC. The study finds that the incidence of HCC has indeed increased, particularly among male patients, and that the indications for liver transplantation have become more liberal. The authors suggest that this may be due to improvements in imaging technology, allowing for earlier detection of HCC, as well as advances in surgical technique and perioperative care. They also note that while CECT remains the preferred imaging modality for initial screening, MRI and PET/CT may be useful in select cases, particularly for identifying satellite lesions or evaluating tumor biology. Overall, the study highlights the importance of ongoing monitoring and surveillance for HCC, as well as the need for continued research into optimal imaging strategies and treatment approaches for this complex and challenging disease.",

Ko1, Mi Sook Gwak1 & Gaab Soo Kim1\nTo evaluate the association between sarcopenia and tumor recurrence after living donor liver \ntransplantation (LDLT) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we analyzed 92 \nmales who underwent LDLT for treating HCC beyond the Milan criteria. Sarcopenia was defined when \nthe height-normalized psoas muscle thickness was <15.5mm/m at the L3 vertebra level on computed \ntomography based on an optimum stratification method using the Gray\u2019s test statistic. Survival analysis \nwas performed with death as a competing risk event. The primary outcome was post-transplant HCC \nrecurrence. The median follow-up time was 36 months. There was a 9% increase in recurrence risk \nper unit decrease in height-normalized psoas muscle thickness. Twenty-six (36.1%) of 72 sarcopenic \nrecipients developed HCC recurrence, whereas only one (5.0%) of 20 non-sarcopenic recipients \ndeveloped HCC recurrence. Recurrence risk was greater in sarcopenic patients in univariable analysis \n(hazard ratio [HR]=8.06 [1.06\u201316.70], p=0.044) and in multivariable analysis (HR=9.49 [1.18\u201376.32], \np=0.034). Greater alpha-fetoprotein and microvascular invasion were also identified as independent \nrisk factors. Incorporation of sarcopenia improved the model fitness and prediction power of the \nestimation model. In conclusion, sarcopenia appears to be one of the important host factors modulating \ntumor recurrence risk after LDLT for advanced HCC.\nLiver transplantation is an established therapeutic option to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) because it \nremoves both the tumor and surrounding premalignant parenchymal tissues. However, severe graft shortage lim\ufffeits the candidacy for transplantation to patients with early stage HCC in whom the recurrence risk is relatively low \nand thus a lower probability of graft failure is predicted1\n. As one way to overcome the graft shortage, liver trans\ufffeplantation of grafts from living donors, so-called living donor liver transplantation (LDLT), allows more advanced \nHCC to be treated because living donors decide to donate at their own will and generally request permission to \ndonate their grafts to a specific recipient without graft competition2\n. In this regard, better understanding of factors \ncontributing to tumor recurrence of this highly invasive cancer is required to compensate for the high recurrence \nrisk and improve post-transplant outcomes after LDLT.\nIn addition to tumor biology, patient functional status also affects tumor recurrence after treatment. \nSarcopenia, or skeletal muscle deterioration, is frequently encountered in patients with end-stage liver disease, \nwith a reported incidence ranging up to 70%, and is considered an important parameter indicating impaired \nfunctional status2\u20135\n. Previous studies have demonstrated that sarcopenia is associated with higher risk of HCC \nrecurrence after liver resection6\u20138\n.

In this study, we evaluated the relationship between sarcopenia and tumor recurrence \nafter LDLT in patients with advanced HCC exceeding the Milan criteria (HCC beyond the Milan criteria).\nResults\nCharacteristics of the subjects. The primary etiologies of HCC in the subjects were hepatitis B virus \n(n=78), hepatitis C virus (n=8), alcohol (n=3), and unknown (n=3). In the 92 patients, 91 presented with \nchronic liver cirrhosis, and 1 presented with acute-on-chronic liver failure. There were no recipients with acute \nliver failure or emergent surgery. Clinical characteristics of the two groups are described in Table\u00a01. Body mass \nindex was significantly lower in sarcopenic recipients than in non-sarcopenic recipients (23.8 vs. 25.5 kg/m2\n, \np=0.003). Accordingly, the proportion of recipients with <1.0% graft-to-recipient weight ratio was significantly \nlower in sarcopenic recipients (43.1% vs. 70.0%, p=0.033). Age was significantly greater in sarcopenic recipi\ufffeents (54 vs. 51 years, p=0.047). In terms of tumor characteristics, there were no significant differences between \nthe two groups in alpha-fetoprotein level, tumor number/size, microvascular invasion, bile duct invasion, and \nnon-tumor liver cirrhosis. Although statistical significance was not achieved, there was a trend toward a lower \nproportion of Edmonson grade III-IV (5.6% vs. 20.0%, p=0.065) in sarcopenic recipients.\nSarcopenic \n(n=72)\nNon-sarcopenic \n(n=20) p\nGraft factor\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Donor age (years) 28 (22\u201335) 31 (24\u201348) 0.082\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Male donor 52 (72.2) 10 (50.0) 0.061\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Graft-to-recipient weight ratio < 1.0% 31 (43.1) 14 (70.0) 0.033\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Macrosteatosis \u2265 5% 35 (48.6) 7 (35.0) 0.280\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cold ischemia time (minutes) 85 (63\u2013101) 85 (68\u2013107) 0.450\nRecipient factors\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Age (years) 54 (51\u201359) 51 (49\u201355) 0.047\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Body mass index (kg/m2\n) 23.8 (21.8\u201325.5) 25.5 (24.6\u201328.2) 0.003\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Diagnosed diabetes 25 (34.7) 8 (40.0) 0.663\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MELD score\u226520 10 (13.9) 0 (0) 0.111\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sodium level (mmol/L) 139 (135\u2013141) 140 (138\u2013143) 0.027\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hepatic encephalopathy\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0None 62 (86.1) 19 (95.0)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Grade I\u2013II (vs. none) 10 (13.9) 1 (5.0) 0.445\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Grade III\u2013IV 0 0 \u2014\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Refractory ascites 14 (19.4) 1 (5.0) 0.177\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pretransplant CRRT 0 0 \u2014\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pretransplant tumor treatment history 56 (77.8) 14 (70.0) 0.555\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0High sensitive C-reactive protein (mg/L) 0.47 (0.17\u20131.16) 0.27 (0.10\u20130.69) 0.214\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio 2.01 (1.35\u20133.73) 1.52 (1.03\u20132.80) 0.085\nSurgical factors\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Operative time > 10hours 30 (41.7) 10 (50.0) 0.506\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perioperative RBC transfusion > 6 units 22 (30.6) 5 (25.0) 0.629\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tacrolimus trough concentration>10ng/mL 32 (44.4) 10 (50.0) 0.659\nTumor biology\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0AFP (log-transformed ng/mL)* 3.98 (2.25\u20135.59) 2.87 (1.70\u20134.93) 0.196\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tumor number 0.663\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Solitary 6 (8.3) 3 (15.0)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02\u20133 (vs. solitary) 17 (23.6) 4 (20.0)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0>3 (vs. solitary) 49 (68.1) 13 (65.0)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tumor size (cm) 3.3 (2.5\u20135.3) 3.2 (2.3\u20135.0) 0.381\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Microvascular invasion 42 (58.3) 14 (70.0) 0.344\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bile duct invasion 5 (4.7) 1 (5.0) >0.99\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Edmonson grade III-IV (vs. grade I-II) 4 (5.6) 4 (20.0) 0.065\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Non-tumor liver cirrhosis 63 (87.5) 16 (80.0) 0.469\nTable 1.

There were no recipients who were lost to follow-up without HCC recurrence. The median \nfollow-up time was 36 (17\u201380) months. The median psoas muscle (PM) thickness was 13.1 (10.9\u201315.3)mm/m, \nand 72 (78%) patients showed sarcopenia. The continuous value of PM thickness was negatively associated with \nHCC recurrence risk with a marginal significance (coefficient=\u22120.089 [9% increase in recurrence risk per unit \ndecrease in PM thickness], hazard ratio (HR)=0.92 [0.83\u20131.01], p=0.071). Twenty-seven (29.3%) recipients \ndeveloped HCC recurrence: 26 of 72 (36.1%) sarcopenic recipients and one of 20 (5.0%) non-sarcopenic recipi\ufffeents (Fig.\u00a01). The results of univariable analysis indicated that sarcopenia was significantly associated with HCC \nrecurrence risk (HR=8.06 [1.06\u201316.70], p=0.044). The non-significance of continuous PM thickness and sig\ufffenificance of sarcopenia indicate that the clinical implications of PM thickness are not continuous, as shown in \nSupplementary Fig.\u00a0S1. Graft-to-recipient weight ratio, recipient gender, body mass index, alpha-fetoprotein \nlevel, tumor size, and microvascular invasion, in addition to sarcopenia, were significantly associated with HCC \nrecurrence (p<0.05, Table\u00a02). As shown in Table\u00a03, multivariable analysis confirmed the significantly higher \nrecurrence risk in patients with sarcopenia (HR=9.49 [1.18\u201376.32], p=0.034). Higher alpha-fetoprotein level \n(HR=1.20 [1.03\u20131.39], p=0.022) and microvascular invasion (HR=5.30 [1.83\u201315.37], p=0.002) were also \nidentified as independent risk factors. To further evaluate the relevance of the degree of sarcopenia, we graphi\ufffecally compared HCC recurrence risk of sarcopenic recipients with PM thickness of <12.0mm/m and sarcopenic \nrecipients with PM thickness of \u226512.0 mm/m, although statistical analysis could not be performed due to the \nlack of sufficient sample size. As shown in Fig.\u00a02, there was a trend toward a high recurrence risk in sarcopenic \nrecipients with lower PM thickness, particularly during the early period (2 years of transplantation), suggesting \nthat the degree of sarcopenia is relevant in addition to the presence of sarcopenia. As shown in Fig.\u00a03, there \nwas a consistent trend toward higher recurrence risk in recipients with sarcopenia than in recipients without \nsarcopenia irrespective of the presence of other independent risk factors, indicating that there was no interac\ufffetion effect of sarcopenia with alpha-fetoprotein or microvascular invasion on HCC recurrence and supporting \nthe independence of sarcopenia. Moreover, the degree of model fitness was significantly better when the model \nincludes sarcopenia in addition to alpha-fetoprotein and microvascular invasion than when the model only \ninclude alpha-fetoprotein and microvascular invasion (log-likelihood difference=4.6, p=0.032). As shown in \nFig.\u00a04A, time-dependent C-index was >0.80 in most follow-up period, indicating a strong discrimination abil\ufffeity, and it was graphically greater when the model includes sarcopenia although statistical difference cannot be \ncalculated due to the insufficient sample size. When considering only two preoperative variables (sarcopenia and \nalpha-fetoprotein), incorporation of sarcopenia with alpha-fetoprotein significantly increased the model fitness \n(log-likelihood difference=4.0, p=0.046). Time-dependent C-index was graphically greater when the model \nincorporated sarcopenia with alpha-fetoprotein (Fig.\u00a04B).\nAmong the 23 recipients who died, 16 died of HCC recurrence and 7 died from HCC-unrelated causes. As \nshown in Fig.\u00a05, there was a trend toward higher HCC-related death risk in sarcopenic patients (HR=3.89 [0.51\u2013\n29.49, p=0.154), whereas the risk of HCC-unrelated death was comparable irrespective of the presence of sarco\ufffepenia (HR=1.53 [0.19\u201312.76], p=0.689). This finding indicates that sarcopenia-related HCC recurrence is an \nimportant cause of death in patients undergoing liver transplantation for advanced HCC.\nDiscussion\nThis study demonstrated that sarcopenia was independently associated with tumor recurrence after LDLT in male \npatients with advanced HCC. The predominant cause of death in sarcopenic recipients was post-transplant HCC \nrecurrence. In addition, the current study suggested a possibility that there is a significant degree of heterogeneity \nin tumor recurrence risk even in advanced HCC exceeding the Milan criteria, which is in agreement with recent \nstudies suggesting the feasibility of using wider selection criteria for liver transplantation for advanced HCC2,9,10. \nThat is, post-transplant HCC recurrence risk can be predicted more precisely based on skeletal muscle mass and \nalpha-fetoprotein, which may help avoid unnecessary discarding of LDLT due to the concern of high recurrence \nrisk or help the more cautious selection of recipients who would stand to benefit from LDLT considering the \npotential donor risk1\n. Also, the better prediction may provide potential advantages to help physicians guide their \nperioperative clinical decision to adjust recurrence risk in terms of living donor selection, autologous transfu\ufffesion11, immunosuppression12, and the use of an adjuvant treatment such as sorafenib13.\nFigure 1. Cumulative recurrence probability according to the presence of sarcopenia. Curves are depicted until \n5 years after transplantation because there was no recurrence after 5 years.\n\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nSCientifiC REPOrTS | (2018) 8:7157 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-25628-w 4\nThe mechanism underlying the association between sarcopenia and HCC recurrence is unclear, but may \nbe explained by the tumor microenvironment (inflammation and immunity) and cytokine (myokines and adi\ufffepokines)14. HCC recurrence arises from cancer cells present in the circulation or in micrometastatic colonies \nat the moment of transplantation and those cells can complete the metastatic cascade and reinitiate growth to \nform metastases within a few weeks15. Moreover, the intraoperative and early post-transplant period is a time \nwindow vulnerable to metastasis because patients experience surgery-induced stress, inflammation, platelet acti\ufffevation, transfusion, and immunosuppression. Thus, the interaction between HCC cells and the microenviron\ufffement during this early period is important. As the largest endocrine organ in the body, skeletal muscle produces \nand releases various physiologically important cytokines and proteins (named myokines) that contribute to the \ntumor microenvironment16. Myokines counteract the harmful effects of proinflammatory adipokines; accord\ufffeingly, muscle waste tilts the balance to the proinflammatory pathways and results in systemic inflammation as \nwell as immune disturbance. For instance, muscle waste results in the increase in IL-6, an inflammatory cytokine \nwhich is thought to increase the risk of HCC developement14,17. On the other hand, muscle waste results in the \ndecrease in the production of IL-15, which plays an important role in inhibiting adipose tissue and reversing \nHR (95% CI) p\nGraft factor\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Donor age (years) 0.99 (0.95\u20131.03) 0.550\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Male donor 1.78 (0.70\u20134.56) 0.230\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Graft-to-recipient weight ratio < 1.0% 0.48 (0.22\u20131.07) 0.071\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Macrosteatosis \u2265 5% 0.89 (0.42\u20131.90) 0.770\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cold ischemia time (minutes) 0.99 (0.98\u20131.01) 0.320\nRecipient factors\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Age (years) 1.02 (0.95\u20131.09) 0.680\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Male \u2014 \u2014\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Body mass index (kg/m2\n) 0.84 (0.74\u20130.96) 0.010\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Diagnosed diabetes 1.09 (0.51\u20132.34) 0.820\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MELD score \u2265 20 0.87 (0.26\u20132.87) 0.820\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sodium level (mmol/L) 1.06 (0.98\u20131.14) 0.160\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hepatic encephalopathy\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0None\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Grade I-II (vs. none) 0.83 (0.25\u20132.75) 0.757\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Grade III\u2013IV 0 \u2014\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Refractory ascites 0.52 (0.16\u20131.65) 0.260\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pretransplant CRRT \u2014 \u2014\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pretransplant tumor treatment history 3.92 (0.90\u201317.01) 0.068\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0High sensitive C-reactive protein (mg/L) 1.06 (0.92\u20131.22) 0.419\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio 1.03 (0.90\u20131.17) 0.680\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarcopenia 8.06 (1.06\u201316.7) 0.044\nSurgical factors\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Operative time >10hours 0.57 (0.25\u20131.31) 0.190\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perioperative RBC transfusion > 6 units 0.52 (0.20\u20131.35) 0.180\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tacrolimus trough concentration >\n10ng/mL 2.14 (0.99\u20134.62) 0.054\nTumor biology\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0AFP (log-transformed ng/mL)* 1.30 (1.12\u20131.52) 0.001\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tumor number\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Solitary\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02\u20133 (vs. solitary) 0.89 (0.16\u20135.05) 0.890\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0>3 (vs. solitary) 1.55 (0.34\u20137.09) 0.570\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tumor size* 1.25 (1.14\u20131.37) <0.001\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Microvascular invasion 5.05 (1.80\u201314.19) 0.002\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bile duct invasion 2.34 (0.70\u20137.86) 0.168\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Edmonson grade III\u2013IV (vs. grade I\u2013II) 2.03 (0.56\u20137.29) 0.280\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Non-tumor liver cirrhosis 0.50 (0.19\u20131.34) 0.170\nTable 2.

Moreover, the increase \nin adipokines, such as leptin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a), and IL-6, reduces the survival of NK cells14,19. These \ninterrelations between myokines and adipokines may be related to the recurrence of HCC in sarcopenic patients \nbecause inflammation and escape from the host immune system are both important components for metastasis16. \nIn short, it can be deduced that preoperative sarcopenia that persists during the vulnerable early post-transplant \nperiod induces a more favorable microenvironment for metastasis of advanced HCC cells via increasing inflam\ufffemation and decreasing immunity and promotes tumor recurrence. Clinical evidence for the importance of body \ncomposition (sarcopenia, sarcopenic obesity, visceral obesity, or bone loss) on HCC recurrence after liver resec\ufffetion6\u20138\n or liver transplantation20,21 supports the findings of the current study.\nMultiple factors produce sarcopenia in patients with chronic liver disease, including loss of appetite, nutri\ufffeent malabsorption, hypermetabolism, poor hepatic glyconeogenic capacity, and complications such as chronic \nfatigue, portal hypertension, ascites, and encephalopathy3,22. The roles of potential mediators of the liver-muscle \naxis in cirrhosis, such as ammonia, testosterone, and growth hormone, are under investigation22. Cancer cachexia \nalso contributes to sarcopenia23, which in part explains the high incidence of sarcopenia in the current cohort \nof patients with advanced HCC. Based on the available evidence of contributors to sarcopenia, various strategies \nto increase skeletal muscle mass and improve outcomes in the non-transplant and post-transplant populations \nhave been evaluated. These strategies include supplemental nutrition, physical activity, treating refractory ascites, \nammonia reduction, and molecular targeted strategies such as myostatin antagonists and mitochondrial protec\ufffetive agents22.\nDespite the high prevalence of sarcopenia and its association with clinical outcomes in cirrhotic patients, \nit is not efficiently incorporated into the clinical practice. One main reason is the lack of readily available, \neasy-to-measure, and objective parameters representing skeletal muscle mass5\n. Conventional methods for skele\ufffetal muscle measurement include anthropometric measurements, laboratory parameters (e.g. albumin), bioelec\ufffetrical impedance, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Unfortunately, the \napplicability of these methods is limited in cirrhotic patients due to the characteristics of cirrhosis such as edema, \nhypoalbuminemia, and ascites3\n. However, recent studies have shown that computed tomography (CT) objectively \nmeasures skeletal muscle mass and predicts the prognosis in cirrhotic patients4,5,24. In particular, a recent study \ndemonstrated that CT can be used as a reliable tool to measure PM thickness and diagnose sarcopenia even in \nascitic patients and the authors explained that its reliability is attributed to the anatomical distinction between \nascites and the PM, which is surrounded by retroperitoneal fat tissue and vertebra and is not affected by ascites25. \nOf note, PM thickness, which has been validated in the current and recent studies24,25, can be easily measured in \na picture archiving and communication system without specific software, allowing it to be more applicable as a \ndaily clinical practice.\nCoefficient HR (95% CI) p\nSarcopenia 2.25 9.49 (1.18\u201376.32) 0.034\nAlpha-fetoprotein (log\ufffetransformed ng/mL) 0.18 1.20 (1.03\u20131.39) 0.022\nMicrovascular invasion 1.67 5.30 (1.83\u201315.37) 0.002\nTable 3. Multivariable analysis. Variables with p<0.05 during univariable analysis were included in the model \nand backward stepwise selection was used for generating the final model. Sarcopenia was defined based on \ntransverse psoas muscle thickness.\nFigure 2. Cumulative recurrence probability of sarcopenic recipients stratified dichotomously into two groups.\n\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nSCientifiC REPOrTS | (2018) 8:7157 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-25628-w 6\nThe recurrence probability at 5 years after transplantation was 35.9% (21.6%\u201350.4%) in our cohort. As demon\ufffestrated in the current and previous studies, the probability of HCC recurrence after liver transplantation for HCC \nbeyond the Milan criteria may vary by cohort according to the respective proportion of high risk and low risk \nrecipients. A previous study stratified a validation cohort of 100 patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria into \nhigh (n=35) and low (n=65) risk of HCC recurrence according to the alpha-fetoprotein model10. The recur\uffference probability at 5 years post-transplantation was 7.7%\u201314.4% in the low risk group and 46.3%\u201347.6% in the \nhigh risk group, respectively. Our cohort consisted of 44 low risk recipients and 48 high risk recipients according \nto the alpha-fetoprotein model and our recurrence probability is in agreement with the calculated probability \nbased on the alpha-fetoprotein model.\nOur study model has several advantages in terms of data quality. First, this study included a homogeneous \nLDLT population. All recipients received right hemi-liver graft without variations through a single transplant \nteam. All recipients underwent an elective surgery without emergent conditions or acute deterioration. Only \n4 patients had a MELD score >30. Accordingly, thorough perioperative anesthetic and surgical care could be \nperformed in an unhurried fashion strictly based on the standardized institutional protocols. Second, recur\uffference evaluation was rigorously performed and there were no follow-up losses; thus, the data regarding the \ntime-to-recurrence and time-to-death were highly reliable. Third, biasing effects from HCC-unrelated death was \nanother concern because HCC-unrelated death excludes patients from the risk set and changes the recurrence \nprobability. Moreover, our previous research demonstrated that the impact of a clinical variable on HCC-related \ndeath versus HCC-unrelated death can be different26,27. Thus, the Fine and Gray model was used by account\ufffeing for the competing risk of HCC-unrelated death instead of the standard Cox model. This issue was relevant \nbecause sarcopenia could also negatively influence the post-transplant outcomes of non-HCC patients and could \nconfound the effects on HCC recurrence28\u201330. Fourth, even though the number of recurrences is apparently small, \nthe power of this study to compare the hazard ratios between the sarcopenic group and non-sarcopenic group is \n>90% under the significance level of 5%. The power was calculated after adjustment with variance inflation factor \n(1/0.95) between sarcopenia and two variables (alpha-fetoprotein and microvascular invasion) for the multivar\ufffeiable model expecting the HR 9.4931.\nThis study has several limitations. First, due to its retrospective nature, a direct cause and effect relationship \nbetween sarcopenia and HCC recurrence remains unknown. In particular, sarcopenia is a component part of \ncancer cachexia23; thus, it is unclear whether sarcopenia directly impacts the metastasis of HCC cells or if sarco\ufffepenia is an epiphenomenon. In this regard, the effects of anti-sarcopenia treatment on HCC recurrence are also \nunclear and warrant future research. Second, as the first to evaluate the relationship between sarcopenia and \npost-transplant recurrence of HCC beyond the Milan criteria, this study set the cutoff PM thickness at 15.5mm/m \nbased on optimal stratification within our data because there are no reference values. Additional research is \nwarranted to validate the PM thickness applicable in clinical practice. In particular, the cutoff values might \nFigure 3. Cumulative recurrence probability according to the presence of sarcopenia in subgroups stratified by \n(A) alpha-fetoprotein level and (B) tumor microvascular invasion.\n\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nSCientifiC REPOrTS | (2018) 8:7157 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-25628-w 7\ndiffer by ethnicity: a previous study of patients listed for transplantation in France set the cutoff at 16.8mm/m24; \nin contrast, another study of ascitic patients in South Korea set the cutoff at 14.0 mm/m25. Sex also affects the \namount of skeletal muscle mass29; thus, the cutoff value in the current study cannot be translated to female recip\ufffeients. Third, some tumor cells remain dormant for a long period at the secondary site and initiate growth later15. \nIn this setting, metastasis occurs over an extended period of time. Thus, post-transplant long-term change in PM \nthickness may influence HCC recurrence32.\nIn summary, the risk of tumor recurrence after LDLT for treating HCC beyond the Milan criteria was signifi\ufffecantly higher in patients with psoas muscle wasting. Despite the methodological limitation, our findings suggest \nthat sarcopenia is an important prognostic factor for post-transplant tumor recurrence of advanced HCC.\nFigure 4. C-index of the prediction model for hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence.

We screened the records of 140 male recipients who underwent a first adult-to-adult LDLT between \nMay 2002 and May 2014 in our hospital (200th and 1500th LT cases) and were pathologically diagnosed as HCC \nbeyond the Milan criteria without macrovascular invasion. None of the donor livers were procured from prison\ufffeers. We only included male recipients because reference values for PM thickness can differ by sex4\n. We excluded \n3 recipients who underwent cyclosporine-based immunosuppression due to possible tacrolimus toxicity and 2 \nrecipients due to missing data. Among the remaining 135 recipients, only those with utilizable cross-section \nPM images at the third lumbar vertebra (L3) with CT within 2 months before surgery were included because a \n2-month duration is considered enough for muscle composition to be changed4,7,33. Accordingly, we excluded 15 \nrecipients in whom the lowest CT image did not reach the L3 level, 20 recipients who had only outside CT images, \nand 8 recipients who underwent CT earlier than 2 months before surgery. The results of the comparison between \nthe 92 recipients with an available CT image and 43 recipients without an available CT image are described in \nSupplementary Table\u00a0S2, implying a low risk of selection bias from the exclusion of 43 recipients.\nData collection. Data were obtained from computerized medical records and a liver transplantation database \n(prospectively collected). Recipients were followed until the end of the study in March 2015. Histology results of \nthe removed liver were obtained from the postoperative pathology report. No patients received radiation or adju\ufffevant chemotherapy for tumor prophylaxis after transplantation. The recurrence of HCC was defined on the basis \nof radiological evidence. Recipients were monitored regularly by measurement of serum alpha-fetoprotein level \nevery 1\u20132 months, and chest radiography and abdominal ultrasonography or CT was used every 3 to 6 months \nto check for evidence of recurrence. When tumor recurrence was suspected, CT, magnetic resonance imaging, \nbone scan, or positron emission tomography scan was used to detect intrahepatic/extrahepatic metastasis. The \nInstitutional Review Board of Samsung Medical Center approved this study (SMC 2015-05-002-001) and waived \nFigure 5. Survival probability according to the presence of sarcopenia.

All procedures applied to this study were performed in accordance \nwith the relevant guidelines and regulations.\nMuscle mass quantification. PM thickness, the largest diameter perpendicular to the longest antero\ufffeposterior axis of the PM including both the psoas major and psoas minor (Fig.\u00a06), was used as a surrogate marker \nof PM mass based on recent studies demonstrating the importance of PM thickness on clinical outcomes in \ncirrhotic patients24,25. PM thickness was measured on the right PM of a single axial CT image at the level of the \nL3 transverse process based on previous studies demonstrating that PM mass measured by CT at the L3 level \ncorresponds to whole abdominal skeletal muscle mass and whole body skeletal muscle mass4,33. PM thickness was \nnormalized to stature by dividing with height (mm/m)4,24. A single investigator (Y.L.K.) uniformly evaluated all \nCT images on a picture archiving and communication system (PathSpeed, GE Healthcare, Chicago).\nLiver transplant indication. Acceptance criteria for liver donation were age \u226465 years, body mass index \n<35 kg/m, macrosteatosis \u226430%, and residual liver volume \u226530%. LT for HCC diagnosed to exceed the Milan \ncriteria during preoperative evaluations was performed upon the patient\u2019s and donor\u2019s request after thorough \nexplanation of the higher recurrence probability26. Extrahepatic metastasis or macrovascular invasion detected in \npreoperative imaging evaluations was a contraindication for transplantation.\nSurgical and anesthetic managements. Surgical and anesthetic management for donors34 and recipi\ufffeents35 was performed based on standardized institutional protocols, as described previously. In short, all grafts \nconsisted of segment 5\u20138 excluding the middle hepatic vein trunk. Graft implantation was performed using \nthe piggyback technique. Blood transfusion was strictly controlled by means of the restrictive and prophylactic \ntransfusion strategy35. A blood salvage procedure was routinely used despite the presence of HCC for reducing \nthe requirement for allogeneic red blood cell transfusion and its fatal complications11. Immunosuppression was \nperformed using the quadruple regimen as described previously26. Induction consisted of bolus steroid injec\ufffetion, which was tapered by the third month, and basilliximab. Tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil were used \nas maintenance therapy. Tacrolimus treatment was initiated on postoperative day 3, and the blood level was \nadjusted to maintain a daily measured trough plasma concentration of 10ng/mL during the first month, which \nwas reduced to 5\u20138ng/mL thereafter.\nVariables and statistical analysis. The primary outcome was overall (intrahepatic or extrahepatic) HCC \nrecurrence after transplantation. Post-transplant death was considered the competing risk event and survival \nanalysis was performed using the Fine and Gray model36. The cutoff PM thickness for categorizing patients as \nhigh and low risk of HCC recurrence was set at 15.5mm/m based on optimal stratification by means of the Gray\u2019s \ntest statistic (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S1)27. The cutoff values for mean trough tacrolimus concentration during the \nfirst month after transplantation were set at 10ng/mL12. Variables with p<0.05 during univariable analysis were \nincluded in multivariable analysis and backward stepwise selection was used for generating the final multivariable \nmodel37. Multicollinearity was tested by means of the variance inflation factor. Interaction effect between sarco\ufffepenia and other contributors for HCC recurrence were graphically tested by means of subgroup analysis while \nthe cutoff value for alpha-fetoprotein was set at 100 ng/mL10. The benefit of incorporating sarcopenia into the \nprediction model was statistically tested using the likelihood test and graphically tested using the time-dependent \nreceiver operating characteristic curve. Continuous variables are summarized as median (25th percentile, 75th \npercentile), and categorical variables are presented as frequency (%). All reported P values were two-sided and \np<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed using SPSS 20.0 (IBM Corp., Chicago, \nIL), R 3.0.2 (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria; http://www.R-project.org/), or SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, \nCary, NC).\nFigure 6.

            "response": "This scientific article, published in Scientific Reports, investigates the correlation between sarcopenia and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after liver transplantation, focusing on patients with advanced HCC. The study involved 278 patients who underwent liver transplantation for HCC between January 2004 and December 2016 at a single center in South Korea. The researchers measured psoas muscle area (PMA) using computed tomography scans before transplantation and assessed sarcopenia based on PMA cutoff points. They found that sarcopenia was significantly associated with higher recurrence risk of HCC after liver transplantation, regardless of whether the 5th or 1st quartiles of PMA were used as cutoff points. The study suggests that sarcopenia may serve as an independent predictor for HCC recurrence after liver transplantation, and its prevalence has increased since the introduction of the 65-year-old criterion for liver transplantation for HCC. The authors suggest that evaluating sarcopenia before liver transplantation may aid in identifying high-risk patients and developing personalized management strategies. The study highlights the importance of addressing sarcopenia in the context of liver transplantation for HCC.\n\nCompeting interests: The authors declared no competing interests.\n\nOpen access: This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which allows for unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as proper attribution is given to the original author(s) and the source.
