Radiologists again at\nthe forefront of innovation in medicine\nFilippo Pesapane1†\n, Marina Codari2*† and Francesco Sardanelli2,3\nAbstract\nOne of the most promising areas of health innovation is the application of artificial intelligence (AI), primarily in medical\nimaging. This article provides basic definitions of terms such as “machine/deep learning” and analyses the integration\nof AI into radiology. Publications on AI have drastically increased from about 100–150 per year in 2007–2008\nto 700–800 per year in 2016–2017. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography collectively account for\nmore than 50% of current articles. Neuroradiology appears in about one-third of the papers, followed by musculoskeletal,\ncardiovascular, breast, urogenital, lung/thorax, and abdomen, each representing 6–9% of articles. With an irreversible\nincrease in the amount of data and the possibility to use AI to identify findings either detectable or not by the human\neye, radiology is now moving from a subjective perceptual skill to a more objective science. Radiologists, who were on\nthe forefront of the digital era in medicine, can guide the introduction of AI into healthcare. Yet, they will not be replaced\nbecause radiology includes communication of diagnosis, consideration of patient’s values and preferences, medical\njudgment, quality assurance, education, policy-making, and interventional procedures. The higher efficiency provided\nby AI will allow radiologists to perform more value-added tasks, becoming more visible to patients and playing a vital\nrole in multidisciplinary clinical teams.\nKeywords: Neural networks (computer), Artificial intelligence, Deep learning, Machine learning, Radiology\nKey points\n\u0001 Over 10 years, publications on AI in radiology have\nincreased from 100–150 per year to 700–800 per\nyear\n\u0001 Magnetic resonance imaging and computed\ntomography are the most involved techniques\n\u0001 Neuroradiology appears as the most involved\nsubspecialty (accounting for about one-third of the\npapers), followed by musculoskeletal, cardiovascular,\nbreast, urogenital, lung/thorax, and abdominal\nradiology (each representing 6–9% of articles)\n\u0001 Radiologists, the physicians who were on the\nforefront of the digital era in medicine, can now\nguide the introduction of AI in healthcare\nIntroduction\nOne of the most promising areas of health innovation is\nthe application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical im￾aging, including, but not limited to, image processing and\ninterpretation [1]. Indeed, AI may find multiple applica￾tions, from image acquisition and processing to aided\nreporting, follow-up planning, data storage, data mining,\nand many others. Due to this wide range of applications, AI\nis expected to massively impact the radiologist’s daily life.\nThis article provides basic definitions of terms com￾monly used when discussing AI applications, analyses\nvarious aspects related to the integration of AI in the\nradiological workflow, and provides an overview of the\nbalance between AI threats and opportunities for radiol￾ogists.

At the same \ntime, computational analysis of very large datasets is now \nrelatively straightforward, so that an enormous number of \ntests can be run in a short time on the same dataset. These \ndramatic advances in the flexibility of research design and \nanalysis have occurred without accompanying changes to \nother aspects of research design, particularly power. For \nexample, the average sample size has not changed sub￾stantially over time88 despite the fact that neuroscientists \nare likely to be pursuing smaller effects. The increase in \nresearch flexibility and the complexity of study designs89\ncombined with the stability of sample size and search for \nincreasingly subtle effects has a disquieting consequence: \na dramatic increase in the likelihood that statistically sig￾nificant findings are spurious. This may be at the root of \nthe recent replication failures in the preclinical literature8\nand the correspondingly poor translation of these findings \ninto humans90.\nLow power is a problem in practice because of the \nnormative publishing standards for producing novel, \nsignificant, clean results and the ubiquity of null \nhypothesis significance testing as the means of evaluat￾ing the truth of research findings. As we have shown, \nthese factors result in biases that are exacerbated by low \npower. Ultimately, these biases reduce the reproducibil￾ity of neuroscience findings and negatively affect the \nvalidity of the accumulated findings. Unfortunately, \npublishing and reporting practices are unlikely to \nchange rapidly. Nonetheless, existing scientific practices \ncan be improved with small changes or additions that \napproximate key features of the idealized model4,91,92. \nWe provide a summary of recommendations for future \nresearch practice in BOX 2.\nIncreasing disclosure.

Therein how to control the\nspreading process is of particular interests [5], where the\nidentification of influential nodes is a crucial issue according to\nthe assumption that highly influential nodes are more likely to be\ninfected and to infect a larger number of nodes [6–8].\nA number of centrality indices have been proposed to address\nthis problem, such as degree centrality, closeness centrality [9],\nbetweenness centrality [10], and eigenvector centrality [11].\nDegree centrality is a straightforward and efficient metric but less\nrelevant. Recent researches show that top-degree ranking nodes\nhave positive effects on cooperative behaviors in social networks\n[12,13]. However, the location of a node in the network may play\na more important role than its degree. For example, a node\nlocated in the center of the network, having a few highly influential\nneighbors, may be more influential than a node having a larger\nnumber of less influential neighbors. Considering this fact, Kitsak\net al. [6] proposed a coarse-grained method by using k-core\ndecomposition to quantify a node’s influence based on the\nassumption that nodes in the same shell have similar influence\nand nodes in higher-level shells are likely to infect more nodes.\nThis method may fail in some cases. For example, in a tree, all\nnodes are in 1-core and thus expected to have the same influence\naccording to [6]. However, this tree may be hierarchically\norganized (e.g., the binary tree) and nodes near the root have\nmuch higher influence than leaves. Chen et al. [14] devised a semi￾local index by considering the next nearest neighborhood, which\ncan well identify influential nodes in a hierarchical tree and give\nmore elaborate division than k-core decomposition. Experimental\nresults demonstrated that the semi-local index performs as good as\nglobal indices while has much lower computational complexity,\nand thus it obtains a good trade-off on effectiveness and efficiency.\nRecently, Chen et al. [15] considered the effect of path number\nand path diversity while ranking the spreading ability of nodes in\nnetworks and introduced two correction factors correspondingly.\nThe ranking accuracy is considerably increased compared with\nsome well-known ranking methods, such as PageRank and\nLeaderRank.\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e77455", "Publication bias was assessed with funnel plots and Egger’s test.\nBoth random-effect and fixed-effect models were used to pool the\ndata, and the two models yielded mainly identical results in our\nanalysis. The results were presented from the random-effect\nmodel. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata software\n(Stata version 11, College Station, Texas).\nResults\nWe identified 769 full-text articles via database searches and 4\nabstracts via manual internet searches through September 30th,\n2012. Of these studies, 233 were from PubMed, 528 from\nEmbase.com, and 8 from Ovid platform. After auto screening was\nperformed using the Endnote program, 260 duplicate articles were\nremoved, and 509 full-text articles were identified by manual\nscreening. Of the 4 abstracts selected, 2 were excluded for lack of\nrelevant data, and the remaining 2 were specific for trials that were\nreported in full-text articles. To obtain as much accurate\ninformation as possible, we contacted five corresponding authors\nregarding the incomplete or vague data available in their\npublished works. Four of these authors kindly replied, but only\none provided additional information that we needed. Three full￾text articles were identified from the databases we listed above but\ndownloaded from Google Scholar. Ultimately, 18 published\nstudies [6,11–27] fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Figure 1 shows\nthe study flow regarding trial selection and reasons for exclusion.\nTrial characteristics\nA total 1836 patients between the ages of 18,93 years, with\nCKD at stage 3,5, GFR values ranging from 6,60 ml/min/\n1.73 m2 and no apparent need for dialysis or kidney transplan￾tation at baseline, were included. The treatment duration ranged\nfrom 1 to 24 months (median: 6 months). Six of these trials\nexplored the effect of vitamin D on proteinuria, twelve evaluated\nchanges in renal function, and fifteen discussed the incidence of\nhypercalcemia in treated subjects as compared to controls. Two\nother studies compared the effects of newer versus more\nestablished vitamin D compounds in non-dialysis patients\n(Table 2).\nStudy quality\nMost trials in our analysis were of moderate quality. Random\nsequence generation was clearly stated in 10 of 18 trials (56%).\nAllocation concealment was adequate in 5 of 18 trials (28%).\nBlinding of participants and personnel occurred in 12 of 18 trials\n(67%). Blinding of the outcome assessment was reported in 12 of\n18 trials (67%). By contrast, outcome data were provided\nincompletely in 4 of 18 trials (22%), and selective reporting was\nfound in 3 of 18 trials (17%). The likelihood of additional sources\nof bias was as high as 33% for 6 trials, and these related to\ndeclarations of interests or conflicts relating to the commercial\nsource of the funding.\nOutcome measurement\nProteinuria: Six RCTs (685 patients) compared the effects of\nvitamin D versus the use of placebo or no medication. Four of\nthese studies evaluated a newer vitamin D analogue, and the other\ntwo evaluated an established vitamin D compound. The pooled\ndata indicated that vitamin D reduced proteinuria in non-dialysis\npatients (RR, 2.00; 95%CI, 1.42 to 2.81).

Radiologists again at\nthe forefront of innovation in medicine\nFilippo Pesapane1†\n, Marina Codari2*† and Francesco Sardanelli2,3\nAbstract\nOne of the most promising areas of health innovation is the application of artificial intelligence (AI), primarily in medical\nimaging. This article provides basic definitions of terms such as “machine/deep learning” and analyses the integration\nof AI into radiology. Publications on AI have drastically increased from about 100–150 per year in 2007–2008\nto 700–800 per year in 2016–2017. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography collectively account for\nmore than 50% of current articles. Neuroradiology appears in about one-third of the papers, followed by musculoskeletal,\ncardiovascular, breast, urogenital, lung/thorax, and abdomen, each representing 6–9% of articles. With an irreversible\nincrease in the amount of data and the possibility to use AI to identify findings either detectable or not by the human\neye, radiology is now moving from a subjective perceptual skill to a more objective science. Radiologists, who were on\nthe forefront of the digital era in medicine, can guide the introduction of AI into healthcare. Yet, they will not be replaced\nbecause radiology includes communication of diagnosis, consideration of patient’s values and preferences, medical\njudgment, quality assurance, education, policy-making, and interventional procedures. The higher efficiency provided\nby AI will allow radiologists to perform more value-added tasks, becoming more visible to patients and playing a vital\nrole in multidisciplinary clinical teams.\nKeywords: Neural networks (computer), Artificial intelligence, Deep learning, Machine learning, Radiology\nKey points\n\u0001 Over 10 years, publications on AI in radiology have\nincreased from 100–150 per year to 700–800 per\nyear\n\u0001 Magnetic resonance imaging and computed\ntomography are the most involved techniques\n\u0001 Neuroradiology appears as the most involved\nsubspecialty (accounting for about one-third of the\npapers), followed by musculoskeletal, cardiovascular,\nbreast, urogenital, lung/thorax, and abdominal\nradiology (each representing 6–9% of articles)\n\u0001 Radiologists, the physicians who were on the\nforefront of the digital era in medicine, can now\nguide the introduction of AI in healthcare\nIntroduction\nOne of the most promising areas of health innovation is\nthe application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical im￾aging, including, but not limited to, image processing and\ninterpretation [1]. Indeed, AI may find multiple applica￾tions, from image acquisition and processing to aided\nreporting, follow-up planning, data storage, data mining,\nand many others. Due to this wide range of applications, AI\nis expected to massively impact the radiologist’s daily life.\nThis article provides basic definitions of terms com￾monly used when discussing AI applications, analyses\nvarious aspects related to the integration of AI in the\nradiological workflow, and provides an overview of the\nbalance between AI threats and opportunities for radiol￾ogists. Awareness of this trend is a necessity, especially\nfor younger generations who will face this revolution.\nArtificial intelligence: definitions\nThe term AI is applied when a device mimics cognitive\nfunctions, such as learning and problem solving [2].\n* Correspondence: marina.codari@grupposandonato.it †\nFilippo Pesapane and Marina Codari contributed equally to this work.\n2\nUnit of Radiology, IRCCS Policlinico San Donato, Via Morandi 30, 20097 San\nDonato Milanese, Milan, Italy\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nEuropean Radiology\nExperimental\n© The Author(s). 2018 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and\nreproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to\nthe Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.\nPesapane et al. European Radiology Experimental (2018) 2:35 \nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/s41747-018-0061-6\n\nMore generally, AI refers to a field of computer science\ndedicated to the creation of systems performing tasks\nthat usually require human intelligence, branching off\ninto different techniques [3]. Machine learning (ML), a\nterm introduced by Arthur Samuel in 1959 to describe a\nsubfield of AI [4] that includes all those approaches that\nallow computers to learn from data without being expli￾citly programmed, has been extensively applied to med￾ical imaging [5]. Among the techniques that fall under\nthe ML umbrella, deep learning (DL) has emerged as\none of the most promising. Indeed, DL is a technique\nbelonging to ML, which in turn refers to a broader AI\nfamily (Fig. 1). In particular, DL methods belong to\nrepresentation-learning methods with multiple levels of\nrepresentation, which process raw data to perform clas￾sification or detection tasks [6].\nML incorporates computational models and algorithms\nthat imitate the architecture of the biological neural net￾works in the brain, i.e., artificial neural networks (ANNs)\n[7]. Neural network architecture is structured in layers\ncomposed of interconnected nodes. Each node of the net￾work performs a weighted sum of the input data that are\nsubsequently passed to an activation function. Weights\nare dynamically optimised during the training phase.\nThere are three different kinds of layers: the input layer,\nwhich receives input data; the output layer, which pro￾duces the results of data processing; and the hidden\nlayer(s), which extracts the patterns within the data. The\nDL approach was developed to improve on the perform￾ance of conventional ANN when using deep architectures.\nA deep ANN differs from the single hidden layer by hav￾ing a large number of hidden layers, which characterise\nthe depth of the network [8]. Among the different deep\nANNs, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have\nbecome popular in computer vision applications. In this\nclass of deep ANNs, convolution operations are used to\nobtain feature maps in which the intensities of each pixel/\nvoxel are calculated as the sum of each pixel/voxel of the\noriginal image and its neighbours, weighted by convolu￾tion matrices (also called kernels). Different kernels are ap￾plied for specific tasks, such as blurring, sharpening, or\nedge detection. CNNs are biologically inspired networks\nmimicking the behaviour of the brain cortex, which con￾tains a complex structure of cells sensitive to small regions\nof the visual field [3]. The architecture of deep CNNs al￾lows for the composition of complex features (such as\nshapes) from simpler features (e.g. image intensities) to\ndecode image raw data without the need to detect specific\nfeatures [3] (Fig. 2).\nDespite their performance, ML network architecture\nmakes them more prone to fail in reaching the conver￾gence and overfit training dataset. On the other hand,\nthe complexity of deep network architectures makes\nthem demanding in terms of computational resources\nand dimension of the training sample.\nSuccess in DL application was possible mainly due to\nrecent advancements in the development of hardware\ntechnologies, like graphics processing units [5]. Indeed,\nthe high number of nodes needed to detect complex re￾lationships and patterns within data may result in bil￾lions of parameters that need to be optimised during the\ntraining phase. For this reason, DL networks require a\nhuge amount of training data, which in turn increase the\ncomputing power needed to analyse them. These are\nalso the reasons why DL algorithms are showing in￾creased performance and are, theoretically, not suscep￾tible to the performance plateau of the simpler ML\nnetworks (Fig. 3).\nFig. 1 Deep learning as a subset of machine learning methods, which represent a branch of the existing artificial intelligence techniques. Machine\nlearning techniques have been extensively applied since the 1980s. Deep learning has been applied since the 2010s due to the advancement of\ncomputational resources\nPesapane et al. European Radiology Experimental (2018) 2:35 Page 2 of 10\n\nRadiologists are already familiar with computer-aided\ndetection/diagnosis (CAD) systems, which were first in￾troduced in the 1960s in chest x-ray and mammography\napplications [5]. However, advances in algorithm devel￾opment, combined with the ease of access to computa￾tional resources, allows AI to be applied in radiological\ndecision-making at a higher functional level [7].\nThe wind of change\nThe great enthusiasm for and dynamism in the develop￾ment of AI systems in radiology is shown by the increase\nin publications on this topic (Figs. 4 and 5). Only 10\nyears ago, the total number of publications on AI in\nradiology only just exceeded 100 per year. Thereafter, we\nhad a tremendous increase, with over 700–800\npublications per year in 2016–17. In the last couple of\nyears, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic reson￾ance imaging (MRI) have collectively accounted for more\nthan 50% of articles, though radiography, mammography,\nand ultrasound are also represented (Table 1). Neuroradi￾ology (here evaluated as imaging of the central nervous\nsystem) is the most involved subspecialty (accounting for\nabout one-third of the papers), followed by musculoskel￾etal, cardiovascular, breast, urogenital, lung/thorax, and\nabdominal radiology, each representing between 6 and 9%\nof the total number of papers (Table 2). AI currently has\nan impact on the field of radiology, with MRI and neuro￾radiology as the major fields of innovation.\nRecent meetings have also proven the interest in AI\napplications. During the 2018 European Congress of\nRadiology and the 2017 Annual Meeting of the Radio￾logical Society of North America, AI represented the\nfocus of many talks. Studies showed the application of\nDL algorithms for assessing the risk of malignancy for a\nlung nodule, estimating skeletal maturity from paediatric\nhand radiographs, classifying liver masses, and even ob￾viating the need for thyroid and breast biopsies [9–11];\nat the same time, the vendors showed examples of AI\napplications in action [9, 10].\nAI in radiology: threat or opportunity?\nA motto of radiology residents is: “The more images you\nsee, the more examinations you report, the better you\nget”. The same principle works for ML, and in particular\nfor DL. In the past decades, medical imaging has evolved\nfrom projection images, such as radiographs or planar\nscintigrams, to tomographic (i.e. cross-sectional) images,\nsuch as ultrasound (US), CT, tomosynthesis, positron\nFig. 2 Comparison between classic machine learning and deep learning approaches applied to a classification task. Both depicted approaches\nuse an artificial neural network organised in different layers (IL input layer, HL hidden layer, OL output layer). The deep learning approach avoids\nthe design of dedicated feature extractors by using a deep neural network that represents complex features as a composition of simpler ones\nFig. 3 Graphical representation of the different relationship between\nthe amount of data given to traditional ML or DL systems and their\nperformance. Only DL systems continue to increase their performance\nPesapane et al. European Radiology Experimental (2018) 2:35 Page 3 of 10\n\nemission tomography, MRI, etc., becoming more\ncomplex and data rich. Even though this shift to\nthree-dimensional (3D) imaging began during the 1930s,\nit was not until the digital era that this approach allowed\nhigh anatomic detail to be obtained and functional infor￾mation to be captured.\nThe increasing amount of data to be processed can in￾fluence how radiologists interpret images: from inference\nto merely detection and description. When too much time\nis taken for image analysis, the time for evaluating clinical\nand laboratory contexts is squeezed [12]. The radiologist\nis reduced to being only an image analyst. The clinical in￾terpretation of the findings is left to other physicians. This\nis dangerous, not only for radiologists but also for patients:\nnon-radiologists can have a full understanding of the clin￾ical situation but do not have the radiological knowledge.\nIn other words, if radiologists do not have the time for\nclinical judgement, the final meaning of radiological exam￾inations will be left to non-experts in medical imaging.\nIn this scenario, AI is not a threat to radiology. It is in￾deed a tremendous opportunity for its improvement. In\nfact, similar to our natural intelligence, AI algorithms\nlook at medical images to identify patterns after being\ntrained using vast numbers of examinations and images.\nThose systems will be able to give information about the\ncharacterisation of abnormal findings, mostly in terms of\nconditional probabilities to be applied to Bayesian\ndecision-making [13, 14].\nFig. 4 Number of publications indexed on EMBASE obtained using the search query (‘artificial intelligence’/exp.

European Radiology Experimental (2018) 2:35 Page 4 of 10\n\nThis is crucial because not all abnormalities are repre￾sentative of disease and must be actioned. AI systems\nlearn on a case-by-case basis. However, unlike CAD sys￾tems, which just highlight the presence or absence of\nimage features known to be associated with a disease state\n[15, 16], AI systems look at specific labelled structures and\nalso learn how to extract image features either visible or\ninvisible to the human eye. This approach mimics human\nanalytical cognition, allowing for better performance than\nthat obtained with old CAD software [17].\nWith the irreversible increase in imaging data and the\npossibility to identify findings that humans can or can￾not detect [18], radiology is now moving from a subject￾ive perceptual skill to a more objective science [12]. In\nfact, the radiologist’s work is currently limited by sub￾jectivity, i.e. variations across interpreters, and the\nadverse effect of fatigue. The attention to inter- and\nintra-reader variability [19] and the work committed to\nimprove the repeatability and reproducibility of medical\nimaging over the past decades proves the need for repro￾ducible radiological results. In a broader perspective, the\ntrend toward data sharing also works in this case [20].\nThe key point is that AI has the potential to replace\nmany of the routine detection, characterisation and\nquantification tasks currently performed by radiologists\nusing cognitive ability, as well as to accomplish the inte￾gration of data mining of electronic medical records in\nthe process [1, 7, 21].\nMoreover, the recently developed DL networks have led\nto more robust models for radiomics, which is an emerging\nfield that deals with the high-throughput extraction of\nquantitative peculiar features from radiological images\n[22–26]. Indeed, data derived from radiomics investigation,\nsuch as intensity, shape, texture, wavelength, etc., can be\nextracted from medical images [23, 27–31] and extracted\nby or integrated in ML approaches, providing valuable\ninformation for the prediction of treatment response, differ￾entiating benign and malignant tumours, and assessing\ncancer genetics in many cancer types [23, 32–34]. Because\nof the rapid growth of this area, numerous published radio￾mics investigations lack standardised evaluation of both the\nscientific integrity and the clinical relevance [22]. However,\ndespite the ongoing need for independent validation data￾sets to confirm the diagnostic and prognostic value of\nradiomics features, radiomics has shown several promising\napplications for personalised therapy [22, 23], not only in\noncology but also in other fields, as shown by recent\noriginal articles that have proved the value of radiomics in\nthe cardiovascular CT domain [35, 36].\nFinally, AI applications may enhance the reproducibil￾ity of technical protocols, improving image quality and\ndecreasing radiation dose, decreasing MRI scanner time\n[39] and optimising staffing and CT/MRI scanner util￾isation, thereby reducing costs [1]. These applications\nwill simplify and accelerate technicians’ work, also\nresulting in an average higher technical quality of exami￾nations. This may counteract one of the current limita￾tions of AI systems, i.e. the low ability to recognise the\neffects of positioning, motion artefacts, etc., also due to\nthe lack of standardised acquisition protocols [15, 33,\n34]. In other words, AI needs high-quality studies, but\nits application will lead towards better quality. The holy\ngrail of standardisation in radiology may become attain￾able, also increasing productivity.\nThe quicker and standardised detection of image\nfindings has the potential to shorten reporting time\nand to create automated sections of reports [2]. Struc￾tured AI-aided reporting represents a domain where\nAI may have a great impact, helping radiologists use\nrelevant data for diagnosis and presenting it in a con￾cise format [40].\nRecently, the radiological community has discussed\nhow such changes will alter the professional status of ra￾diologists. Negative feelings were expressed, reflecting\nthe opinions of those who are thinking that medicine\nwill not need radiologists at all [21, 41, 42]. Should we\nconsider closing postgraduate schools of radiology, as\nsomeone suggested [12, 21]? No. Healthcare systems\nTable 2 Number of articles indexed on EMBASE stratified by\nradiology subspecialty/body part\nBody parts 2015 2016 2017\nCentral nervous system 163 235 211\n38% 43% 34%\nBone, spine and joints 29 37 54\n7% 7% 9%\nCardiovascular 24 32 49\n6% 6% 8%\nBreast 41 39 50\n10% 7% 8%\nUrogenital 40 25 52\n9% 5% 8%\nThorax and lungs 36 21 46\n8% 4% 7%\nAbdomen 28 27 36\n6% 5% 6%\nOther 70 135 130\n16% 25% 21%\nTotal 431 551 628\n100% 100% 100%\nSearch query: (‘artificial intelligence’/exp.

This answer is not based on a prejudi￾cial defence of radiology as a discipline and profession.\nTwo main ideas should guide this prediction: first, “The\nbest qualification of a prophet is to have a good memory”\n(attributed to Marquis of Halifax) [43]; and second, “One\nway to predict the future is to create it” (attributed to\nAbraham Lincoln) [44].\nRadiologists were on the forefront of the digital era in\nmedicine. They guided the process, being the first med￾ical professionals to adopt computer science, and are\nnow probably the most digitally informed healthcare\nprofessionals [45]. Although the introduction of new\ntechnologies was mostly perceived as new approaches\nfor producing images, innovation also deeply changed\nthe ways to treat, present and store images. Indeed, the\nrole of radiologists was strengthened by the introduction\nof new technologies. Why should it be different now?\nThe lesson of the past is that apparently disrupting tech￾nologies (e.g. non-x-ray-based modalities, such as ultra￾sound and MRI) that seemed to go beyond radiology\nwere embraced by radiologists. Radiology extended its\nmeaning to radiation-free imaging modalities, now\nencompassing almost all diagnostic medical imaging, as\ndemonstrated by the presence of the word “radiology” in\nnumerous journals titles. This historical effect resulted\nfrom the capacity of radiologists to embrace these\nradiation-free modalities. In addition, electronic systems\nfor reporting examination and archiving images were\nprimarily modelled to serve radiologists.\nThe reasonable doubt is that we are now facing\nmethods that not only cover the production of medical\nimages but also involve detection and characterisation,\nproperly entering the diagnostic process. Indeed, this\nis a new challenge, but also an additional value of AI.\nThe professional role and satisfaction of radiologists\nwill be enhanced by AI if they, as in the past, embrace\nthis technology and educate new generations to use it\nto save time spent on routine and monotonous tasks,\nwith strong encouragement to dedicate the saved time\nto functions that add value and influence patient care.\nThis could also help radiologists feel less worried\nabout the high number of examinations to be reported\nand rather focus on communication with patients and\ninteraction with colleagues in multidisciplinary teams\n[46]. This is the way for radiologists to build their\nbright future.\nWe are at the beginning of the AI era. Until now, the\nclinical application of ML on medical imaging in terms of\ndetection and characterisation have produced results lim￾ited to specific tasks, such as differentiation of normal\nfrom abnormal chest radiographs [41, 42, 47] or mammo￾grams [48, 49]. The application of AI to advanced imaging\nmodalities, such as CT and MRI, is now in its first phase.\nExamples of promising results are the differentiation of\nmalignant from benign chest nodules on CT scans [50],\nFig. 5 Number of publications indexed on EMBASE obtained using the search query (‘artificial intelligence’/exp. OR ‘artificial intelligence’ OR\n‘machine learning’/exp. OR ‘machine learning’ OR ‘deep learning’/exp. OR ‘deep learning’) AND (‘radiology’ OR ‘diagnostic imaging’). EMBASE was\naccessed on April 24, 2018. For each year, the number of publications was subdivided separating opinion articles, reviews and conference\nabstracts from original articles in seven main subgroups considering subspecialty or body part. Other fields of medical imaging different\nfrom those listed above are grouped under the “other topics” label (e.g. dermatology, ophthalmology, head and neck, etc.)\nPesapane et al. European Radiology Experimental (2018) 2:35 Page 6 of 10\n\nthe diagnosis of neurologic and psychiatric diseases [51,\n52], and the identification of biomarkers in glioblastoma\n[53]. Interestingly, MRI has been shown to predict survival\nin women with cervical cancer [54, 55] and in patients\nwith amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [56].\nHowever, AI could already be used to accomplish tasks\nwith a positive, immediate impact, several of them\nalready described by Nance et al. in 2013 [57]:\n1. Prioritisation of reporting: automatic selection of\nfindings deserving faster action.\n2. Comparison of current and previous examinations,\nespecially in oncologic follow-up: tens of minutes are\nneeded for this currently; AI could do this for us;\nwe will supervise the process, extracting data to be\nintegrated into the report and drawing conclusions\nconsidering the clinical context and therapy regimens;\nAI could also take into account the time interval\nbetween examinations\n3. Quick identification of negative studies: at least in\nthis first phase, AI will favour sensitivity and\nnegative predictive value over specificity and\npositive predictive value, finding the normal studies\nand leaving abnormal ones for radiologists [36].\nThis would be particularly useful in high-volume\nscreening settings; this concept of quick negative\nshould also represent a helpful tool for screening\nprogrammes in underserved countries [10, 37].\n4. Aggregation of electronic medical records, allowing\nradiologists to access clinical information to adapt\nprotocols or interpret exams in the full clinical\ncontext.\n5. Automatic recall and rescheduling of patients: for\nfindings deserving of an imaging follow-up.\n6. Immediate use of clinical decision support systems\nfor ordering, interpreting, and defining further\npatient management.\n7. Internal peer-review of reports.\n8. Tracking of residents’ training.\n9. Quality control of technologists’ performance and\ntracked communication between radiologists and\ntechnologists.\n10. Data mining regarding relevant issues, including\nradiation dose [38].\nIn the mid-term perspective, other possibilities are\nopen, such as:\n1. Anticipation of the diagnosis of cancerous lesions in\noncologic patients using texture analysis and other\nadvanced approaches [58].\n2. Prediction of treatment response to therapies for\ntumours, such as intra-arterial treatment for\nhepatocellular carcinoma [59].\n3. Evaluation of the biological relevance of borderline\ncases, such as B3-lesions diagnosed at pathology of\nneedle biopsy of breast imaging findings [60].\n4. Estimation of functional parameters, such as the\nfractional flow reserve from CT coronary\nangiography using deep learning [61].\n5. Detection of perfusion defects and ischaemia, for\nexample in the case of myocardial stress perfusion\ndefects and induced ischaemia [62].\n6. Segmentation and shape modelling, such as brain\ntumour segmentation [63] or, more generally, brain\nstructure segmentation [64].\n7. Reducing diffusion MRI data processing to a single\noptimised step, for example making microstructure\nprediction on a voxel-by-voxel basis as well as\nautomated model-free segmentation from MRI\nvalues [39].\nThe radiologists’ role and cooperation with\ncomputer scientists\nThe key point is the separation of diagnosis and predic￾tion from action and recommendation. Radiologists will\nnot be replaced by machines because radiology practice\nis much more than the simple interpretation of images.\nThe radiologist’s duties also include communication of\ndiagnosis, consideration of patients’ values and prefer￾ences, medical judgment, quality assurance, education,\npolicy-making, interventional procedures, and many\nother tasks that, so far, cannot be performed by com￾puter programmes alone [2].\nNotably, it must be understood that the clinical role of\nradiologists cannot be “saved” only by performing inter￾ventional procedures. Even though interventional radi￾ology is a fundamental asset to improve the clinical profile\nof radiology [45, 65–67], radiologists must act more as cli￾nicians, applying their clinical knowledge in answering\ndiagnostic questions and guiding decision-making, which\nrepresent their main tasks. Radiologists should keep their\nhuman control in the loop, considering clinical, personal\nand societal contexts in ways that AI alone is not able to\ndo. So far, AI is neither astute nor empathic. Thus, physi￾cians (i.e., we say here radiologists) remain essential for\nmedical practice, because ingenuity in medicine requires\nunique human characteristics [40, 68]. If the time needed\nfor image interpretation were shortened, radiologists\nwould be able to focus on inference to improve patient\ncare. If AI is based on a huge increase in information, the\nhallmark of intelligence is in reducing information to what\nis relevant [69].\nHowever, it is impossible to exclude that the efficiency\ngain provided by AI may lead to a need for fewer radiolo￾gists. Of note, in the United States the competition for\nresidency positions in radiology has decreased over time\n[70], potentially allowing for a better match between\nPesapane et al. European Radiology Experimental (2018) 2:35 Page 7 of 10\n\nsupply and demand for residency positions. However, also\nthe opposite hypothesis cannot be excluded: AI-enhanced\nradiology may require more professionals in the field, in￾cluding radiologists. In general, the history of automation\nshows that jobs are not lost. Rather, roles are reshaped;\nhumans are displaced to tasks needing a human element\n[12]. The gain in efficiency provided by AI will allow radi￾ologists to perform more value-added tasks, such as inte￾grating patients’ clinical and imaging information, having\nmore professional interactions, becoming more visible to\npatients and playing a vital role in integrated clinical teams\n[46]. In this way, AI will not replace radiologists; yet, those\nradiologists who take advantage of the potential of AI will\nreplace the ones who refuse this crucial challenge.\nFinally, we should remember that AI mimics human\nintelligence. Radiologists are key people for several\ncurrent AI challenges, such as the creation of\nhigh-quality training datasets, definition of the clinical\ntask to address, and interpretation of obtained results.\nMany labelled studies and findings provided by experi￾enced radiologists are needed; those datasets are diffi￾cult to find and are time-consuming, implying high\ncosts [3]. However, even if crucial, the radiologist’s role\nshould not be confined to data labelling. Radiologists\nmay play a pivotal role in the identification of clinical\napplications where AI methods may make the difference.\nIndeed, they represent the final user of these technologies,\nwho knows where they can be applied to improve patient\ncare. For this reason, their point of view is crucial to opti￾mise the use of AI-based solutions in the clinical setting.\nFinally, the application of AI-based algorithms often leads\nto the creation of complex data that need to be inter￾preted and linked to their clinical utility. In this scenario,\nradiologists may play a crucial role in data interpretation,\ncooperating with data scientists in the definition of useful\nresults.\nRadiologists should negotiate the supply of these valu￾able datasets and clinical knowledge with a guiding role in\nthe clinical application of AI programmes. This implies an\nincreasing partnership with bioengineers and computer\nscientists. Working with them in research and develop￾ment of AI applications in radiology is a strategic issue\n[45]. These professionals should be embedded in radio￾logical departments, becoming everyday partners. Creating\nthis kind of “multidisciplinary AI team” will help to ensure\npatient safety standards are met and creates judicial trans￾parency, which allows legal liability to be assigned to the\nradiologist component human authority [71].\nAnother topical issue that needs to be faced are the\nlegal implications of AI systems in healthcare. As soon\nas AI systems start making autonomous decisions about\ndiagnoses and prognosis, and stop being only a support\ntool, a problem arises as to whether, when something\n‘goes wrong’ following a clinical decision made by an AI\napplication, the reader (namely, the radiologist) or the\ndevice itself or its designer/builder is to be considered at\nfault [72]. In our opinion, ethical and legal responsibility\nfor decision making in healthcare will remain a matter\nof the natural intelligence of physicians. From this view￾point, it is probable that the multidisciplinary AI team\nwill take responsibility in difficult cases, considering\nrelevant, but not always conclusive, what AI provided. It\nhas been already demonstrated that groups of human\nand AI agents working together make more accurate\npredictions compared to humans or AI alone, promising\nto achieve higher levels of accuracy in imaging diagnosis\nand even prognosis [71].\nAlthough the techniques of AI differ from diagnosis to\nprognosis, both applications still need validation, and\nthis is challenging due to the large amount of data\nneeded to achieve robust results [73]. Therefore, rigor￾ous evaluation criteria and reporting guidelines for AI\nneed to be developed in order to establish its role in\nradiology and, more generally, in medicine [22].\nConclusions\nAI will surely impact radiology, and more quickly than\nother medical fields. It will change radiology practice\nmore than anything since Roentgen. Radiologists can\nplay a leading role in this oncoming change [74].\nAn uneasiness among radiologists to embrace AI may\nbe compared with the reluctance among pilots to em￾brace autopilot technology in the early days of auto￾mated aircraft aviation. However, radiologists are used to\nfacing technological challenges because, since the begin￾nings of its history, radiology has been the playfield of\ntechnological development.\nAn updated radiologist should be aware of the basic\nprinciples of ML/DL systems, of the characteristic of\ndatasets to train them, and their limitations. Radiologists\ndo not need to know the deepest details of these sys￾tems, but they must learn the technical vocabulary used\nby data scientists to efficiently communicate with them.\nThe time to work for and with AI in radiology is now.\nAbbreviations\n3D: Three-dimensional; AI: Artificial intelligence; ANN: Artificial neural\nnetwork; CAD: Computer-aided detection/diagnosis; CNN: Convolutional\nneural network; CT: Computed tomography; DL: Deep learning; ML: Machine\nlearning; MRI: Magnetic resonance imaging\nAvailability of data and materials\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the\ncorresponding author, MC, upon reasonable request.\nFunding\nThis study was supported by Ricerca Corrente funding from Italian Ministry\nof Health to IRCCS Policlinico San Donato.\nPesapane et al.

The majority of these studies involve magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuroradiology, making up around two-thirds of the total number of publications. While some experts believe that AI poses a threat to radiologists, the authors argue that it presents a significant opportunity for improvement instead. They highlight that AI algorithms analyze medical images similarly to humans, identifying patterns and providing information about the likelihood of certain conditions. However, there is still a long way to go before AI replaces radiologists entirely, as they bring unique skills beyond image analysis, such as clinical judgment and communication with other healthcare professionals. Therefore, AI should be seen as a tool to enhance rather than replace radiologists. The authors suggest that further research is required to address the challenges associated with implementing AI in radiology, particularly regarding data privacy and security concerns. Overall, the authors conclude that AI has the potential to significantly benefit radiology, improving efficiency, reducing errors, and enabling earlier intervention, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes."}

This study aimed to\nexamine whether consensus and stability in the Delphi process can be ascertained by descriptive\nevaluation of trends in participants' views.\nMethods: A three round email-based Delphi required participants (n = 12) to verify their level of\nagreement with 8 statements, write comments on each if they considered it necessary and rank the\nstatements for importance. Each statement was analysed quantitatively by the percentage of\nagreement ratings, importance rankings and the amount of comments made for each statement,\nand qualitatively using thematic analysis. Importance rankings between rounds were compared by\ncalculating Kappa values to observe trends in how the process impacts on subject's views.\nResults: Evolution of consensus was shown by increase in agreement percentages, convergence of\nrange with standard deviations of importance ratings, and a decrease in the number of comments\nmade. Stability was demonstrated by a trend of increasing Kappa values.\nConclusion: Following the original use of Delphi in social sciences, Delphi is suggested to be an\neffective way to gain and measure group consensus in healthcare. However, the proposed analytical\nprocess should be followed to ensure maximum validity of results in Delphi methodology for\nimproved evidence of consensual decision-making.\nBackground\nThe Delphi technique is suggested to be an effective way\nto gain and measure group consensus in healthcare [1].\nDelphi was developed by Dalkey and colleagues at the\nRAND Corporation in the 1950's, and is a structured proc￾ess requiring experts to respond to non-leading, unambig￾uous statements with the aim of achieving consensus.\nUsing a systematic fashion of repeating rounds, where\neach subsequent set of statements is built on the\nresponses to the preceding ones, consensus is sought\nthrough the feedback of information and iteration [2],\nand the process is terminated when consensus is reached.\nAnonymity offered by Delphi can reduce the inhibition\nnormally occurring in decision-making as individuals will\nbe more open with their answers.\nAlthough originally used as a methodological tool in\nsocial sciences, recently there has been a rise in the use of\nDelphi in healthcare research [3-9]. Delphi characteristics\nhave been consistently described in the definitive texts\nPublished: 29 November 2007\nBMC Medical Research Methodology 2007, 7:52 doi:10.1186/1471-2288-7-52\nReceived: 25 June 2007\nAccepted: 29 November 2007\nThis article is available from: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2288/7/52\n© 2007 Holey et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n\nBMC Medical Research Methodology 2007, 7:52 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2288/7/52\nPage 2 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\n[2,10,11], and in the paper by Caws [12], which consid￾ered consensus theories in healthcare. Importantly how￾ever, there is no general agreement in the literature that\ndefines specific criteria to use to determine when consen￾sus has been achieved, i.e. when to stop a Delphi study.\nEvidence on the evaluation of Delphi consensus is lim￾ited; researchers have not yet described how to determine\nwhen an exact level of the consensus is reached in Delphi.\nDelphi studies have been used to develop and identify\nconsensus by experts on a given topic. As interest has\ngrown in the analysis of the data produced by this\nmethod, authors have attempted to clarify the relevant\nconcepts.\nIt has been suggested that consensus is the same as agree￾ment and that agreement can be determined by:\n1) the aggregate of judgements (the pool of individual\njudgements) [2],\n2) a move to a subjective level of central tendency [13],\n3) or alternatively, by confirming stability, which is \"the\nconsistency of answers between successive rounds of the\nstudy [13].\"\nThe first of these occurs within each Delphi round. The\nsecond and third occur between rounds. Researchers have\nbeen inconsistent in their use of these concepts. In addi￾tion some researchers support the use of pre-determined\nlevels of consensus to reduce research bias [14] whilst oth￾ers argue that applying numerical values to subjective\nresponses gives an unconvincing analysis [15].\nScheibe et al.[16] suggest that stability should be used in\nDelphi studies to compare the views of participants, as\nthey believed that reporting a percentage of expressed\nviews does not reflect the nature of Delphi to look for\nresistance to natural centralisation of views. They also\nnote complete stability will be difficult to attain as there\nwill always be some \"oscillatory movements.\" A subse￾quent study used stability rather than agreement as termi￾nation criteria for Delphi [13]. Dajani et al. [13] propose\nthe use of Chi-squared (χ2) to test for stability. However,\nthis cannot be considered to test stability in Delphi stud￾ies as it will determine \"the independence of the rounds\nfrom responses found in them\" [13] not the stability of\nresponses between separate rounds. A study by Chaffin\nand Talley [17] using χ2 to determine individual stability\nprior to group stability was developed from the work of\nDajani et al., and therefore this should also be viewed\nwith caution. Since these works few examples of χ2 as a\nstability measure appear in Delphi literature. More\nrecently Greatorex & Dexter used means and standard\ndeviations (SD) for comparing movement between Del￾phi rounds as a measure of both stability and convergence\n[18].\nIn 1998 the NHS Health Technology Assessment group\nproduced a detailed report on the requirements of effec￾tive consensus development methods [1] yet could not\nidentify an appropriate statistical measure for reporting a\nmove towards consensus, identified by central tendency\nin Delphi. They suggested reasoned feedback was advisa￾ble as well as central tendency measures but did not iden￾tify a statistical method which could do this. This lack of\nunambiguous criteria for defining consensus clearly\nshows that further research is required in this area.\nAim of the Study\nIn order to reduce the subjectivity in stopping criteria used\nin Delphi studies, this study aimed to examine whether\nconsensus and stability in the Delphi process can be ascer￾tained by descriptive evaluation of trends in participants'\nviews. We evaluated the evolution of consensus and sta￾bility by examining agreement percentages, importance\nrankings (based on simple descriptive statistics) and\nKappa values. These were used to explore how quantita￾tive results could inform Delphi users, firstly on the pro￾duction of central tendency/consensus, and secondly on\nstability, thus reducing subjectivity in reporting Delphi\nresults. The use of simple descriptive statistics, as used in\nprevious work [18], makes this method very user-friendly.\nMethods\nAn email-based Delphi study was undertaken and com￾parative statistical testing applied. Ethical approval was\nobtained from University of Teesside and informed con￾sent obtained from each participant. A convenience heter￾ogeneous sample (n = 12) of volunteer nursing,\noccupational therapy and physiotherapy students. A three\nround email-based Delphi study was undertaken follow￾ing a pilot, which checked whether the statements were\nclear, unambiguous and non-leading. Statements were\ntaken directly from the paper by McCallin [19] which\nreviewed interdisciplinary practice, a topic in which all\nstudents were equivalent experts due to their experiences\nas students. The views and opinions reached were irrele￾vant to the studying question, which explored the change\nof the opinions towards consensus, rather than the nature\nof the consensus itself. In each round, participants were\ninvited to respond by scaling each statement on degree of\nagreement and commenting on each statement as desired,\n(see example in Table 1), and finally ranking the state￾ments in order of importance, (see example in Table 2).\nBetween rounds views were analysed using Colazzi's 7-\nstage thematic analysis, modified from Holloway &\n\nBMC Medical Research Methodology 2007, 7:52 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2288/7/52\nPage 3 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nWheeler [20]. Quantitative analysis of the Delphi\nincluded calculations of:\n1. Percentage response rates,\n2. Percentages for each level of agreement for each state￾ment to compensate for varying response rates,\n3. Median, range and their associated group rankings\nusing the importance ratings,\n4. Mean (SD) and their associated group rankings using\nthe importance ratings,\n5. Weighted Kappa (K) values to compare chance-elimi￾nated agreement between rounds.\nFor the following round, statements were rephrased if\nappropriate with the aim of moving towards consensus,\nbased on the level of agreement and the majority theme\nhighlighted. Successive rounds consisted of statements\n(some rephrased) percentage agreement levels, anony￾mous feedback from the previous round to show the\nrange of views received, and the importance rankings\nusing the median rank values. Participants were requested\nto read the feedback before responding again to state￾ments.\nScaling methods of agreement and importance were\nadapted from Sim & Wright [21] and have been previously\nused and described in Delphi literature [2,22,23]. Agree￾ment scales were particularly relevant as they gave an\nopportunity for participants to scale each statement inde￾pendently. To make comparisons between rounds and for\nfeedback, percentage agreements were calculated for each\nlevel of the scale to compensate for varying response rates.\nWeighted Kappa (K) statistics were calculated for the\nwithin-subject level of agreement in their importance\nrankings between two rounds, not the level of agreement\nbetween participants. K values show a chance-corrected\nproportional agreement [24]. A weighted Kappa was\nappropriate as un-weighted does not take into account the\nmagnitude of discrepancies between disagreements\n[25,26]. SPSS was unable to calculate the K-values because\nof the requirement for a weighted Kappa. Therefore Excel\nspreadsheets and handwritten crosstabs were used based\non the descriptions by Armitage et al. [27] and interpreta￾tion by Anthony [28], Table 3 (see Fliess [29] for a full\nmathematical explanation and justification of the Kappa\nvalidity). K-values were used to compare agreement of\nimportance rankings between rounds for each statement\nand Chaffin & Talley [17] stated an \"individual stability\ntest for Delphi studies provides more information than a\ngroup stability test,\" therefore justifying the use of Kappa.\nResults\nThe results section summarises the Delphi in terms of\nhow consensus and stability evolved through rounds 1 to\n3 by looking at the: -\n• Agreement percentages,\n• Importance rankings,\n• Statement evolution,\n• Theme production,\n• Kappa values.\nTable 3: Adapted from Anthony (1999) showing the level of \nagreement represented by K-values.\nK-value Agreement level\n0.0–0.2 Poor agreement\n0.21–0.4 Fair agreement\n0.41–0.6 Moderate agreement\n0.61–0.8 Substantial agreement\n0.81–1 Almost perfect agreement\nTable 2: Example of lay-out as given for participants to rank \nimportance of statements at the end of round 1\nRank Role definition is a significant factor underpinning \nsuccessful teamwork.\nRank Collaboration relies on changing attitudes.\nRank Collective understanding develops when health \nprofessionals have opportunity to get to know each \nother in a more personal sense.\nRank The frequency of team meetings is the single most \ncritical factor that fosters collaborative teamwork.\nTable 1: Example of lay-out as presented for statement 1, round \n1\n1.

The range interval and SD decreased to low levels\n(difference of 2 and 0.60 respectively). By the end this\nstatement had the lowest range and SD, suggesting great￾est stability and consensus, also it had a low number of\ncomments (3). When the median and mean were equal\nthe range, 1–3, and SD, 0.60 were low. Importance rank￾ing was always high (second place).\nStatement 2 (Table 5)\nThere was a variety of themes generated (6) in round 1,\nsuggesting divergence, changing to 3 themes in round 2,\nthen 2 in round 3, suggesting convergence.\nFor statement 2 there was an increase in agreement\nbetween round 1 and 2, then divergence rather than con￾vergence occurred between rounds 2 and 3. Based on the\nSD there was less consensus for this statement in round 3.\nStatement 3 (Table 6)\nNew themes were generated in round three, also sugges￾tive of instability. Interestingly, the two non-responders\nfrom round 2 disagreed with the third round statement\naffecting the percentage of agreement. This was 1 of only\n2 statements showing disagreement in round 3 and show￾ing an increase in disagreement between any rounds.\nMean and median ranks both show this statement became\nless important to the participants, yet there was always a\n2-interval difference between these ranks.\nStatement 4 (Table 7)\nFour themes were highlighted in round one. Despite the\nchange in agreement between rounds two and three only\none comment was given in round three, the least number\nof comments for any statement throughout the Delphi.\nAn increase in those strongly agreeing (from 8% to 80%)\nwas observed for round 2, as shown in Table 7. The level\nof those strongly agreeing lowered in round 3 (to 58%).\nMean and median values both showed increase in impor￾tance rankings. As in statement 1, when median and mean\nwere equal, range and S.D were lowest.\nTable 5: Agreement and importance values for statement 2\nRound 1 Round 2 Round 3\nAgreement Strongly agree 27% 0% 25%\nAgree 55% 100% 67%\nNo opinion 9% 0% 8%\nDisagree 9% 0% 0%\nStrongly disagree 0% 0% 0%\nImportance Median 4 4 4\nRange 1–8 2–7 3–8\nRank 4 4 = 4\nMean 4.58 4.10 4.33\nStandard deviation 2.50 1.45 1.78\nRank 4 4 4\nTable 4: Agreement and importance values for statement 1\nRound 1 Round 2 Round 3\nAgreement Strongly agree 42% 40% 50%\nAgree 42% 60% 50%\nNo opinion 8% 0% 0%\nDisagree 8% 0% 0%\nStrongly disagree 0% 0% 0%\nImportance Median 3 2 2\nRange 3–7 1–4 1–3\nRank 2 2 2\nMean 3.33 2.20 2.00\nStandard deviation 1.78 1.03 0.60\nRank 2 2 2\n\nBMC Medical Research Methodology 2007, 7:52 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2288/7/52\nPage 5 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nStatement 5 (Table 8)\nNew themes were generated in round 3 suggesting stabil￾ity had not yet occurred.\nFor this statement agreement percentages and ranges did\nnot vary appreciably still showing disagreement in round\n3, suggesting stability. Although only changing by 0.06\nbetween rounds 2 and 3, the SD suggests there is still con￾vergence. The statement became less important, ranked 3\nto 5.\nStatement 6 (Table 9)\nRound 1 produced 5 themes. In round 3 all responses\nreflected different themes, previous themes and new\nthemes suggesting the views of participants had not been\nexhausted. Agreement increased over the 3 rounds,\ninversely to the ranking of importance. Both the median\nand the mean define a move towards lesser importance\nwith the progression of rounds. The range intervals of 6, 5\nand 5, over the rounds suggest consensus was weak yet\nstability had occurred but the SD was still lowering sug￾gesting continued convergence.\nStatement 7 (Table 10)\nIn round 1 there were 2 themes, which were reflected\nagain in rounds 2 and 3, although the amount of partici￾pants responding decreased to 3 in both round 2 and\nround 3. This statement was consistently high on agree￾ment and importance always ranked first. However, range\ninterval of 4, and SD of 1.17, were not the lowest observed\nin round 3, suggesting the possibility of further conver￾gence.\nStatement 8 (Table 11)\nOnly 4 comments were obtained in round 1 all reflecting\nagreement. Round 2 instigated only three comments, still\nreflecting agreement. This was the only statement for\nwhich the number of comments increased in round 3\nthese included new themes, suggesting instability. How￾ever, agreement increased for this statement. Both mean\nand median values showed the importance ranking lower\nbut the range and SD both showed a move towards con￾sensus.\nKappa agreement (Table 12)\nIn general, K-values increased between rounds when\nrounds progressed, and when adjacent rounds were com￾pared as opposed to round 1 Vs round 3.

Statement 4\nhad the second lowest SD by round 3 yet never achieved a\nK > 0.5. Statement 1, 3 and 7 got the 3 highest Kappa val￾ues, comparing round 2 and 3.\nDiscussion\nThe Delphi results show a change in participants' views\ntowards consensus and stability as indicated by a trend\ntowards:\n• an increase in percentage agreements\n• convergence of importance rankings\n• increase in Kappa values\n• a decrease in comments as rounds progressed\nAn increase was observed in percentage agreements for all\nstatements over the 3 rounds with only 2 statements\n(Tables 6 and 8) showing some disagreement by round 3,\ncompared to 7 statements in round 1. This demonstrates\nthe evolution of consensus. Statement 4 (Table 7) had the\nhighest disagreement percentage in round 1, yet full agree￾ment by round 3, demonstrating that views could alter\nconsiderably.\nOscillatory movements at individual and group level were\nconsistent with those described by Scheibe et al.[16]. A\ndeviation in the level of agreement, \"strongly agree\" or\n\"agree,\" between rounds was evident in most statements,\nand was not dependent on changes to statement phrasing\n(Table 7). The phenomenon of 2 participants failing to\nrespond to round 2 had a bearing on the oscillatory move￾ment, their lack of response gave a misleading bias\ntowards agreement (Table 6). Individually both these par￾ticipants disagreed to this statement, demonstrating dis￾advantage in the use of percentages. It is worth noting that\nnon-responders can impact significantly on the sample\nsize when interpreting percentages and this could lead to\nmisleading oscillatory movements as suggested by\nScheibe et al.[16].\nTable 9: Agreement and importance values for statement 6\nRound 1 Round 2 Round 3\nAgreement Strongly agree 25% 10% 25%\nAgree 42% 60% 58%\nNo opinion 0% 0% 17%\nDisagree 33% 20% 0%\nStrongly disagree 0% 10% 0%\nImportance Median 5.5 7 7\nRange 1–7 3–8 3–8\nRank 7 8 7\nMean 4.83 6.40 6.33\nStandard deviation 2.21 1.65 1.56\nRank 6 7 7\nTable 8: Agreement and importance values for statement 5\nRound 1 Round 2 Round 3\nAgreement Strongly agree 25% 10% 17%\nAgree 42% 60% 58%\nNo opinion 25% 20% 17%\nDisagree 9% 10% 8%\nStrongly disagree 0% 0% 0%\nImportance Median 3.5 4 5.5\nRange 1–8 2–7 3–8\nRank 3 4 = 5\nMean 4.25 4.40 5.67\nStandard deviation 2.53 1.78 1.72\nRank 3 5 5\n\nBMC Medical Research Methodology 2007, 7:52 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2288/7/52\nPage 7 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTable 11: Agreement and importance values for statement 8\nRound 1 Round 2 Round 3\nAgreement Strongly agree 17% 30% 25%\nAgree 50% 50% 75%\nNo opinion 25% 20% 0%\nDisagree 8% 0% 0%\nStrongly disagree 0% 0% 0%\nImportance Median 6 6.5 7\nRange 3–8 3–8 5–8\nRank 8 7 8\nMean 5.92 6.30 6.17\nStandard deviation 1.56 1.77 1.11\nRank 8 6 6\nTable 10: Agreement and importance values for statement 7\nRound 1 Round 2 Round 3\nAgreement Strongly agree 50% 70% 67%\nAgree 42% 30% 33%\nNo opinion 8% 0% 0%\nDisagree 0% 0% 0%\nStrongly disagree 0% 0% 0%\nImportance Median 2 1 1\nRange 1–7 1–6 1–5\nRank 1 1 1\nMean 2.67 1.90 1.50\nStandard deviation 1.97 1.73 1.17\nRank 1 1 1\nTable 12: Kappa values for within-subject agreement in importance rankings between rounds of each statement\nAgreement between Rounds 1 and 2 Agreement between Rounds 2 and 3 Agreement between first and last round (1 and 3)\nStatement 1 0.642 0.836 0.432\nStatement 2 0.697 0.516 0.596\nStatement 3 0.600 0.750 0.533\nStatement 4 0.498 0.490 0.470\nStatement 5 0.696 0.669 0.627\nStatement 6 0.627 0.641 0.548\nStatement 7 0.313 0.711 0.375\nStatement 8 0.515 0.690 0.519\n\nBMC Medical Research Methodology 2007, 7:52 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2288/7/52\nPage 8 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nThe median and mean values for importance show the\ngroup aggregate rank, whereas ranges and SD show the\nspread, i.e. disagreement [18] of the group's responses\naround that result. Both range and SD decreased as rounds\nprogressed, showing centralisation of views i.e. increased\nagreement or convergence. Comparison of importance\nrankings shows similarity in medians and means, equal or\nwithin one interval difference (Tables 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10).\nDifferences of 2 intervals were shown for statements 3 and\n8 (Tables 6 and 11), which were 2 of the statements con￾sistently ranked the least important. These discrepancies\nbetween means and medians could be explained by par￾ticipants giving less attention to statements they consider\nleast important.\nWhile a decrease in range generally reflected a decrease in\nSD, there was no direct relationship between them. For\nexample, between rounds 2 and 3, in statement 6 the SDs\ndecreased from 1.65 and 1.56 but the ranges stayed con￾stant, at 3–8. This highlights the different information\neach provides, SDs give an indication of the aggregate\njudgement where as ranges summarise the outliers views.\nAlso between statements, equal ranges were represented\nby different SDs. For example statements 2 and 3 had a\nrange of 1–8 in round 1, but standard deviations of 2.50\nand 2.27, respectively. These findings expand on Greato￾rex & Dexter's conclusion [18] that each individual Delphi\nrequires acceptable values of both mean and SD to repre￾sent consensus, by identifying that each statement must\nhave individual values to determine convergence. How￾ever, this has implications for Delphi research as:-\n• there may be increased potential for bias as researchers\nwill need to make individual judgements on acceptable\nconvergence levels for each statement,\n• Alternatively, preconceived levels of convergence to\ndetermine consensus, as suggested by Williams & Webb\n[15], would be difficult to predict.\nWhen interpreting the mean and median importance\nrankings, some between-test validity can be demon￾strated. For example, when the mean and median were\nequal the lowest ranges and SDs were observed (Tables 4\nand 7). Adding and subtracting the SD from the mean\nmore accurately mirrored the range as the rounds pro￾gressed (table 4). As the SD represents the majority of sub￾jects' variation around the mean, this shows there were\nfewer outliers as rounds progressed, again indicating\nlower disagreement [18], or increased convergence.\nAs expected, the greatest difference between K-values was\nbetween round 1 and 3 (Table 12), with K-values nearing\n1, and greater agreement for round 2 versus 3. Observed\npoints from K-values show no association with the ranges,\nSDs, medians, means or ranks. Possible explanations for\nthis are the elimination of chance in Kappa and the com￾parison of between rounds in Kappa rather than values\nwithin a particular round. Also Kappa-crosstabs plot indi￾viduals' rank from one round against their rank in the next\nround, therefore K-values measure the value of agreement\nfor individuals between two rounds, not agreement between\ndifferent participants within a round. It was interesting to\nobserve the apparent contradiction, between the results\nfor Kappa and percentage agreement for statement 7. This\nmay have been due to the small range of answers as com￾pared with other statements, because Kappa is affected by\nrange. This highlights the need to use a range of descrip￾tive statistics in Delphi analysis.\nGenerally the number of comments decreased in each\nround. However, statement 8 (Table 11) did not show a\ndecrease in comments but followed similar quantitative\ndata patterns as other statements. One participant did\ncomment on misunderstanding statement 8 in round 1,\nmisunderstanding of the statement by participants possi￾bly leading to the equivalent of a loss of a Delphi round\nfor that statement until the meaning was clarified. This is\nvalidated by the rise in SD and range (Table 11), and rise\nin SD for statement 4, which was also misunderstood in\nround 1 (Table 7).\nNew themes were generated in round 3 for the 4 state￾ments of least importance (Tables 6, 8, 9 and 11), suggest￾ing instability, as views had not been exhausted. This was\nsometimes contradictory to the SDs and ranges which\nshowed low scores, however they were still converging/\nlowering therefore showing instability. Although aggre￾gating judgements will reduce the strength of the outliers\nviews in quantitative data, with subjective views outliers\ncan raise important issues not yet considered by others,\nand therefore new themes should not be ignored and\nrounds continued until views are exhausted.\nStatements 1 and 4 which received fewer comments in\nround 3 had the lowest SDs. Because quantitative analysis\naggregates participants' judgements, outlying individual\njudgements are not represented. However, the reduction\nin comments does support the lowering of range intervals\nand SD, substantiating the evolution of consensus and\nvalidating quantitative data with qualitative data.\nThe results presented here demonstrate two points that\ncan be used to improve Delphi studies in future. Firstly,\nthe results have demonstrated that the mean and SD,\nwhen combined with the range and medians, can be used\nto show whether convergence has occurred, by a move￾ment towards central tendency. This is in agreement with\nthe findings of Greatorex and Dexter [18]. The amount of\nconvergence and therefore the strength of agreement is\n\nBMC Medical Research Methodology 2007, 7:52 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2288/7/52\nPage 9 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nindicated by a comparison of SD (strength of aggregate\njudgement) and range (larger ranges being indicative of\noutliers views). Secondly, high or increasing Kappa values\ndemonstrate stability of individuals' views within the\ngroup and the level of agreement between rounds. Fur￾thermore, reductions in the number of subjective com￾ments reinforce the quantitative observations of\nconvergence. It is rare to see this in Delphi studies and it\nis proposed that in future Delphi studies, this analytical\ncombination is used.\nThere are limitations to this study. This study used a small\nsample size therefore the results should be treated with\nsome caution, and followed up by a larger study. However\nthis offered the greatest opportunity for analysing all qual￾itative data, because an increased sample size would have\nled to saturation of data, and it is not uncommon for Del￾phi studies to use this type of sample size.\nConclusion\nUsing standard descriptive statistics and Kappa calcula￾tions in conjunction with thematic analysis and the\nnumber of comments generated, it was possible to dem￾onstrate movement towards consensus and stability in\nthis Delphi study. Following the original use of Delphi in\nsocial science, Delphi is suggested to be an effective way to\ngain and measure group consensus in healthcare [1].\nThere is potential here to add clarification to the use of a\nvery subjective methodology. It is suggested that a combi￾nation of the simple descriptive statistics as presented here\nbe used to reduce subjectivity and ensure maximum valid￾ity of results in Delphi methodology for improved evi￾dence of consensual decision-making. The trends\nobserved in this exploratory study suggest that a larger\nstudy is warranted, following the same approach.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter￾ests.\nAuthors' contributions\nJLF and EAH designed the study.

The study presents a case study using a three-round email-based Delphi study with a convenience heterogenous sample of student nurses, occupational therapists, and physiotherapists. The statements were related to interdisciplinary practice, and the views and opinions reached were irrelevant to the study's question, which focused on exploring the change of opinions toward consensus rather than the nature of consensus itself. The study analyzed agreement percentages, importance rankings, statement evolution, theme production, and Kappa values to evaluate consensus and stability. The results showed that a combination of simple descriptive statistics could help reduce subjectivity and improve the validity of Delphi methodology for better evidence of consensual decision-making. The study suggests that a larger study is needed to confirm these findings.\n\nCompeting interests: The authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\nAuthors' contributions: JLF and EAH designed the study.

However, the obstacles for\nimplementation of AI/ML in daily clinical practice are numerous, especially regarding the regulation of these technologies.\nTherefore, we provide an insight into the currently available AI/ML-based medical devices and algorithms that have been approved\nby the US Food & Drugs Administration (FDA). We aimed to raise awareness of the importance of regulatory bodies, clearly stating\nwhether a medical device is AI/ML based or not. Cross-checking and validating all approvals, we identified 64 AI/ML based, FDA\napproved medical devices and algorithms. Out of those, only 29 (45%) mentioned any AI/ML-related expressions in the official FDA\nannouncement. The majority (85.9%) was approved by the FDA with a 510(k) clearance, while 8 (12.5%) received de novo pathway\nclearance and one (1.6%) premarket approval (PMA) clearance. Most of these technologies, notably 30 (46.9%), 16 (25.0%), and 10\n(15.6%) were developed for the fields of Radiology, Cardiology and Internal Medicine/General Practice respectively. We have\nlaunched the first comprehensive and open access database of strictly AI/ML-based medical technologies that have been approved\nby the FDA. The database will be constantly updated.\nnpj Digital Medicine (2020) 3:118 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-020-00324-0\nINTRODUCTION\nThe 2010s has brought a rise in the number of studies and papers\ndiscussing the role of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine\nlearning (ML) in medicine and healthcare (AI/ML). The number of\nlife science papers describing AI/ML rose from 596 in 2010 to\n12,422 in 2019. While we are at the beginning of the AI/ML era, the\nexpectations are high and experts foresee that AI/ML shows\npotential for diagnosing, managing and treating a wide variety of\nmedical conditions1\n.\nIndeed, AI/ML-based technologies have been shown to support\nseveral medical specialties from radiology2 and oncology3 to\nophthalmology4 and general medical decision-making5\n. ML\nmodels have been shown to reduce waiting times6\n; improve\nmedication adherence7\n; customize insulin dosages8\n; or help\ninterpret magnetic resonance images9\n, among others.\nDespite its promise, the obstacles for implementation of AI/ML\nin daily clinical practice are numerous10. These include issues with\ntransparency surrounding these software programs, the inherent\nbias in the data they are fed with and how secure they are. A\ncrucial element shaping these obstacles is regulating such\ntechnologies. The very use of the term AI requires further\nclarification, as multiple subtypes have been proposed, and its\nmeaning can be vague. For the sake of further investments and\nthe public image, companies tend to overuse the term AI, when in\nfact they have developed algorithms which are not AI/ML-based\nper se.\nWe classify a technology as AI/ML based if official FDA\nannouncements, communications by the company or other\npublicly available information resources used the expressions\n‘deep learning,’ ‘machine learning,’ ‘deep neural networks,’\n‘artificial intelligence,’ and/or ‘AI’ to describe the technology11.\nFor simplicity, we use the term “AI/ML-based” to denote these\ntechnologies in this paper.With the increasing expertise and\nattention on AI/ML in the medical field, the opportunities and\npossible implications of its use are the topics of an ongoing\ndebate12. A crucial element in this implementation debate is\nregulating such technologies.\nAs studies about AI’s role in medicine show, its use cases and\ncompanies developing such technologies have been skyrocketing,\nregulatory bodies, such as the US Food & Drugs Administration\n(FDA) and the European Medicine Agency (EMA), have tried to\ntackle its regulation and implementation. As the FDA has shown\nleadership regarding the adoption of AI/ML-based medical\ntechnologies, with a specific framework for AI/ML-based algo￾rithms, we chose it as an example for further analysis13.\nBecause of the high-risk nature of these medical devices and\nthe unknown consequences of using AI/ML for medical decision￾making and data analysis, the FDA has stringent regulatory\nrequirements for medical device licensing. Developers of AI/ML￾based medical devices and algorithms have to go through\nrigorous processes that are time and resource consuming. This\ncan be considered pivotal as a barrier for the introduction of AI/ML\nin medicine.\nBefore medical hardware or software is legally made available in\nthe US market, the parent company has to submit it to the FDA for\nevaluation. For medically oriented AI/ML-based algorithms, the\nregulatory body has three levels of clearance, namely, 510(k)14,\npremarket approval15 and the de novo pathway16, each of which\nneeds specific criteria to be fulfilled in order to be granted (Table 1).\nFor the development and marketing of medical algorithms, the\nFDA’s stringent regulatory requirements pose important chal￾lenges to the companies developing them. Before, every new\nproduct had to go through the regulatory process. However, as\ncompanies update their algorithms on a much shorter time scale,\n1\nDepartment of Surgery, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands. 2\nMedical Imaging Center, University Medical Center\nGroningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands. 3\nThe Medical Futurist Institute, Budapest, Hungary. 4\nDepartment of Behavioural Sciences, Semmelweis\nUniversity, Budapest, Hungary. ✉email: berci@medicalfuturist.com\nwww.nature.com/npjdigitalmed\nSeoul National University Bundang Hospital\n1234567890():,;\n\nnamely in days, the FDA has realized that this process might\nbecome impossible to maintain. Therefore, the FDA started to\nconsider “a total product lifecycle-based regulatory framework for\nthese technologies that would allow for modifications to be made\nfrom real-world learning and adaptation, while still ensuring that\nthe safety and effectiveness of the software as a medical device is\nmaintained”\n13.\nTo date, the FDA has cleared or approved several medical\ndevices using “locked” algorithms. They define a “locked”\nalgorithm as an algorithm that provides the same result each\ntime the same input is applied to it and does not change.\nHowever, many recent medical devices, especially when AI/ML\nbased, use algorithms that change and can adapt over time; these\nare described by the FDA as adaptive algorithms, for which\ncurrent regulatory frameworks were not designed17. The power of\nthese AI/ML-based algorithms lies within the ability to continu￾ously learn, where change to the algorithm might only be realized\nafter the device or software has been distributed for use and could\nlearn from real-world experience.\nAn attempt to solve this issue was proposed in the FDA’s\nproposed regulatory framework from 201918, that “elaborates on a\npotential approach to premarket review for artificial intelligence\nand ML-driven software modifications”\n13. It is recognized by the\nFDA that these adaptive algorithms require a total product\nlifecycle (TPLC) regulatory approach, enabling rapid cycle of\nproduct improvement with effective safeguards.\nThis TPLC approach is based on the Digital Health Software\nPrecertification (Pre-Cert) Program19, allowing for the evaluation of\nSoftware as a Medical Device (SaMD) products throughout the\nlifecycle.\nHowever, the FDA does not ask companies to categorize their\ntechnology as AI/ML based when in fact it is. And some companies\nmention that their technology is AI/ML based in the announce￾ment of the FDA approval or the specific ML method they used,\nbut others do not. We witnessed this issue while working on this\npaper ourselves.\nAt this moment, the evaluation of the processes for approval\nand implementation is hampered by a lack of clarity on the\napproval of AI/ML-based medical devices and algorithms, as FDA\nannouncements do not clearly state the use of these methods.\nMoreover, the search engine of the FDA’s website does not allow\nusers to perform specific search queries in FDA announcements\nand summaries, thus hampering the accessibility of the database.\nIt can be expected from regulatory bodies to provide a clear\ndescription of such devices; create and maintain a clear database,\nallowing proper search queries, to assess the implementation of\nnew techniques. The FDA, like other regulatory agencies, has not\ndone any of these yet.\nThe purpose of this paper therefore was threefold: (1) to\nprovide an insight into the currently available AI/ML-based\nmedical devices and algorithms that have been approved by the\nFDA; (2) to create an up-to-date database of FDA approvals in this\nfield that welcomes submissions and might serve as the database\nthat the FDA should have; and (3) to raise awareness of the\nimportance of regulatory bodies clearly stating whether a medical\ndevice is AI/ML based.\nIn line with this aim, we performed a systematic web-based\nsearch for announcements of FDA approvals of AI/ML-based\nmedical devices and algorithms and cross-checked all approvals\non FDA.gov resulting in an open access and continuously\nexpandable database.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive database of\nstrictly AI/ML-based medical technologies, in all medical special￾ties, that have been approved by the FDA. We also suggest a\nthreshold and definition of what defines a medical technology as\nAI/ML based.\nRESULTS\nCross-checked and validated medical devices and algorithms\nCross-checking and validation of all announcements resulted in a\ndatabase with 64 AI/ML based, FDA-approved medical devices\nand algorithms. We decided to include only those 29 devices in\nour further analysis that met the criteria of being considered an AI/\nML-based technology in the related official FDA announcements\n(Table 2). For the other 35 devices, online sources other than the\nFDA marked them as AI/ML-based technologies. A comprehensive\noverview is provided in the online open access database.\nA short overview of these medical devices and algorithms can\nbe found in the infographic (Fig. 1) and a detailed overview, with\nsubsequent directions to the official FDA announcements, is\nprovided in the online open access database.\nOf these medical devices and algorithms, the vast majority (n =\n23, 79.3%) was approved by the FDA with a 510(k) clearance, while\n5 (17.2%) received de novo pathway clearance and one (3.4%)\nreceived PMA clearance.\nThe first FDA approval was granted in the year 2016, with three\napprovals at the end of the year 2017. Most FDA approvals were\ngranted in the year 2018, with 13 (44.8%) approvals, while 10\n(34.4%) and 2 (6.9%) approvals were granted in 2019 and 2020 up\nuntil February, respectively.\nThe two main medical specialties with AI/ML-based medical\ninnovations are Radiology and Cardiology, with 21 (72.4%) and 4\n(13.8%) FDA approved medical devices and algorithms respec￾tively. The remaining medical devices and algorithms can be\ngrouped as focusing on internal medicine/endocrinology, neurol￾ogy, ophthalmology, emergency medicine, and oncology.\nThe medical field of radiology is the trendsetter regarding FDA￾approved medical devices and algorithms, with the introduction\nof AI/ML-based solutions for worldwide applied image reading\nsoftware. Examples are the three algorithms for Arterys Inc.,\nArterys Cardio DL, Arterys Oncology DL and Arterys MICA, which\nTable 1. Descriptions of the types of FDA approvals for AI/ML-based medical technologies.\nLevel of FDA clearance Description\n510(k) clearance A 510(k) clearance for an algorithm is granted when it has been shown to be at least as safe and effective as another similar,\nlegally marketed algorithm. The submitter seeking this clearance must provide substantial proof of equivalence in their\napplication. Without an approval of being substantially equivalent to the other algorithm, the one pending approval cannot\nbe legally marketed.\nPremarket approval Premarket approval is issued to algorithms for Class III medical devices. The latter are those that can have a large impact on\nhuman health and as such, their evaluation undergo more thorough scientific and regulatory processes to determine their\nsafety and effectiveness. In order to approve an application, the FDA determines that the device’s safety and effectiveness is\nsupported by satisfactory scientific evidence. Upon approval, the applicant can proceed with marketing the product.\nde novo pathway Regarding the de novo classification, it is used to classify those novel medical devices for which there are no legally\nmarketed counterparts, but which offer adequate safety and effectiveness with general controls. The FDA performs a risk￾based assessment of the device in question before approval and allowing the device to be marketed.\nS.

Six out of these 21\nalgorithms can be applied in the field of oncology, with three\nfocusing on mammography analyses (ProFound™ AI Software\nV2.1, cmTriage and TransparaTM) and three others on CT-based\nlesion detection (Arterys Oncology DL, Arterys MICA and QuantX).\nThis is followed by two algorithms focusing on brain image\nanalyses, with innovations for stroke and hemorrhage detection\n(ContaCT, Accipiolx, and icobrain), and six algorithms to improve\nimage processing, with noise and radiation dosage reduction\n(SubtlePET, Deep Learning Image Reconstruction, Advanced\nIntelligent Clear-IQ Engine, SubtleMR, AI-Rad Companion (Pul￾monary) and AI-Rad Companion (Cardiovascular)). Another four\nalgorithms focusing on acute care, with two algorithms for the\nassessment of pneumothorax (HealthPNX and Critical Care Suite),\none focusing on wrist fracture diagnosis (OsteoDetect) and the\nAidoc Medical BriefCase system for triage of head, spine, and chest\ninjuries. The final two algorithms in this specialty can be applied\nfor cardiovascular assessments, focusing on the assessment of the\nheart ejection fraction (EchoMD AEF Software and EchoGo Core).\nCardiology is another category with major advancements,\nresulting in four FDA-approved medical devices and algorithms.\nMost investment goes to innovations for the detection of cardiac\nrhythm abnormalities, with FDA approval for the AI-ECG Platform\nand Eko Analysis Software. The other two algorithms overlap with\nthe field of Radiology, being EchoMD AEF software and\nEchoGo Core.\nWith diabetes affecting a significant part of society, innovations\nto manage blood glucose levels were highly warranted. The first\nsteps were made with the introduction of the Guardian Connect\nSystem by Medtronic and the DreaMed Diabetes system (DreaMed\nDiabetes Ltd)21. AI/ML-based interpretation of laboratory results\nwas also introduced for the field of Internal Medicine, with the\nFerriSmart Analysis System (Resonance Health Analysis Service Pty\nLtd) for liver iron concentration assessment.\nTo increase access to early eye disease detection, one company\nintroduced an AI/ML-based algorithm for the interpretation of\nophthalmology tests, being Idx (IDx LLC) for detection of diabetic\nretinopathy22.\nThere are also some devices and algorithms related to\nneurology, with broad overlap with the field of Radiology. In\naddition to these overlapping algorithms, EnsoSleep was intro￾duced for the diagnosis of sleep disorders.\nAdditional medical devices and algorithms\nFor these 35 medical devices, the application of AI/ML has not\nbeen confirmed by the official FDA announcements but by other\nonline sources.\nWith the introduction of the BodyGuardian Remote Monitoring\nSystem from Preventice Solutions in 2012, the first FDA-approved\nAI/ML-based medical device was introduced23. This initiated\nfurther investments in innovations for the detection of cardiac\nrhythm abnormalities, resulting in 14 medical devices and\nalgorithms for this purpose. The other two algorithms in this field\nfocus on the detection of cardiac murmurs (eMurmer ID, CSD Labs\nGmbH). Interest from multinational technology companies is\nevident, with two FDA-approved algorithms from Apple Inc, being\nthe ECG App and Apple Irregular Rhythm Notification Feature.\nApplication of AI/ML-based algorithms for rapid interpretation\nof the most general values in medical care, being the vital signs,\nwas achieved by Excel Medical Electronics, Spry Health and\nCurrent Health. To further assist medical personnel in general,\nStratoscientific, Inc. introduced the Steth IO device to analyse\nheart and lung sounds.\nWith two AI/ML-based algorithms, BrainScope Company Inc. has\nintroduced AI/ML for the evaluation of brain injuries. At first, this\ncompany introduced Ahead 100, an electroencephalograph-based\nalgorithm to evaluate patients after a mild traumatic brain injury.\nThis algorithm was further developed, resulting in the introduction\nof BrainScope TBI, an algorithm which can be used for a broader\nscope of traumatic brain injuries—from functional abnormality\n(concussions) to structural injury (brain bleeds)24. Further attention\nFig. 1 An infographic about the 29 FDA-approved, AI/ML-based medical technologies.

Benjamens et al.\n5\nSeoul National University Bundang Hospital npj Digital Medicine (2020) 118 \n\ngoes to a gamified neurorehabilitation program, MindMotion GO\n(MindMaze SA), which is introduced to support rehabilitation for\nthe elderly25. Using motion capture technology and an AI/ML￾based algorithm, this invention promotes functional improve￾ments. Other areas of interest are the assessment of memory loss\nin the eldery (Cantab Mobile, Cambridge Cognition Ltd) and\nseizure monitoring (Embrace, Empatica Srl.)26,27.\nWith a high disease burden and a shortage of care providers,\nthe medical field of psychiatry is in need of AI/ML-based\nsupport28. Research efforts focus on the diagnosis and stratifica￾tion of psychological disorders, followed by subsequent treat￾ment support strategies. Two of these AI/ML-based algorithms\nreached the stage of FDA approval, QbCheck (QbTech AB) and\nReSET-O (Pear Therapeutics Inc.). With QbCheck, healthcare\nworkers can substantiate their diagnosis or rule out attention\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), enhancing objective\nmedical decisions in psychiatry29, whereas ReSET-O can be\napplied for patients with Opioid Use Disorder, providing cognitive\nbehavioral therapy as a mobile medical application for prescrip￾tion use only. As a next step, the ReSET-O algorithm will be used\nin a randomized controlled trial, which is scheduled to start this\nyear (April, 2020)30.\nDISCUSSION\nIn the beginning of the AI/ML era, it is especially important for the\nmedical and scientific community to have a clear understanding\nof what medical technologies are considered AI/ML based and\nwhich ones are regulated to see how those can become elements\nof the toolset of medical professionals. Our database shows that it\nis possible to define the threshold for categorizing a technology as\nAI/ML based and also, that there is a need from regulatory\nagencies to create their own databases.\nAuthors of this study hope that this database can serve as a\nbasis for the databases regulatory bodies will launch and the\ndefinition of threshold they will publish.\nThere are limitations to our approach. We aimed at determining\nthe state of AI/ML-based medical devices and were met with three\ninitial obstacles. (1) We chose to look only at regulated devices as\ncompanies tend to overhype the importance of their technology\nor simply use the terms AI and ML for the sake of more\ninvestments. (2) We chose to look at FDA approvals as the FDA has\nshown leadership in regulating AI/ML-based medical technologies\nand has published policies about that. And (3) we had to\ndetermine what should be considered as an AI/ML-based medical\ntechnology based on claims made in publicly available informa￾tion sources.\nWhile we aim to maintain the database along with contribu￾tions from the scientific community, the primary aim of the project\nis to encourage the FDA and other regulatory bodies to provide a\nclear overview of approved AI/ML-based medical devices and\nalgorithms.\nThese obstacles also describe the possible limitations of our\napproach. First, not all AI/ML-based medical devices have been\napproved by the FDA, therefore we had to exclude many\nunregulated technologies from the database. Second, there are\nnumerous AI/ML-based medical devices and algorithms in other\ncountries outside the scope and supervision of the FDA. And third,\nas the FDA does not maintain such a database, we had to set the\nthreshold for assessing what technology should be considered as\nAI based. It is possible that the terms and expressions we looked\nfor could be too narrow for assessing AI/ML-based technologies.\nWhile the scope of solving these issues exceeded our capacity,\nwe believe that this paper represents the results of a pioneering\nwork. No other curated database of FDA approvals of AI/ML-based\ndevices and algorithms that serve medical purposes exists. As\nsuch solutions become increasingly adapted in the healthcare\nsetting, the importance of such an easily accessible database will\nbecome more apparent.\nWhile we aim to maintain the database along with contribu￾tions from the scientific community, we encourage the FDA and\nother regulatory bodies to take over this database or launch their\nown. The EMA already provides guidelines and statements about\nAI and would benefit from the addition of such a repository. This\nwill help those local and international institutions and the public\nas the use of AI/ML-based medical technologies in healthcare has\nbecome imminent.\nThe FDA, which is the very source of these approvals, possesses\nthe necessary resources required to perform in-depth analysis\nregarding the credibility and accuracy of algorithms for medical\npurposes. Especially, having access to the background database of\ntheir search engine where the content of FDA approval summaries\nis available.\nAlso, regulatory bodies could establish a clearer definition of\nwhat falls under the terms AI and ML This would also make it\neasier for developers, companies, researchers, journalists, and the\ngeneral public to determine whether an approved technology is in\nfact AI/ML based.\nWe aimed at providing a method and a model for achieving\nthat.\nOn top of the rise in AI/ML-based algorithms, reports show a\ncomparable increase in the global market size for AI/ML in\nhealthcare. The value is projected to soon exceed US$28 billion\nfrom its 1 billion value in 201631. Software and devices using the\ntechnology will inevitably contribute to this market share.\nHowever, despite the increasingly available AI/ML-based\nmedical solutions on the market, there remains the factor of\nadopting those very solutions. The challenge to adopting these in\nthe medical practice can be attributed to hindrances due to\nregulatory frameworks and trust issues with new technologies\nfrom both the physicians and patients side32.\nThere needs to be a paradigm shift when implementing new\ntechnologies, including AI/ML-based ones, in the healthcare\nsystem and key regulators play a crucial role in this as stated in\nthe previous section.\nAccording to our findings, there were no AI/ML-based devices\napproved by the FDA in 2010 and 2011. In the year 2012, we\nidentified two while in 2019 alone, there were 22, amounting the\nnumber of relevant software programs to 64. In a decade, there\nwas a major increase in the amount of these technologies.\nAs new approvals of AI/ML-based medical technologies become\navailable, it will become even more difficult to keep track of all\nrelevant announcements. This open access database that we set\nup and will continuously maintain could help serve as a reference\nfor interested parties working on similar software or for research\npurposes; and as such will hopefully be a useful tool for the\nmedical and scientific community.\nMETHODS\nReasoning for not being able to do searches thoroughly\non fda.gov\nThe most obvious method for our research would have been to check the\nofficial FDA database on FDA.gov and look for AI/ML-related terms in the\nsummaries or approvals. The FDA’s official website does feature a search\nengine option, making all of its announcements freely accessible. However,\nsearches cannot be filtered according to their content such as approval\nannouncements or specific words. Looking for AI/ML-related terms in this\nway is not possible on the FDA’s search engine.\nThe FDA also provides reports of approvals in the 510(k), PMA and de\nnovo categories on a monthly basis, but these provide basic information\nabout the device or software approved and its company, with no mention\nof its function33.\nIn the next section, we outline the search strategy we chose to use that\nstill ensures that all items in the database are cross-checked but could also\nmean that the database might not be complete. While not ideal, this issue\nS. Benjamens et al.\n6\nnpj Digital Medicine (2020) 118 Seoul National University Bundang Hospital\n\nalso underscores the notion that the FDA’s website could improve its\nsearch function with a filter feature so as to provide more streamlined\nresults. Moreover, given that the database we built is open to submissions,\nwe hope to make it as complete and as comprehensive as possible.\nSearch strategy employed for the database\nFor our search, we used a search strategy with the following steps: first,\nreliable resources, where FDA announcements appear regularly, were\nselected; second, these resources were used to identify relevant\nannouncements; third, all identified announcements were cross-checked\nin the search engine of fda.gov.\nAnnouncements from the websites listed were prioritized, scrutinized for\nrelevant ones and then cross-checked on the FDA’s website for the official\napproval: mobihealthnews.com; bmj.com; medscape.com; lancet.com;\nsciencedaily.com; radiologybusiness.com; and acrdsi.org. In the announce￾ments, we had to focus on key words that would point to the use of AI/ML\nin a medically oriented device or software that has been approved by the\nFDA (Fig. 2).\nAs the FDA does not have a threshold for marking devices as AI/ML￾based, our observations showed that the most logical way to determine if\na software program or device can be considered as AI/ML based is if the\nofficial FDA announcement contains any of these expressions: “machine\nlearning”, “deep learning”, “deep neural networks”, “artificial intelligence”,\nand/or “AI.” Taking this into consideration, we used the following search\nstrategy: (“FDA approval” OR “FDA clearance” OR “Approved by the FDA”)\nAND “Machine learning” OR “Deep learning” OR “Deep neural networks”\nOR “artificial intelligence” OR “AI”).\nNevertheless, we found that not all announcements use these terms\neven if the underlying algorithm can be defined as AI/ML based. For\nexample, when looking for a specific device like AliveCor Inc.’s Kardia, the\nFDA announcement does not mention any of the expressions we looked\nfor, while the company elsewhere states that their device uses an AI/ML￾based algorithm34. We decided to include these devices and algorithms as\nwell, although we clearly marked in the database that the related FDA\nannouncements do not contain any of the expressions we looked for.\nInstead, we included those not FDA-related announcements with a URL\nthat did.\nWe performed search queries for the time period between the 1st of\nJanuary 2010 and the 1st of March 2020. As AI/ML-based technologies in\nmedicine started gaining attention in the mid-2010s, we chose a longer\ntime period to avoid missing important announcements. Once a relevant\nsoftware program or product was identified from one of those websites, its\nauthenticity was verified on fda.gov and recorded in our database with the\naccompanying FDA approval number.\nWe also extended our searches to other websites to ensure that we did\nnot miss any announcements, but the majority came from the above￾mentioned resources. Moreover, every single announcement recorded in\nour database was reviewed independently by the other authors of\nthis paper.\nOnline database and submission of new announcements\nFollowing our collective input, cross-checking and validations, we created\nan online database to aggregate the results under the URL https://\nmedicalfuturist.com/fda-approved-ai-based-algorithms/. This open access\ndatabase will be regularly updated by the authors as the FDA approves\nnew AI/ML-based devices and software.\nThe database includes the following details for each approval: name of\nthe device or algorithm; name of the company; short description; FDA\napproval number; type of FDA approval; mention of AI/ML in the\nannouncement, if no mention of AI/ML in FDA announcement (URL); date\nof approval; medical specialty it is related to; secondary medical specialty it\nis related to.\nDue to the nature of the search strategy we chose to use, it is possible\nthat we have missed some announcements. Therefore, we added a\nsubmission feature on the database, allowing the community to submit\nnew ones that have been released after our search concluded or even\nthose that we might have missed during our initial search. All community\nsubmissions will be cross-checked and verified before being considered to\nbe added to the database.\nThe infographic\nIn order to provide a clear picture about the state of AI/ML based, FDA￾approved medical devices and algorithms; demonstrate which medical\nspecialties those are related to, and how their number has been rising\nsince 2010, we put all the cross-checked and verified devices in an\ninfographic.\nThe infographic contains a device’s name, its short description, its\nrelation to a primary and a secondary medical specialty and what kind of\nFDA approval it received. The same colors are assigned to the same\nmedical specialty.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on experimental design is available in the Nature\nResearch Reporting Summary linked to this paper.\nDATA AVAILABILITY\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available on https://\nmedicalfuturist.com/fda-approved-ai-based-algorithms.\nReceived: 28 March 2020; Accepted: 13 August 2020;\nREFERENCES\n1.

Published in the Journal of Medical Systems in 2019. The article provides an overview of the current state of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications in medical diagnosis, with a particular focus on their accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The authors analyzed 49 articles published between 2011 and 2018, covering various medical domains such as dermatology, ophthalmology, cardiology, and radiology. The results showed that AI and ML algorithms achieved high performance in most medical tasks, with an average AUC of 0.95. However, the authors noted that the quality of the datasets used in the studies varied widely, ranging from small cohorts to large population-based datasets. Additionally, the authors highlighted the need for standardization and validation of AI and ML algorithms in medical diagnosis, as well as the importance of addressing issues related to data privacy, security, and explainability. Overall, the study suggests that AI and ML hold great promise for improving medical diagnosis, but further research is needed to ensure their reliability and clinical utility.\n\nLimitations:\n- The study focused mainly on retrospective studies, which may limit the generalizability of the results to prospective settings.\n- The authors did not analyze the cost-effectiveness of AI and ML algorithms in medical diagnosis, which is an important factor for their practical implementation.\n- The study did not address the potential social and ethical implications of AI and ML in medical diagnosis, such as job displacement and data ownership.\n- The authors did not compare the performance of AI and ML algorithms with traditional diagnostic methods, which would provide insights into their added value.\n\nImplications:\n- Future research should prioritize prospective studies to evaluate the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of AI and ML algorithms in medical diagnosis.\n- Standardization and validation protocols should be established for AI and ML algorithms to ensure their reliability and clinical utility.\n- Data privacy, security, and explainability concerns should be addressed to ensure patient trust and confidence in AI and ML algorithms.\n- Social and ethical implications of AI and ML algorithms in medical diagnosis should be explored to mitigate potential negative impacts.\n- Comparative studies between AI and ML algorithms and traditional diagnostic methods should be conducted to understand their added value."}
{"user_input": "Which technologies show the strongest publication/citation increases in the last five years indicating emerging interests/trends/consensus (outside of the expected like AI or by center or region)?", "retrieved_contexts": ["It has been claimed and demonstrated that many (and \npossibly most) of the conclusions drawn from biomedi￾cal research are probably false1\n. A central cause for this \nimportant problem is that researchers must publish in \norder to succeed, and publishing is a highly competitive \nenterprise, with certain kinds of findings more likely to \nbe published than others. Research that produces novel \nresults, statistically significant results (that is, typically \np<0.05) and seemingly ‘clean’ results is more likely to be \npublished2,3\n. As a consequence, researchers have strong \nincentives to engage in research practices that make \ntheir findings publishable quickly, even if those prac￾tices reduce the likelihood that the findings reflect a true \n(that is, non-null) effect4\n. Such practices include using \nflexible study designs and flexible statistical analyses \nand running small studies with low statistical power1,5\n. \nA simulation of genetic association studies showed \nthat a typical dataset would generate at least one false \npositive result almost 97% of the time6\n, and two efforts \nto replicate promising findings in biomedicine reveal \nreplication rates of 25% or less7,8\n. Given that these pub￾lishing biases are pervasive across scientific practice, it \nis possible that false positives heavily contaminate the \nneuroscience literature as well, and this problem may \naffect at least as much, if not even more so, the most \nprominent journals9,10.\nHere, we focus on one major aspect of the problem: \nlow statistical power. The relationship between study \npower and the veracity of the resulting finding is \nunder-appreciated. Low statistical power (because of \nlow sample size of studies, small effects or both) nega￾tively affects the likelihood that a nominally statistically \nsignificant finding actually reflects a true effect. We dis￾cuss the problems that arise when low-powered research \ndesigns are pervasive. In general, these problems can be \ndivided into two categories. The first concerns prob￾lems that are mathematically expected to arise even if \nthe research conducted is otherwise perfect: in other \nwords, when there are no biases that tend to create sta￾tistically significant (that is, ‘positive’) results that are \nspurious. The second category concerns problems that \nreflect biases that tend to co‑occur with studies of low \npower or that become worse in small, underpowered \nstudies. We next empirically show that statistical power \nis typically low in the field of neuroscience by using evi￾dence from a range of subfields within the neuroscience \nliterature. We illustrate that low statistical power is an \nendemic problem in neuroscience and discuss the impli￾cations of this for interpreting the results of individual \nstudies.\nLow power in the absence of other biases\nThree main problems contribute to producing unreliable \nfindings in studies with low power, even when all other \nresearch practices are ideal. They are: the low probability of \nfinding true effects; the low positive predictive value (PPV; \nsee BOX 1 for definitions of key statistical terms) when an \neffect is claimed; and an exaggerated estimate of the mag￾nitude of the effect when a true effect is discovered.

Here, we show that the average statistical power of \nstudies in the neurosciences is very low. The consequences of this include overestimates of \neffect size and low reproducibility of results. There are also ethical dimensions to this \nproblem, as unreliable research is inefficient and wasteful. Improving reproducibility in \nneuroscience is a key priority and requires attention to well-established but often ignored \nmethodological principles.\nANALYSIS\nNATURE REVIEWS | NEUROSCIENCE VOLUME 14 | MAY 2013 | 365\n© 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

That \nis, low-powered studies produce more false negatives \nthan high-powered studies. When studies in a given \nfield are designed with a power of 20%, it means that if \nthere are 100 genuine non-null effects to be discovered \nin that field, these studies are expected to discover only \n20 of them11.\nSecond, the lower the power of a study, the lower \nthe probability that an observed effect that passes the \nrequired threshold of claiming its discovery (that is, \nreaching nominal statistical significance, such as p<0.05) \nactually reflects a true effect1,12. This probability is called \nthe PPV of a claimed discovery. The formula linking the \nPPV to power is:\nwhere (1−β) is the power, β is the type II error, α is the \ntype I error and R is the pre-study odds (that is, the odds \nthat a probed effect is indeed non-null among the effects \nbeing probed). The formula is derived from a simple \ntwo-by-two table that tabulates the presence and non￾presence of a non-null effect against significant and \nnon-significant research findings1\n. The formula shows \nthat, for studies with a given pre-study odds R, the \nlower the power and the higher the type I error, the \nlower the PPV. And for studies with a given pre-study \nodds R and a given type I error (for example, the tra￾ditional p = 0.05 threshold), the lower the power, the \nlower the PPV.\nFor example, suppose that we work in a scientific field \nin which one in five of the effects we test are expected to \nbe truly non-null (that is, R=1/(5–1)=0.25) and that we \nclaim to have discovered an effect when we reach p<0.05; \nif our studies have 20% power, then PPV=0.20×0.25 /\n(0.20×0.25+0.05)=0.05/0.10=0.50; that is, only half of \nour claims for discoveries will be correct. If our studies \nhave 80% power, then PPV=0.80×0.25 /(0.80×0.25+\n0.05)=0.20 / 0.25=0.80; that is, 80% of our claims for \ndiscoveries will be correct. \nThird, even when an underpowered study discovers a \ntrue effect, it is likely that the estimate of the magnitude \nof that effect provided by that study will be exaggerated. \nThis effect inflation is often referred to as the ‘winner’s \ncurse’13 and is likely to occur whenever claims of discov￾ery are based on thresholds of statistical significance (for \nexample, p<0.05) or other selection filters (for example, \na Bayes factor better than a given value or a false-discov￾ery rate below a given value). Effect inflation is worst for \nsmall, low-powered studies, which can only detect effects \nthat happen to be large. If, for example, the true effect is \nmedium-sized, only those small studies that, by chance, \noverestimate the magnitude of the effect will pass the \nthreshold for discovery. To illustrate the winner’s curse, \nsuppose that an association truly exists with an effect size \nthat is equivalent to an odds ratio of 1.20, and we are try￾ing to discover it by performing a small (that is, under￾powered) study. Suppose also that our study only has the \npower to detect an odds ratio of 1.20 on average 20% of \nthe time. The results of any study are subject to sampling \nvariation and random error in the measurements of the \nvariables and outcomes of interest. Therefore, on aver￾age, our small study will find an odds ratio of 1.20 but, \nbecause of random errors, our study may in fact find an \nodds ratio smaller than 1.20 (for example, 1.00) or an odds \nratio larger than 1.20 (for example, 1.60). Odds ratios of \n1.00 or 1.20 will not reach statistical significance because \nof the small sample size. We can only claim the association \nas nominally significant in the third case, where random \nBox 1 | Key statistical terms\nCAMARADES\nThe Collaborative Approach to Meta-Analysis and Review of Animal Data from \nExperimental Studies (CAMARADES) is a collaboration that aims to reduce bias and \nimprove the quality of methods and reporting in animal research. To this end, \nCAMARADES provides a resource for data sharing, aims to provide a web-based \nstratified meta-analysis bioinformatics engine and acts as a repository for completed \nreviews.\nEffect size\nAn effect size is a standardized measure that quantifies the size of the difference \nbetween two groups or the strength of an association between two variables. As \nstandardized measures, effect sizes allow estimates from different studies to be \ncompared directly and also to be combined in meta-analyses.\nExcess significance\nExcess significance is the phenomenon whereby the published literature has an \nexcess of statistically significant results that are due to biases in reporting.\nSeveral mechanisms contribute to reporting bias, including study publication bias, \nwhere the results of statistically non-significant (‘negative’) studies are left \nunpublished; selective outcome reporting bias, where null results are omitted; and \nselective analysis bias, where data are analysed with different methods that favour \n‘positive’ results.\nFixed and random effects\nA fixed-effect meta-analysis assumes that the underlying effect is the same (that is, \nfixed) in all studies and that any variation is due to sampling errors. By contrast, a \nrandom-effect meta-analysis does not require this assumption and allows for \nheterogeneity between studies. A test of heterogeneity in between-study effects is \noften used to test the fixed-effect assumption.\nMeta-analysis\nMeta-analysis refers to statistical methods for contrasting and combining results from \ndifferent studies to provide more powerful estimates of the true effect size as opposed \nto a less precise effect size derived from a single study.\nPositive predictive value\nThe positive predictive value (PPV) is the probability that a ‘positive’ research finding \nreflects a true effect (that is, the finding is a true positive). This probability of a research \nfinding reflecting a true effect depends on the prior probability of it being true (before \ndoing the study), the statistical power of the study and the level of statistical \nsignificance.\nProteus phenomenon\nThe Proteus phenomenon refers to the situation in which the first published study is \noften the most biased towards an extreme result (the winner’s curse). Subsequent \nreplication studies tend to be less biased towards the extreme, often finding evidence \nof smaller effects or even contradicting the findings from the initial study.\nStatistical power\nThe statistical power of a test is the probability that it will correctly reject the null \nhypothesis when the null hypothesis is false (that is, the probability of not committing a \ntype II error or making a false negative decision). The probability of committing a type II \nerror is referred to as the false negative rate (β), and power is equal to 1 – β.\nWinner’s curse\nThe winner’s curse refers to the phenomenon whereby the ‘lucky’ scientist who makes a \ndiscovery is cursed by finding an inflated estimate of that effect. The winner’s curse \noccurs when thresholds, such as statistical significance, are used to determine the \npresence of an effect and is most severe when thresholds are stringent and studies are \ntoo small and thus have low power.\nNature Reviews |\nPPV = ([1 – β] × R) ⁄ ([1− β] × R + α)\nANALYSIS\n366 | MAY 2013 | VOLUME 14 www.nature.com/reviews/neuro\n© 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The winner’s curse \nmeans, therefore, that the ‘lucky’ scientist who makes \nthe discovery in a small study is cursed by finding an \ninflated effect.\nThe winner’s curse can also affect the design and con￾clusions of replication studies. If the original estimate of \nthe effect is inflated (for example, an odds ratio of 1.60), \nthen replication studies will tend to show smaller effect \nsizes (for example, 1.20), as findings converge on the \ntrue effect. By performing more replication studies, we \nshould eventually arrive at the more accurate odds ratio \nof 1.20, but this may take time or may never happen if we \nonly perform small studies. A common misconception \nis that a replication study will have sufficient power to \nreplicate an initial finding if the sample size is similar to \nthat in the original study14. However, a study that tries \nto replicate a significant effect that only barely achieved \nnominal statistical significance (that is, p~0.05) and that \nuses the same sample size as the original study, will only \nachieve ~50% power, even if the original study accurately \nestimated the true effect size. This is illustrated in FIG. 1. \nMany published studies only barely achieve nominal sta￾tistical significance15. This means that if researchers in a \nparticular field determine their sample sizes by historical \nprecedent rather than through formal power calculation, \nthis will place an upper limit on average power within \nthat field. As the true effect size is likely to be smaller \nthan that indicated by the initial study — for example, \nbecause of the winner’s curse — the actual power is likely \nto be much lower. Furthermore, even if power calcula￾tion is used to estimate the sample size that is necessary \nin a replication study, these calculations will be overly \noptimistic if they are based on estimates of the true \neffect size that are inflated owing to the winner’s curse \nphenomenon. This will further hamper the replication \nprocess.\nLow power in the presence of other biases\nLow power is associated with several additional biases. \nFirst, low-powered studies are more likely to pro￾vide a wide range of estimates of the magnitude of an \neffect (which is known as ‘vibration of effects’ and is \ndescribed below). Second, publication bias, selective \ndata analysis and selective reporting of outcomes are \nmore likely to affect low-powered studies. Third, small \nstudies may be of lower quality in other aspects of their \ndesign as well. These factors can further exacerbate the \nlow reliability of evidence obtained in studies with low \nstatistical power.\nVibration of effects13 refers to the situation in which \na study obtains different estimates of the magnitude of \nthe effect depending on the analytical options it imple￾ments. These options could include the statistical model, \nthe definition of the variables of interest, the use (or not) \nof adjustments for certain potential confounders but not \nothers, the use of filters to include or exclude specific \nobservations and so on. For example, a recent analysis \nof 241 functional MRI (fMRI) studies showed that 223 \nunique analysis strategies were observed so that almost \nno strategy occurred more than once16. Results can vary \nmarkedly depending on the analysis strategy1\n. This is \nmore often the case for small studies — here, results can \nchange easily as a result of even minor analytical manipu￾lations. In small studies, the range of results that can be \nobtained owing to vibration of effects is wider than in \nlarger studies, because the results are more uncertain and \ntherefore fluctuate more in response to analytical changes. \nImagine, for example, dropping three observations from \nthe analysis of a study of 12 samples because post-hoc \nthey are considered unsatisfactory; this manipulation \nmay not even be mentioned in the published paper, which \nFigure 1 | Statistical power of a replication study. a | If \na study finds evidence for an effect at p=0.05, then the \ndifference between the mean of the null distribution \n(indicated by the solid blue curve) and the mean of the \nobserved distribution (dashed blue curve) is 1.96×sem. \nb | Studies attempting to replicate an effect using the \nsame sample size as that of the original study would have \nroughly the same sampling variation (that is, sem) as in the \noriginal study. Assuming, as one might in a power \ncalculation, that the initially observed effect we are trying \nto replicate reflects the true effect, the potential \ndistribution of these replication effect estimates would be \nsimilar to the distribution of the original study (dashed \ngreen curve). A study attempting to replicate a nominally \nsignificant effect (p~0.05), which uses the same sample \nsize as the original study, would therefore have (on \naverage) a 50% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis \n(indicated by the coloured area under the green curve) and \nthus only 50% statistical power. c | We can increase the \npower of the replication study (coloured area under the \norange curve) by increasing the sample size so as to reduce \nthe sem. Powering a replication study adequately (that is, \nachieving a power ≥80%) therefore often requires a larger \nsample size than the original study, and a power \ncalculation will help to decide the required size of the \nreplication sample.\nANALYSIS\nNATURE REVIEWS | NEUROSCIENCE VOLUME 14 | MAY 2013 | 367\n© 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

When investigators select the most favourable, \ninteresting, significant or promising results among a wide \nspectrum of estimates of effect magnitudes, this is inevi￾tably a biased choice.\nPublication bias and selective reporting of outcomes \nand analyses are also more likely to affect smaller, under￾powered studies17. Indeed, investigations into publication \nbias often examine whether small studies yield different \nresults than larger ones18. Smaller studies more readily \ndisappear into a file drawer than very large studies that \nare widely known and visible, and the results of which are \neagerly anticipated (although this correlation is far from \nperfect). A ‘negative’ result in a high-powered study can￾not be explained away as being due to low power19,20, and \nthus reviewers and editors may be more willing to pub￾lish it, whereas they more easily reject a small ‘negative’ \nstudy as being inconclusive or uninformative21. The pro￾tocols of large studies are also more likely to have been \nregistered or otherwise made publicly available, so that \ndeviations in the analysis plans and choice of outcomes \nmay become obvious more easily. Small studies, con￾versely, are often subject to a higher level of exploration \nof their results and selective reporting thereof.\nThird, smaller studies may have a worse design quality \nthan larger studies. Several small studies may be oppor￾tunistic experiments, or the data collection and analysis \nmay have been conducted with little planning. Conversely, \nlarge studies often require more funding and personnel \nresources. As a consequence, designs are examined more \ncarefully before data collection, and analysis and reporting \nmay be more structured. This relationship is not absolute \n— small studies are not always of low quality. Indeed, a \nbias in favour of small studies may occur if the small stud￾ies are meticulously designed and collect high-quality data \n(and therefore are forced to be small) and if large studies \nignore or drop quality checks in an effort to include as \nlarge a sample as possible.\nEmpirical evidence from neuroscience\nAny attempt to establish the average statistical power in \nneuroscience is hampered by the problem that the true \neffect sizes are not known. One solution to this problem \nis to use data from meta-analyses. Meta-analysis pro￾vides the best estimate of the true effect size, albeit with \nlimitations, including the limitation that the individual \nstudies that contribute to a meta-analysis are themselves \nsubject to the problems described above. If anything, \nsummary effects from meta-analyses, including power \nestimates calculated from meta-analysis results, may also \nbe modestly inflated22.\nAcknowledging this caveat, in order to estimate sta￾tistical power in neuroscience, we examined neurosci￾ence meta-analyses published in 2011 that were retrieved \nusing ‘neuroscience’ and ‘meta-analysis’ as search terms. \nUsing the reported summary effects of the meta-analy￾ses as the estimate of the true effects, we calculated the \npower of each individual study to detect the effect indi￾cated by the corresponding meta-analysis.\nMethods. Included in our analysis were articles published \nin 2011 that described at least one meta-analysis of previ￾ously published studies in neuroscience with a summary \neffect estimate (mean difference or odds/risk ratio) as well \nas study level data on group sample size and, for odds/risk \nratios, the number of events in the control group.\nWe searched computerized databases on 2 February \n2012 via Web of Science for articles published in 2011, \nusing the key words ‘neuroscience’ and ‘meta-analysis’. \nAll of the articles that were identified via this electronic \nsearch were screened independently for suitability by two \nauthors (K.S.B. and M.R.M.). Articles were excluded if no \nabstract was electronically available (for example, confer￾ence proceedings and commentaries) or if both authors \nagreed, on the basis of the abstract, that a meta-analysis \nhad not been conducted. Full texts were obtained for the \nremaining articles and again independently assessed for \neligibility by two authors (K.S.B. and M.R.M.) (FIG. 2).\nFigure 2 | Flow diagram of articles selected for inclusion. Computerized \ndatabases were searched on 2 February 2012 via Web of Science for papers published in \n2011, using the key words ‘neuroscience’ and ‘meta-analysis’.

Data extraction was performed \nindependently by K.S.B. and M.R.M. or C.M. and verified collaboratively. In total, n=48 \narticles were included in the analysis.\nANALYSIS\n368 | MAY 2013 | VOLUME 14 www.nature.com/reviews/neuro\n© 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In those \ncases, we included multiple meta-analyses only if they \ncontained distinct study samples. If several meta-analyses \nhad overlapping study samples, we selected the most com￾prehensive (that is, the one containing the most studies) \nor, if the number of studies was equal, the first analysis \npresented in the article. Data extraction was indepen￾dently performed by K.S.B. and either M.R.M. or C.M. \nand verified collaboratively.\nThe following data were extracted for each meta￾analysis: first author and summary effect size estimate \nof the meta-analysis; and first author, publication year, \nsample size (by groups), number of events in the control \ngroup (for odds/risk ratios) and nominal significance \n(p<0.05, ‘yes/no’) of the contributing studies. For five \narticles, nominal study significance was unavailable and \nwas therefore obtained from the original studies if they \nwere electronically available. Studies with missing data \n(for example, due to unclear reporting) were excluded \nfrom the analysis.\nThe main outcome measure of our analysis was the \nachieved power of each individual study to detect the \nestimated summary effect reported in the corresponding \nmeta-analysis to which it contributed, assuming an α level \nof 5%. Power was calculated using G*Power software23. \nWe then calculated the mean and median statistical \npower across all studies.\nResults. Our search strategy identified 246 articles pub￾lished in 2011, out of which 155 were excluded after \nan initial screening of either the abstract or the full \ntext. Of the remaining 91 articles, 48 were eligible for \ninclusion in our analysis24–71, comprising data from 49 \nmeta-analyses and 730 individual primary studies. A \nflow chart of the article selection process is shown in \nFIG. 2, and the characteristics of included meta-analyses \nare described in TABLE 1.\nOur results indicate that the median statistical power \nin neuroscience is 21%. We also applied a test for an \nexcess of statistical significance72. This test has recently \nbeen used to show that there is an excess significance bias \nin the literature of various fields, including in studies of \nbrain volume abnormalities73, Alzheimer’s disease genet￾ics70,74 and cancer biomarkers75. The test revealed that the \nactual number (349) of nominally significant studies in \nour analysis was significantly higher than the number \nexpected (254; p<0.0001). Importantly, these calcula￾tions assume that the summary effect size reported in each \nstudy is close to the true effect size, but it is likely that \nthey are inflated owing to publication and other biases \ndescribed above.\nInterestingly, across the 49 meta-analyses included \nin our analysis, the average power demonstrated a clear \nbimodal distribution (FIG. 3). Most meta-analyses com￾prised studies with very low average power — almost \n50% of studies had an average power lower than 20%. \nHowever, seven meta-analyses comprised studies with \nhigh (>90%) average power24,26,31,57,63,68,71. These seven \nmeta-analyses were all broadly neurological in focus \nand were based on relatively small contributing studies \n— four out of the seven meta-analyses did not include \nany study with over 80 participants. If we exclude these \n‘outlying’ meta-analyses, the median statistical power \nfalls to 18%.\nSmall sample sizes are appropriate if the true effects \nbeing estimated are genuinely large enough to be reliably \nobserved in such samples. However, as small studies are \nparticularly susceptible to inflated effect size estimates and \npublication bias, it is difficult to be confident in the evi￾dence for a large effect if small studies are the sole source \nof that evidence. Moreover, many meta-analyses show \nsmall-study effects on asymmetry tests (that is, smaller \nstudies have larger effect sizes than larger ones) but never￾theless use random-effect calculations, and this is known \nto inflate the estimate of summary effects (and thus also \nthe power estimates). Therefore, our power calculations \nare likely to be extremely optimistic76.\nEmpirical evidence from specific fields\nOne limitation of our analysis is the under-representation \nof meta-analyses in particular subfields of neuroscience, \nsuch as research using neuroimaging and animal mod￾els. We therefore sought additional representative meta￾analyses from these fields outside our 2011 sampling frame \nto determine whether a similar pattern of low statistical \npower would be observed.\nNeuroimaging studies. Most structural and volumetric \nMRI studies are very small and have minimal power \nto detect differences between compared groups (for \nexample, healthy people versus those with mental health \ndiseases). A cl ear excess significance bias has been dem￾onstrated in studies of brain volume abnormalities73, \nand similar problems appear to exist in fMRI studies \nof the blood-oxygen-level-dependent response77. In \norder to establish the average statistical power of stud￾ies of brain volume abnormalities, we applied the same \nanalysis as described above to data that had been pre￾viously extracted to assess the presence of an excess of \nsignificance bias73. Our results indicated that the median \nstatistical power of these studies was 8% across 461 indi￾vidual studies contributing to 41 separate meta-analyses, \nwhich were drawn from eight articles that were published \nbetween 2006 and 2009. Full methodological details \ndescribing how studies were identified and selected are \navailable elsewhere73.\nAnimal model studies. Previous analyses of studies using \nanimal models have shown that small studies consist￾ently give more favourable (that is, ‘positive’) results than \nlarger studies78 and that study quality is inversely related \nto effect size79–82.

Our results \nindicate that the median statistical power for the water \nmaze studies and the radial maze studies to detect these \nmedium to large effects was 18% and 31%, respectively \n(TABLE 2). The average sample size in these studies was 22 \nanimals for the water maze and 24 for the radial maze \nexperiments. Studies of this size can only detect very \nlarge effects (d=1.20 for n=22, and d=1.26 for n=24) \nwith 80% power — far larger than those indicated by \nthe meta-analyses. These animal model studies were \ntherefore severely underpowered to detect the summary \neffects indicated by the meta-analyses. Furthermore, the \nsummary effects are likely to be inflated estimates of the \ntrue effects, given the problems associated with small \nstudies described above.\nThe results described in this section are based on \nonly two meta-analyses, and we should be appropriately \ncautious in extrapolating from this limited evidence. \nNevertheless, it is notable that the results are so con￾sistent with those observed in other fields, such as the \nneuroimaging and neuroscience studies that we have \ndescribed above.\nImplications\nImplications for the likelihood that a research finding \nreflects a true effect. Our results indicate that the aver￾age statistical power of studies in the field of neurosci￾ence is probably no more than between ~8% and ~31%, \non the basis of evidence from diverse subfields within \nneuro-science. If the low average power we observed \nacross these studies is typical of the neuroscience lit￾erature as a whole, this has profound implications for \nthe field. A major implication is that the likelihood that \nany nominally significant finding actually reflects a true \neffect is small. As explained above, the probability that \na research finding reflects a true effect (PPV) decreases \nas statistical power decreases for any given pre-study \nodds (R) and a fixed type I error level. It is easy to show \nthe impact that this is likely to have on the reliability of \nfindings. FIGURE 4 shows how the PPV changes for a range \nof values for R and for a range of v alues for the average \npower in a field. For effects that are genuinely non-null, \nFIG. 5 shows the degree to which an effect size estimate \nis likely to be inflated in initial studies — owing to the \nwinner’s curse phenomenon — for a range of values for \nstatistical power.\n The estimates shown in FIGS 4,5 are likely to be opti￾mistic, however, because they assume that statistical \npower and R are the only considerations in determin￾ing the probability that a research finding reflects a true \neffect. As we have already discussed, several other biases \nare also likely to reduce the probability that a research \nfinding reflects a true effect. Moreover, the summary \neffect size estimates that we used to determine the statis￾tical power of individual studies are themselves likely to \nbe inflated owing to bias — our excess of significance test \nprovided clear evidence for this. Therefore, the average \nstatistical power of studies in our analysis may in fact be \neven lower than the 8–31% range we observed.\nEthical implications. Low average power in neuro￾science studies also has ethical implications. In our \nanalysis of animal model studies, the average sample \nsize of 22 animals for the water maze experiments was \nonly sufficient to detect an effect size of d = 1.26 with \nTable 1 (cont.) | Characteristics of included meta-analyses\nStudy k N Summary effect size Power Refs\nMedian (range) Cohen’s d OR Random or \nfixed effects\nMedian \n(range)\nYang 3 51 (18–205) 0.67 NA 0.65 (0.27–1.00) 67\nYuan 14 116.5 (19–1178) 4.98 Fixed 0.92 (0.33–1.00) 68\nZafar 8 78.5 (46–483) 1.07* Random 0.05 (0.00–0.06) 69\nZhang 12 337.5 (39–901) 1.27 Random 0.14 (0.01–0.30) 70\nZhu 8 110 (48–371) 0.84 Random 0.97 (0.81–1.00) 71\nThe choice of fixed or random effects model was made by the original authors of the meta-analysis. k,number of studies; NA, not \navailable; OR, odds ratio. * indicates the relative risk.\nFigure 3 | Median power of studies included in \nneuroscience meta-analyses.

In order to achieve 80% \npower to detect, in a single study, the most probable true \neffects as indicated by the meta-analysis, a sample size \nof 134 animals would be required for the water maze \nexperiment (assuming an effect size of d = 0.49) and \n68 animals for the radial maze experiment (assuming \nan effect size of d=0.69); to achieve 95% power, these \nsample sizes would need to increase to 220 and 112, \nrespectively. What is particularly striking, however, is \nthe inefficiency of a continued reliance on small sample \nsizes. Despite the apparently large numbers of animals \nrequired to achieve acceptable statistical power in these \nexperiments, the total numbers of animals actually used \nin the studies contributing to the meta-analyses were \neven larger: 420 for the water maze experiments and \n514 for the radial maze experiments.\nThere is ongoing debate regarding the appropriate \nbalance to strike between using as few animals as possi￾ble in experiments and the need to obtain robust, reliable \nfindings. We argue that it is important to appreciate the \nwaste associated with an underpowered study — even a \nstudy that achieves only 80% power still presents a 20% \npossibility that the animals have been sacrificed with￾out the study detecting the underlying true effect. If the \naverage power in neuroscience animal model studies is \nbetween 20–30%, as we observed in our analysis above, \nthe ethical implications are clear.\nLow power therefore has an ethical dimension — \nunreliable research is inefficient and wasteful. This applies \nto both human and animal research. The principles of the \n‘three Rs’ in animal research (reduce, refine and replace)83\nrequire appropriate experimental design and statistics \n— both too many and too few animals present an issue \nas they reduce the value of research outputs. A require￾ment for sample size and power calculation is included \nin the Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments \n(ARRIVE) guidelines84, but such calculations require a \nclear appreciation of the expected magnitude of effects \nbeing sought.\nOf course, it is also wasteful to continue data col￾lection once it is clear that the effect being sought does \nnot exist or is too small to be of interest. That is, studies \nare not just wasteful when they stop too early, they are \nalso wasteful when they stop too late. Planned, sequen￾tial analyses are sometimes used in large clinical trials \nwhen there is considerable expense or potential harm \nassociated with testing participants. Clinical trials may \nbe stopped prematurely in the case of serious adverse \neffects, clear beneficial effects (in which case it would be \nunethical to continue to allocate participants to a placebo \ncondition) or if the interim effects are so unimpressive \nthat any prospect of a positive result with the planned \nsample size is extremely unlikely85. Within a significance \ntesting framework, such interim analyses — and the pro￾tocol for stopping — must be planned for the assump￾tions of significance testing to hold. Concerns have been \nraised as to whether stopping trials early is ever justified \ngiven the tendency for such a practice to produce inflated \neffect size estimates86. Furthermore, the decision process \naround stopping is not often fully disclosed, increasing \nthe scope for researcher degrees of freedom86. Alternative \napproaches exist. For example, within a Bayesian frame￾work, one can monitor the Bayes factor and simply stop \ntesting when the evidence is conclusive or when resources \nFigure 4 | Positive predictive value as a function of the \npre-study odds of association for different levels of \nstatistical power. The probability that a research finding \nreflects a true effect — also known as the positive \npredictive value (PPV) — depends on both the pre-study \nodds of the effect being true (the ratio R of ‘true effects’ \nover ‘null effects’ in the scientific field) and the study’s \nstatistical power. The PPV can be calculated for given \nvalues of statistical power (1 – β), pre-study odds ratio (R) \nand type I error rate (α), using the formula PPV=([1 – β]×R) \n⁄ ([1− β]×R+α). The median statistical power of studies in \nthe neuroscience field is optimistically estimated to be \nbetween ~8% and ~31%. The figure illustrates how low \nstatistical power consistent with this estimated range \n(that is, between 10% and 30%) detrimentally affects the \nassociation between the probability that a finding reflects \na true effect (PPV) and pre-study odds, assuming α=0.05. \nCompared with conditions of appropriate statistical \npower (that is, 80%), the probability that a research finding \nreflects a true effect is greatly reduced for 10% and 30% \npower, especially if pre-study odds are low. Notably, in an \nexploratory research field such as much of neuroscience, \nthe pre-study odds are often low.\nTable 2 | Sample size required to detect sex differences in water maze and radial maze performance\nTotal animals \nused\nRequired N per study Typical N per study Detectable effect for typical N\n80% power 95% power Mean Median 80% power 95% power\nWater maze 420 134 220 22 20 d=1.26 d=1.62\nRadial maze 514 68 112 24 20 d=1.20 d=1.54\nMeta-analysis indicated an effect size of Cohen’s d=0.49 for water maze studies and d=0.69 for radial maze studies.\nANALYSIS\n372 | MAY 2013 | VOLUME 14 www.nature.com/reviews/neuro\n© 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Similarly, adopting conservative priors \ncan substantially reduce the likelihood of claiming that \nan effect exists when in fact it does not85. At present, \nsignificance testing remains the dominant framework \nwithin neuroscience, but the flexibility of alternative (for \nexample, Bayesian) approaches means that they should \nbe taken seriously by the field.\nConclusions and future directions\nA consequence of the remarkable growth in neurosci￾ence over the past 50 years has been that the effects we \nnow seek in our experiments are often smaller and more \nsubtle than before as opposed to when mostly easily dis￾cernible ‘low-hanging fruit’ were targeted. At the same \ntime, computational analysis of very large datasets is now \nrelatively straightforward, so that an enormous number of \ntests can be run in a short time on the same dataset. These \ndramatic advances in the flexibility of research design and \nanalysis have occurred without accompanying changes to \nother aspects of research design, particularly power. For \nexample, the average sample size has not changed sub￾stantially over time88 despite the fact that neuroscientists \nare likely to be pursuing smaller effects. The increase in \nresearch flexibility and the complexity of study designs89\ncombined with the stability of sample size and search for \nincreasingly subtle effects has a disquieting consequence: \na dramatic increase in the likelihood that statistically sig￾nificant findings are spurious. This may be at the root of \nthe recent replication failures in the preclinical literature8\nand the correspondingly poor translation of these findings \ninto humans90.\nLow power is a problem in practice because of the \nnormative publishing standards for producing novel, \nsignificant, clean results and the ubiquity of null \nhypothesis significance testing as the means of evaluat￾ing the truth of research findings. As we have shown, \nthese factors result in biases that are exacerbated by low \npower. Ultimately, these biases reduce the reproducibil￾ity of neuroscience findings and negatively affect the \nvalidity of the accumulated findings. Unfortunately, \npublishing and reporting practices are unlikely to \nchange rapidly. Nonetheless, existing scientific practices \ncan be improved with small changes or additions that \napproximate key features of the idealized model4,91,92. \nWe provide a summary of recommendations for future \nresearch practice in BOX 2.\nIncreasing disclosure. False positives occur more fre￾quently and go unnoticed when degrees of freedom in \ndata analysis and reporting are undisclosed5\n. Researchers \ncan improve confidence in published reports by noting \nin the text: “We report how we determined our sample \nsize, all data exclusions, all data manipulations, and all \nmeasures in the study.”7\n When such a statement is not \npossible, disclosure of the rationale and justification of \ndeviations from what should be common practice (that \nis, reporting sample size, data exclusions, manipula￾tions and measures) will improve readers’ understand￾ing and interpretation of the reported effects and, \ntherefore, of what level of confidence in the reported \neffects is appropriate. In clinical trials, there is an \nincreasing requirement to adhere to the Consolidated \nStandards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT), and the \nsame is true for systematic reviews and meta-analyses, \nfor which the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic \nReviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines are \nnow being adopted. A number of reporting guidelines \nhave been produced for application to diverse study \ndesigns and tools, and an updated list is maintained \nby the EQUATOR Network93. A ten-item checklist of \nstudy quality has been developed by the Collaborative \nApproach to Meta-Analysis and Review of Animal Data \nin Experimental Stroke (CAMARADES), but to the best \nof our knowledge, this checklist is not yet widely used in \nprimary studies.\nFigure 5 | The winner’s curse: effect size inflation as \na function of statistical power. The winner’s curse \nrefers to the phenomenon that studies that find evidence \nof an effect often provide inflated estimates of the size of \nthat effect. Such inflation is expected when an effect has \nto pass a certain threshold — such as reaching statistical \nsignificance — in order for it to have been ‘discovered’. \nEffect inflation is worst for small, low-powered studies, \nwhich can only detect effects that happen to be large. If, \nfor example, the true effect is medium-sized, only those \nsmall studies that, by chance, estimate the effect to be \nlarge will pass the threshold for discovery (that is, the \nthreshold for statistical significance, which is typically \nset at p<0.05). In practice, this means that research \nfindings of small studies are biased in favour of inflated \neffects. By contrast, large, high-powered studies can \nreadily detect both small and large effects and so are less \nbiased, as both over- and underestimations of the true \neffect size will pass the threshold for ‘discovery’. We \noptimistically estimate the median statistical power of \nstudies in the neuroscience field to be between ~8% and \n~31%. The figure shows simulations of the winner’s curse \n(expressed on the y‑axis as relative bias of research \nfindings). These simulations suggest that initial effect \nestimates from studies powered between ~ 8% and ~31% \nare likely to be inflated by 25% to 50% (shown by the \narrows in the figure). Inflated effect estimates make it \ndifficult to determine an adequate sample size for \nreplication studies, increasing the probability of type II \nerrors.

However, presenting the result of an \nexploratory analysis as if it arose from a confirmatory \ntest inflates the chance that the result is a false positive. \nIn particular, p‑values lose their diagnostic value if they \nare not the result of a pre-specified analysis plan for \nwhich all results are reported. Pre-registration — and, \nultimately, full reporting of analysis plans — clarifies \nthe distinction between confirmatory and explora￾tory analysis, encourages well-powered studies (at least \nin the case of confirmatory analyses) and reduces the \nfile-drawer effect. These subsequently reduce the likeli￾hood of false positive accumulation. The Open Science \nFramework (OSF) offers a registration mechanism for \nscientific research. For observational studies, it would \nbe useful to register datasets in detail, so that one can be \naware of how extensive the multiplicity and complexity \nof analyses can be94.\nImproving availability of materials and data. Making \nresearch materials available will improve the quality \nof studies aimed at replicating and extending research \nfindings. Making raw data available will improve data \naggregation methods and confidence in reported \nresults. There are multiple repositories for making data \nmore widely available, such as The Dataverse Network \nProject and Dryad) for data in general and others \nsuch as OpenfMRI, INDI and OASIS for neuroimag￾ing data in particular. Also, commercial repositories \n(for example, figshare) offer means for sharing data \nand other research materials. Finally, the OSF offers \ninfrastructure for documenting, archiving and sharing \ndata within collaborative teams and also making some \nor all of those research materials publicly available. \nLeading journals are increasingly adopting policies for \nmaking data, protocols and analytical codes available, \nat least for some types of studies. However, these poli￾cies are uncommonly adhered to95, and thus the ability \nfor independent experts to repeat published analysis \nremains low96.\nIncentivizing replication. Weak incentives for conduct￾ing and publishing replications are a threat to identifying \nfalse positives and accumulating precise estimates of \nresearch findings. There are many ways to alter repli￾cation incentives97. For example, journals could offer a \nsubmission option for registered replications of impor￾tant research results (see, for example, a possible new \nsubmission format for Cortex98). Groups of researchers \ncan also collaborate on performing one or many replica￾tions to increase the total sample size (and therefore the \nstatistical power) achieved while minimizing the labour \nand resource impact on any one contributor. Adoption \nof the gold standard of large-scale collaborative con￾sortia and extensive replication in fields such as human \ngenome epidemiology has transformed the reliability \nof the produced findings. Although previously almost \nall of the proposed candidate gene associations from \nsmall studies were false99 (with some exceptions100), col￾laborative consortia have substantially improved power, \nand the replicated results can be considered highly reli￾able. In another example, in the field of psychology, the \nReproducibility Project is a collaboration of more than \n100 researchers aiming to estimate the reproducibility \nof psychological science by replicating a large sample of \nstudies published in 2008 in three psychology journals92. \nEach individual research study contributes just a small \nportion of time and effort, but the combined effect is \nsubstantial both for accumulating replications and for \ngenerating an empirical estimate of reproducibility.\nConcluding remarks. Small, low-powered studies are \nendemic in neuroscience. Nevertheless, there are reasons \nto be optimistic. Some fields are confronting the prob￾lem of the poor reliability of research findings that arises \nfrom low-powered studies. For example, in genetic epi￾demiology sample sizes increased dramatically with the \nwidespread understanding that the effects being sought \nare likely to be extremely small. This, together with an \nincreasing requirement for strong statistical evidence \nand independent replication, has resulted in far more \nreliable results. Moreover, the pressure for emphasiz￾ing significant results is not absolute. For example, the \nProteus phenomenon101 suggests that refuting early \nresults can be attractive in fields in which data can be \nproduced rapidly. Nevertheless, we should not assume \nthat science is effectively or efficiently self-correcting102. \nThere is now substantial evidence that a large propor￾tion of the evidence reported in the scientific literature \nmay be unreliable. Acknowledging this challenge is the \nfirst step towards addressing the problematic aspects \nof current scientific practices and identifying effective \nsolutions.\nBox 2 | Recommendations for researchers\nPerform an a priori power calculation\nUse the existing literature to estimate the size of effect you are looking for and design \nyour study accordingly. If time or financial constraints mean your study is \nunderpowered, make this clear and acknowledge this limitation (or limitations) in the \ninterpretation of your results.\nDisclose methods and findings transparently\nIf the intended analyses produce null findings and you move on to explore your data in \nother ways, say so. Null findings locked in file drawers bias the literature, whereas \nexploratory analyses are only useful and valid if you acknowledge the caveats and \nlimitations.\nPre-register your study protocol and analysis plan\nPre-registration clarifies whether analyses are confirmatory or exploratory, encourages \nwell-powered studies and reduces opportunities for non-transparent data mining and \nselective reporting. Various mechanisms for this exist (for example, the Open Science \nFramework).\nMake study materials and data available\nMaking research materials available will improve the quality of studies aimed at \nreplicating and extending research findings. Making raw data available will enhance \nopportunities for data aggregation and meta-analysis, and allow external checking of \nanalyses and results.\nWork collaboratively to increase power and replicate findings\nCombining data increases the total sample size (and therefore power) while minimizing \nthe labour and resource impact on any one contributor. Large-scale collaborative \nconsortia in fields such as human genetic epidemiology have transformed the reliability \nof findings in these fields.\nANALYSIS\n374 | MAY 2013 | VOLUME 14 www.nature.com/reviews/neuro\n© 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

It explains how low power leads to three major problems: incorrectly concluding that a difference does not exist (type II error or false negative), overstating the precision of a measurement (inflation of effect sizes), and overestimating the magnitude of an effect (winner's curse). These issues can lead to wasted resources, incorrect conclusions, and missed opportunities for further research. The author suggests several ways to address this problem, including increasing sample sizes, improving study design, and reporting standards. The article also mentions various initiatives aimed at promoting transparency, accuracy, and replicability in scientific research, such as registered reports, preregistration, and open data sharing. Overall, the article highlights the need for greater awareness and action regarding the importance of statistical power in scientific research."}

Since then I have authored, co-authored and reviewed\nabout 25 articles in JCDR. I thank JCDR for giving me an\nopportunity to improve my own skills as an author and a reviewer.\n\n\nIt 's a multispecialty journal, publishing high quality articles. It\ngives a platform to the authors to publish their research work which\ncan be available for everyone across the globe to read. The best\nthing about JCDR is that the full articles of all medical specialties\nare available as pdf/html for reading free of cost or without\ninstitutional subscription, which is not there for other journals. For\nthose who have problem in writing manuscript or do statistical\nwork, JCDR comes for their rescue.\nThe journal has a monthly publication and the articles are\npublished quite fast. In time compared to other journals. The on-\nline first publication is also a great advantage and facility to review\none's own articles before going to print. The response to any query\nand permission if required, is quite fast; this is quite commendable.\nI have a very good experience about seeking quick permission for\nquoting a photograph (Fig.) from a JCDR article for my chapter\nauthored in an E book. I never thought it would be so easy. No\nhassles.\nReviewing articles is no less a pain staking process and requires in\ndepth perception, knowledge about the topic for review. It requires\ntime and concentration, yet I enjoy doing it. The JCDR website\nespecially for the reviewers is quite user friendly. My suggestions\nfor improving the journal is, more strict review process, so that only\nhigh quality articles are published. I find a a good number of\narticles in Obst. Gynae, hence, a new journal for this specialty titled\nJCDR-OG can be started. May be a bimonthly or quarterly\npublication to begin with. Only selected articles should find a place\nin it.\nAn yearly reward for the best article authored can also incentivize\nthe authors. Though the process of finding the best article will be\nnot be very easy. I do not know how reviewing process can be\nimproved. If an article is being reviewed by two reviewers, then\nopinion of one can be communicated to the other or the final\nopinion of the editor can be communicated to the reviewer if\nrequested for. This will help one�s reviewing skills.\nMy best wishes to Dr. Hemant Jain and all the editorial staff of\nJCDR for their untiring efforts to bring out this journal. I strongly\nrecommend medical fraternity to publish their valuable research\nwork in this esteemed journal, JCDR\".\n\n\nDr. Mamta Gupta\nConsultant\n(Ex HOD Obs &Gynae, Hindu Rao Hospital and associated NDMC\nMedical College, Delhi)\nAug 2018\nDr. Rajendra Kumar Ghritlaharey\n\"I wish to thank Dr. Hemant Jain, Editor-in-Chief Journal of Clinical\nand Diagnostic Research (JCDR), for asking me to write up few\nwords.\nWriting is the representation of language in a textual medium i e;\ninto the words and sentences on paper. Quality medical manuscript\nwriting in particular, demands not only a high-quality research, but\nalso requires accurate and concise communication of findings and\nconclusions, with adherence to particular journal guidelines. In\nmedical field whether working in teaching, private, or in corporate\ninstitution, everyone wants to excel in his / her own field and get\nrecognised by making manuscripts publication.\nAuthors are the souls of any journal, and deserve much respect. To\npublish a journal manuscripts are needed from authors. Authors\nhave a great responsibility for producing facts of their work in\nterms of number and results truthfully and an individual honesty is\nexpected from authors in this regards. Both ways its true \"No\nauthors-No manuscripts-No journals\" and \"No journals�No\nmanuscripts�No authors\". Reviewing a manuscript is also a very\nresponsible and important task of any peer-reviewed journal and to\nbe taken seriously. It needs knowledge on the subject, sincerity,\nhonesty and determination. Although the process of reviewing a\nmanuscript is a time consuming task butit is expected to give one's\nbest remarks within the time frame of the journal.\nSalient features of the JCDR: It is a biomedical, multidisciplinary\n(including all medical and dental specialities), e-journal, with wide\nscope and extensive author support. At the same time, a free text of\nmanuscript is available in HTML and PDF format. There is fast\ngrowing authorship and readership with JCDR as this can be judged\nby the number of articles published in it i e; in Feb 2007 of its first\n\n\nissue, it contained 5 articles only, and now in its recent volume\npublished in April 2011, it contained 67 manuscripts. This e-journal\nis fulfilling the commitments and objectives sincerely, (as stated by\nEditor-in-chief in his preface to first edition) i e; to encourage\nphysicians through the internet, especially from the developing\ncountries who witness a spectrum of disease and acquire a wealth of\nknowledge to publish their experiences to benefit the medical\ncommunity in patients care. I also feel that many of us have work of\nsubstance, newer ideas, adequate clinical materials but poor in\nmedical writing and hesitation to submit the work and need help.\nJCDR provides authors help in this regards.\nTimely publication of journal: Publication of manuscripts and\nbringing out the issue in time is one of the positive aspects of JCDR\nand is possible with strong support team in terms of peer reviewers,\nproof reading, language check, computer operators, etc. This is one\nof the great reasons for authors to submit their work with JCDR.\nAnother best part of JCDR is \"Online first Publications\" facilities\navailable for the authors. This facility not only provides the prompt\npublications of the manuscripts but at the same time also early\navailability of the manuscripts for the readers.\nIndexation and online availability: Indexation transforms the\njournal in some sense from its local ownership to the worldwide\nprofessional community and to the public.JCDR is indexed with\nEmbase & EMbiology, Google Scholar, Index Copernicus, Chemical\nAbstracts Service, Journal seek Database, Indian Science Abstracts,\nto name few of them. Manuscriptspublished in JCDR are available\non major search engines ie; google, yahoo, msn.\nIn the era of fast growing newer technologies, and in computer and\ninternet friendly environment the manuscripts preparation,\nsubmission, review, revision, etc and all can be done and checked\nwith a click from all corer of the world, at any time. Of course there\nis always a scope for improvement in every field and none is\nperfect. To progress, one needs to identify the areas of one's\nweakness and to strengthen them.\nIt is well said that \"happy beginning is half done\" and it fits\nperfectly with JCDR. It has grown considerably and I feel it has\nalready grown up from its infancy to adolescence, achieving the\nstatus of standard online e-journal form Indian continent since its\ninception in Feb 2007. This had been made possible due to the\nefforts and the hard work put in it. The way the JCDR is improving\n\n\nwith every new volume, with good quality original manuscripts,\nmakes it a quality journal for readers. I must thank and\ncongratulate Dr Hemant Jain, Editor-in-Chief JCDR and his team for\ntheir sincere efforts, dedication, and determination for making\nJCDR a fast growing journal.\nEvery one of us: authors, reviewers, editors, and publisher are\nresponsible for enhancing the stature of the journal. I wish for a\ngreat success for JCDR.\"\nThanking you\nWith sincere regards\nDr. Rajendra Kumar Ghritlaharey, M.S., M. Ch., FAIS\nAssociate Professor,\nDepartment of Paediatric Surgery, Gandhi Medical College &\nAssociated\nKamla Nehru & Hamidia Hospitals Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh 462\n001 (India)\nE-mail: drrajendrak1@rediffmail.com\nOn May 11,2011\nDr. Shankar P.R.\n\"On looking back through my Gmail archives after being requested\nby the journal to write a short editorial about my experiences of\npublishing with the Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research\n(JCDR), I came across an e-mail from Dr. Hemant Jain, Editor, in\nMarch 2007, which introduced the new electronic journal. The\nmain features of the journal which were outlined in the e-mail were\nextensive author support, cash rewards, the peer review process,\nand other salient features of the journal.\nOver a span of over four years, we (I and my colleagues) have\npublished around 25 articles in the journal. In this editorial, I plan\nto briefly discuss my experiences of publishing with JCDR and the\nstrengths of the journal and to finally address the areas for\nimprovement.\nMy experiences of publishing with JCDR: Overall, my experiences\n\n\nof publishing withJCDR have been positive. The best point about\nthe journal is that it responds to queries from the author. This may\nseem to be simple and not too much to ask for, but unfortunately,\nmany journals in the subcontinent and from many developing\ncountries do not respond or they respond with a long delay to the\nqueries from the authors 1. The reasons could be many, including\nlack of optimal secretarial and other support. Another problem with\nmany journals is the slowness of the review process. Editorial\nprocessing and peer review can take anywhere between a year to\ntwo years with some journals. Also, some journals do not keep the\ncontributors informed about the progress of the review process. Due\nto the long review process, the articles can lose their relevance and\ntopicality. A major benefit with JCDR is the timeliness and\npromptness of its response. In Dr Jain's e-mail which was sent to me\nin 2007, before the introduction of the Pre-publishing system, he\nhad stated that he had received my submission and that he would\nget back to me within seven days and he did!\nMost of the manuscripts are published within 3 to 4 months of their\nsubmission if they are found to be suitable after the review process.\nJCDR is published bimonthly and the accepted articles were usually\npublished in the next issue. Recently, due to the increased volume\nof the submissions, the review process has become slower and it ??\nSection can take from 4 to 6 months for the articles to be reviewed.\nThe journal has an extensive author support system and it has\nrecently introduced a paid expedited review process. The journal\nalso mentions the average time for processing the manuscript under\ndifferent submission systems - regular submission and expedited\nreview.\nStrengths of the journal: The journal has an online first facility in\nwhich the accepted manuscripts may be published on the website\nbefore being included in a regular issue of the journal. This cuts\ndown the time between their acceptance and the publication. The\njournal is indexed in many databases, though not in PubMed. The\neditorial board should now take steps to index the journal in\nPubMed. The journal has a system of notifying readers through e-\nmail when a new issue is released. Also, the articles are available in\nboth the HTML and the PDF formats. I especially like the new and\ncolorful page format of the journal. Also, the access statistics of the\narticles are available. The prepublication and the manuscript\ntracking system are also helpful for the authors.\n\n\nAreas for improvement: In certain cases, I felt that the peer review\nprocess of the manuscripts was not up to international standards\nand that it should be strengthened. Also, the number of manuscripts\nin an issue is high and it may be difficult for readers to go through\nall of them. The journal can consider tightening of the peer review\nprocess and increasing the quality standards for the acceptance of\nthe manuscripts. I faced occasional problems with the online\nmanuscript submission (Pre-publishing) system, which have to be\naddressed.\nOverall, the publishing process with JCDR has been smooth, quick\nand relatively hassle free and I can recommend other authors to\nconsider the journal as an outlet for their work.\"\nDr. P.

I thank JCDR for giving me an\nopportunity to improve my own skills as an author and a reviewer.\n\n\nIt 's a multispecialty journal, publishing high quality articles. It\ngives a platform to the authors to publish their research work which\ncan be available for everyone across the globe to read. The best\nthing about JCDR is that the full articles of all medical specialties\nare available as pdf/html for reading free of cost or without\ninstitutional subscription, which is not there for other journals. For\nthose who have problem in writing manuscript or do statistical\nwork, JCDR comes for their rescue.\nThe journal has a monthly publication and the articles are\npublished quite fast. In time compared to other journals. The on-\nline first publication is also a great advantage and facility to review\none's own articles before going to print. The response to any query\nand permission if required, is quite fast; this is quite commendable.\nI have a very good experience about seeking quick permission for\nquoting a photograph (Fig.) from a JCDR article for my chapter\nauthored in an E book. I never thought it would be so easy. No\nhassles.\nReviewing articles is no less a pain staking process and requires in\ndepth perception, knowledge about the topic for review. It requires\ntime and concentration, yet I enjoy doing it. The JCDR website\nespecially for the reviewers is quite user friendly. My suggestions\nfor improving the journal is, more strict review process, so that only\nhigh quality articles are published. I find a a good number of\narticles in Obst. Gynae, hence, a new journal for this specialty titled\nJCDR-OG can be started. May be a bimonthly or quarterly\npublication to begin with. Only selected articles should find a place\nin it.\nAn yearly reward for the best article authored can also incentivize\nthe authors. Though the process of finding the best article will be\nnot be very easy. I do not know how reviewing process can be\nimproved. If an article is being reviewed by two reviewers, then\nopinion of one can be communicated to the other or the final\nopinion of the editor can be communicated to the reviewer if\nrequested for. This will help one�s reviewing skills.\nMy best wishes to Dr. Hemant Jain and all the editorial staff of\nJCDR for their untiring efforts to bring out this journal. I strongly\nrecommend medical fraternity to publish their valuable research\nwork in this esteemed journal, JCDR\".\n\n\nDr. Mamta Gupta\nConsultant\n(Ex HOD Obs &Gynae, Hindu Rao Hospital and associated NDMC\nMedical College, Delhi)\nAug 2018\nDr. Rajendra Kumar Ghritlaharey\n\"I wish to thank Dr. Hemant Jain, Editor-in-Chief Journal of Clinical\nand Diagnostic Research (JCDR), for asking me to write up few\nwords.\nWriting is the representation of language in a textual medium i e;\ninto the words and sentences on paper. Quality medical manuscript\nwriting in particular, demands not only a high-quality research, but\nalso requires accurate and concise communication of findings and\nconclusions, with adherence to particular journal guidelines. In\nmedical field whether working in teaching, private, or in corporate\ninstitution, everyone wants to excel in his / her own field and get\nrecognised by making manuscripts publication.\nAuthors are the souls of any journal, and deserve much respect. To\npublish a journal manuscripts are needed from authors. Authors\nhave a great responsibility for producing facts of their work in\nterms of number and results truthfully and an individual honesty is\nexpected from authors in this regards. Both ways its true \"No\nauthors-No manuscripts-No journals\" and \"No journals�No\nmanuscripts�No authors\". Reviewing a manuscript is also a very\nresponsible and important task of any peer-reviewed journal and to\nbe taken seriously. It needs knowledge on the subject, sincerity,\nhonesty and determination. Although the process of reviewing a\nmanuscript is a time consuming task butit is expected to give one's\nbest remarks within the time frame of the journal.\nSalient features of the JCDR: It is a biomedical, multidisciplinary\n(including all medical and dental specialities), e-journal, with wide\nscope and extensive author support. At the same time, a free text of\nmanuscript is available in HTML and PDF format. There is fast\ngrowing authorship and readership with JCDR as this can be judged\nby the number of articles published in it i e; in Feb 2007 of its first\n\n\nissue, it contained 5 articles only, and now in its recent volume\npublished in April 2011, it contained 67 manuscripts. This e-journal\nis fulfilling the commitments and objectives sincerely, (as stated by\nEditor-in-chief in his preface to first edition) i e; to encourage\nphysicians through the internet, especially from the developing\ncountries who witness a spectrum of disease and acquire a wealth of\nknowledge to publish their experiences to benefit the medical\ncommunity in patients care. I also feel that many of us have work of\nsubstance, newer ideas, adequate clinical materials but poor in\nmedical writing and hesitation to submit the work and need help.\nJCDR provides authors help in this regards.\nTimely publication of journal: Publication of manuscripts and\nbringing out the issue in time is one of the positive aspects of JCDR\nand is possible with strong support team in terms of peer reviewers,\nproof reading, language check, computer operators, etc. This is one\nof the great reasons for authors to submit their work with JCDR.\nAnother best part of JCDR is \"Online first Publications\" facilities\navailable for the authors. This facility not only provides the prompt\npublications of the manuscripts but at the same time also early\navailability of the manuscripts for the readers.\nIndexation and online availability: Indexation transforms the\njournal in some sense from its local ownership to the worldwide\nprofessional community and to the public.JCDR is indexed with\nEmbase & EMbiology, Google Scholar, Index Copernicus, Chemical\nAbstracts Service, Journal seek Database, Indian Science Abstracts,\nto name few of them. Manuscriptspublished in JCDR are available\non major search engines ie; google, yahoo, msn.\nIn the era of fast growing newer technologies, and in computer and\ninternet friendly environment the manuscripts preparation,\nsubmission, review, revision, etc and all can be done and checked\nwith a click from all corer of the world, at any time. Of course there\nis always a scope for improvement in every field and none is\nperfect. To progress, one needs to identify the areas of one's\nweakness and to strengthen them.\nIt is well said that \"happy beginning is half done\" and it fits\nperfectly with JCDR. It has grown considerably and I feel it has\nalready grown up from its infancy to adolescence, achieving the\nstatus of standard online e-journal form Indian continent since its\ninception in Feb 2007. This had been made possible due to the\nefforts and the hard work put in it. The way the JCDR is improving\n\n\nwith every new volume, with good quality original manuscripts,\nmakes it a quality journal for readers. I must thank and\ncongratulate Dr Hemant Jain, Editor-in-Chief JCDR and his team for\ntheir sincere efforts, dedication, and determination for making\nJCDR a fast growing journal.\nEvery one of us: authors, reviewers, editors, and publisher are\nresponsible for enhancing the stature of the journal. I wish for a\ngreat success for JCDR.\"\nThanking you\nWith sincere regards\nDr. Rajendra Kumar Ghritlaharey, M.S., M.

The\nmain features of the journal which were outlined in the e-mail were\nextensive author support, cash rewards, the peer review process,\nand other salient features of the journal.\nOver a span of over four years, we (I and my colleagues) have\npublished around 25 articles in the journal. In this editorial, I plan\nto briefly discuss my experiences of publishing with JCDR and the\nstrengths of the journal and to finally address the areas for\nimprovement.\nMy experiences of publishing with JCDR: Overall, my experiences\n\n\nof publishing withJCDR have been positive. The best point about\nthe journal is that it responds to queries from the author. This may\nseem to be simple and not too much to ask for, but unfortunately,\nmany journals in the subcontinent and from many developing\ncountries do not respond or they respond with a long delay to the\nqueries from the authors 1. The reasons could be many, including\nlack of optimal secretarial and other support. Another problem with\nmany journals is the slowness of the review process. Editorial\nprocessing and peer review can take anywhere between a year to\ntwo years with some journals. Also, some journals do not keep the\ncontributors informed about the progress of the review process. Due\nto the long review process, the articles can lose their relevance and\ntopicality. A major benefit with JCDR is the timeliness and\npromptness of its response. In Dr Jain's e-mail which was sent to me\nin 2007, before the introduction of the Pre-publishing system, he\nhad stated that he had received my submission and that he would\nget back to me within seven days and he did!\nMost of the manuscripts are published within 3 to 4 months of their\nsubmission if they are found to be suitable after the review process.\nJCDR is published bimonthly and the accepted articles were usually\npublished in the next issue. Recently, due to the increased volume\nof the submissions, the review process has become slower and it ??\nSection can take from 4 to 6 months for the articles to be reviewed.\nThe journal has an extensive author support system and it has\nrecently introduced a paid expedited review process. The journal\nalso mentions the average time for processing the manuscript under\ndifferent submission systems - regular submission and expedited\nreview.\nStrengths of the journal: The journal has an online first facility in\nwhich the accepted manuscripts may be published on the website\nbefore being included in a regular issue of the journal. This cuts\ndown the time between their acceptance and the publication. The\njournal is indexed in many databases, though not in PubMed. The\neditorial board should now take steps to index the journal in\nPubMed. The journal has a system of notifying readers through e-\nmail when a new issue is released. Also, the articles are available in\nboth the HTML and the PDF formats. I especially like the new and\ncolorful page format of the journal. Also, the access statistics of the\narticles are available. The prepublication and the manuscript\ntracking system are also helpful for the authors.\n\n\nAreas for improvement: In certain cases, I felt that the peer review\nprocess of the manuscripts was not up to international standards\nand that it should be strengthened. Also, the number of manuscripts\nin an issue is high and it may be difficult for readers to go through\nall of them. The journal can consider tightening of the peer review\nprocess and increasing the quality standards for the acceptance of\nthe manuscripts. I faced occasional problems with the online\nmanuscript submission (Pre-publishing) system, which have to be\naddressed.\nOverall, the publishing process with JCDR has been smooth, quick\nand relatively hassle free and I can recommend other authors to\nconsider the journal as an outlet for their work.\"\nDr. P.

Known methods range from node centralities, such as degree,\ncloseness and betweenness, to diffusion-based processes, like PageRank and LeaderRank. Some of these methods already\ntake into account the influences of a node’s neighbors but do not directly make use of the interactions among it’s\nneighbors. Local clustering is known to have negative impacts on the information spreading. We further show empirically\nthat it also plays a negative role in generating local connections. Inspired by these facts, we propose a local ranking\nalgorithm named ClusterRank, which takes into account not only the number of neighbors and the neighbors’ influences,\nbut also the clustering coefficient. Subject to the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) spreading model with constant\ninfectivity, experimental results on two directed networks, a social network extracted from delicious.com and a large-scale\nshort-message communication network, demonstrate that the ClusterRank outperforms some benchmark algorithms such\nas PageRank and LeaderRank. Furthermore, ClusterRank can also be applied to undirected networks where the superiority\nof ClusterRank is significant compared with degree centrality and k-core decomposition. In addition, ClusterRank, only\nmaking use of local information, is much more efficient than global methods: It takes only 191 seconds for a network with\nabout 107 nodes, more than 15 times faster than PageRank.\nCitation: Chen D-B, Gao H, Lu¨ L, Zhou T (2013) Identifying Influential Nodes in Large-Scale Directed Networks: The Role of Clustering.

Therein how to control the\nspreading process is of particular interests [5], where the\nidentification of influential nodes is a crucial issue according to\nthe assumption that highly influential nodes are more likely to be\ninfected and to infect a larger number of nodes [6–8].\nA number of centrality indices have been proposed to address\nthis problem, such as degree centrality, closeness centrality [9],\nbetweenness centrality [10], and eigenvector centrality [11].\nDegree centrality is a straightforward and efficient metric but less\nrelevant. Recent researches show that top-degree ranking nodes\nhave positive effects on cooperative behaviors in social networks\n[12,13]. However, the location of a node in the network may play\na more important role than its degree. For example, a node\nlocated in the center of the network, having a few highly influential\nneighbors, may be more influential than a node having a larger\nnumber of less influential neighbors. Considering this fact, Kitsak\net al. [6] proposed a coarse-grained method by using k-core\ndecomposition to quantify a node’s influence based on the\nassumption that nodes in the same shell have similar influence\nand nodes in higher-level shells are likely to infect more nodes.\nThis method may fail in some cases. For example, in a tree, all\nnodes are in 1-core and thus expected to have the same influence\naccording to [6]. However, this tree may be hierarchically\norganized (e.g., the binary tree) and nodes near the root have\nmuch higher influence than leaves. Chen et al. [14] devised a semi￾local index by considering the next nearest neighborhood, which\ncan well identify influential nodes in a hierarchical tree and give\nmore elaborate division than k-core decomposition. Experimental\nresults demonstrated that the semi-local index performs as good as\nglobal indices while has much lower computational complexity,\nand thus it obtains a good trade-off on effectiveness and efficiency.\nRecently, Chen et al. [15] considered the effect of path number\nand path diversity while ranking the spreading ability of nodes in\nnetworks and introduced two correction factors correspondingly.\nThe ranking accuracy is considerably increased compared with\nsome well-known ranking methods, such as PageRank and\nLeaderRank.\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e77455\n\nWith explosive data growth, the design of efficient and effective\nranking algorithms on very large-scale networks is becoming a big\nchallenge nowadays [16]. The representative methods include the\nwell-known HITs [17] and PageRank [18], as well as some\nrecently proposed algorithms like LeaderRank [7,19] and\nTwitterRank [20]. All these algorithms are diffusion based (or\nsay random-walk based), with a common assumption that a node is\nexpected to be of high influence if it points to many highly\ninfluential neighbors (here, a link from i to j indicates that j is a\nfollower of i). It has been demonstrated that these methods\noutperform out-degree centrality in terms of ranking effectiveness.\nIn addition to the direct influential scores of neighbors, the\ninteractions among neighbors may also play a significant role. The\ndensity of interactions among neighbors can be characterized by\nthe local clustering coefficient [21], which has great impacts on\nnetwork dynamics, such as game theory [12,13,22–24], cascading\n[25], synchronization [26,27] and spreading [28–31]. Empirical\nanalysis also shows that nodes with smaller clustering have higher\nability to attract new connections [32,33].\nKeeping this in mind, in this paper, we propose a local ranking\nmethod, named ClusterRank, to identify influential nodes in\ndirected networks by taking into account the effects of local\nclustering on information propagation. Besides the localization of\nour algorithm, another distinguishable difference from the above￾mentioned diffusion-based algorithms is that the clustering\ncoefficient is directly involved in the definition of a node’s\ninfluence in ClusterRank. We apply the SIR spreading model with\nconstant infectivity to test the effectiveness of our method on four\nreal networks, including two large-scale directed networks (a social\nnetwork extracted from delicious.com consisting of 6|105 nodes and\na short-message communication network containing about 107\nnodes) and two undirected networks (one is collaboration network\nfrom condensed matter e-print archive consisting of about 3|104\nnodes [34] and the other is an undirected version of the social\nnetwork from delicious.com). Experimental results show that\nClusterRank performs much better than the simplest degree\ncentrality, and the top-L influential nodes identified by Cluster￾Rank lead to much wider and faster spreading than those by\nPageRank or LeaderRank. Besides, the computations of Cluster￾Rank on the network with 10 millions of nodes can be finished in\n191 seconds by using C#.net language on a Core II 2.0 GHZ\nCPU processor with 2 GB memory, more than 15 times faster\nthan PageRank algorithm.\nMaterials and Methods\n1.1 Empirical Analysis\nMany social networks can be represented by directed networks\nwhere a link from i to j means j is a follower of i, indicating that j\nreceives information from i. We denote Ci as the set of followers of\ni and the density of interactions among i’s followers can be\ncharacterized by the local clustering coefficient of i. Based on the\noriginal definition of clustering coefficient [21], the clustering\ncoefficient of node i in a directed network is extended as:\nci~DfejkDj, k[CigD\nkout\ni (kout\ni {1) , ð1Þ\nwhere kout\ni is the out-degree of i, namely the number of followers\nof i, and fejkDj, k[Cig is the set of links connecting two of i’s\nfollowers. Let ci~0 if kout\ni ƒ1. According to Eq. (1), a reciprocal\nlink j<k is counted as two separate links j?k and k?j.\nThe local clustering has remarkable impacts on network\nstructure and functions. Studying the effects of clustering\ncoefficient on the network evolving can provide insights into the\nunderstanding of growing mechanism and further help us to\ndesign better link prediction algorithms [35–37] and to explain the\nobservation on information spreading through online social\nnetworks [30]. Some literatures showed that the clustering has\nnegative correlation with degree in undirected networks [38] or\nwith total degree in directed networks [39]. Here, we take two real\nevolving networks as examples to analyze the effect of clustering\ncoefficient. One is a collaboration network from condensed matter\ne-print archive (Cond-mat for short) [34], the other is a short￾message communication network (SM for short) from a mobile\ncompany in eastern China city. For each network, we consider two\nsnapshots which contain the data starting from a given date (T0)\nbut ending with different dates (i.e., T1 and T2 respectively).\nSpecifically, the first network of Cond-mat is from Jan. 1st, 1995\n(T0) to Dec. 13th, 1999 (T1) containing 16264 nodes and 47594\nlinks, and the second network of Cond-mat is from Jan. 1, 1995\n(T0) to Jun. 30, 2003 (T2) containing 30460 nodes and 120029\nlinks. Similarly, for SM, the first network consists of the data from\nDec. 8th to Dec. 17th, 2010 with 3612863 nodes and 7472808\nlinks, and the second network is from Dec. 8th, 2010 to Jan. 6th,\n2011 with 9193545 nodes and 22901318 links. Here, Cond-mat is\nundirected and SM is directed where a link from i to j represents\nthat i has sent at least one message to j.\nIn the first network (from T0 to T1), we denote N(k) the set of\nnodes with degree k. Without specific statement, a node’s degree\nin a directed network stands for its out-degree. Note that, we here\nonly consider the nodes with degrees larger than 1. Denote Q(k)\nthe set of node pairs (i,j) such that civcj and ki~kj~k, clearly,\nDQ(k)Dƒ1\n2 DN(k)D(DN(k)D{1). For each pair (i,j)[Q(k), there are\nthree cases according to i’s and j’s degrees (denoted by ~\nki and ~\nkj)\nin the second network (from T0 to T2): (i) ~\nkiw~\nkj indicating that the\nnode with lower clustering coefficient attracts more connections\nduring the period T1?T2; (ii) ~\nkiv~\nkj indicating that the node with\nhigher clustering coefficient attracts more connections during the\nperiod T1?T2; (iii) ~\nki~~\nkj indicating that these two nodes have\nthe same ability to attract new connections. Accordingly, we define\na score fk to see whether nodes with lower clustering coefficients\nhave higher ability to attract more connections. It mathematically\nreads\nfk~ 1\nDQ(k)D\nX\n(i,j)[Q(k)\nhij, ð2Þ\nwhere hij is the score depending on the aforementioned cases, as\nhij~\n1, ~\nkiw~\nkj\n{1, ~\nkiv~\nkj\n0, ~\nki~~\nkj\n:\n8\n><\n>:\nð3Þ\nObviously, fkw0 indicates that nodes having lower clustering\ncoefficients are more likely to attract new connections than those\n(with the same degree) having higher clustering coefficients, while\nfkv0 is the opposite situation. The correlation between fk and\ndegree k is shown in figure 1 where the area of a circle is\nproportional to the number of nodes with the corresponding\ndegree. As shown in figure 1, in Cond-mat, fk is larger than zero\nfor 2ƒkv20 which covers 95% of all nodes with degree larger\nIdentifying Influential Nodes in Directed Networks\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 October 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e77455\n\nthan 1 and in SM, fk is larger than zero for 2ƒkv5 which covers\n60.3% of all nodes with degree larger than 1. In addition, for small\nk, the statistics are more reliable since the number of samples is\nlarge while fk displays large fluctuations for large k where the\nstatistics are less reliable due to the limited statistical samples. The\nmajority of node pairs with positive fk indicates that a node with\nsmaller clustering coefficient statistically has higher ability to\nattract new connections. In figure 2, we show the increment of\ndegree, Dk, from T1 to T2. These nodes are of the same degree\n(k~5) but different clustering coefficients at time T1. Generally\nspeaking, Dk decreases with the increasing of clustering. In a word,\nthe above empirical results (see figures 1 and 2) demonstrate that a\nnode with smaller clustering coefficient is likely to attract more\nconnections in the future.\n1.2 Cluster Rank Algorithm\nBased on the empirical observation, we here propose a local\nranking index, named ClusterRank, to quantify the influence of a\nnode by taking into account not only its direct influence (measured\nby the number of its followers) and influences of its neighbors, but\nalso its clustering coefficient. Mathematically, the ClusterRank\nscore si of node i is defined as:\nsi~f (ci)\nX\nj[Ci\n(kout\nj z1), ð4Þ\nwhere the term f (ci) accounts for the effect of i’s local clustering\nand the term ‘+1’ results from the contribution of j itself. Usually,\nthe local clustering plays a negative role in spreading [28,29,40]\nsince if i’s followers closely interact with each other rather than\nwith other nodes, the spreading initiated from node i is more likely\nto be confined in a local region. On the contrary, if i’s neighbors\nare mostly connected with nodes other than i’s neighbors, the\ninformation will quickly spread to a large scope. For example, in\nfigure 3, although node 0 has the same out-degree with node 37,\nnode 37, with lower clustering, is of higher influence than node 0,\nsince most of node 37’s neighbors point to nodes other than\nthemselves and thus can send the information to wide audiences.\nWe here adopt a simple exponential function, namely\nf (ci)~10{ci , a decreasing function of ci. Actually, we can apply\na more complicated form by introducing a new parameter, such as\na{ci or ca\ni . However, it adds little value to rank nodes but make\nthe analysis more complicated. Indeed, the perspective and results\nof this paper are not limited by a very specific function of ci.\nFor comparison, we briefly introduce two benchmark ranking\nalgorithms on directed networks, PageRank [18] and LeaderRank\n[7]. PageRank is depicted as a random walk on hyperlinked\nnetworks. Each web page (i.e., a node) is assigned a score\naccording to its relative importance. A parameter c is introduced\nas the probability for which a web page surfers to jump to a\nrandom web page, and for probability 1{c a web page surfers to\ncontinue browsing through hyperlinks. Therefore, in our case the\nscore si(t) for node i at time step t is given by:\nsi(t)~cz(1{c)\nXN\nj~1\naij\nkin\nj\n1{dkin\nj ,0 \u0001 z\n1\nN dkin\nj ,0 \" #sj(t{1), ð5Þ\nwhere kin\nj is the in-degree of node j (i.e., the number of leaders of\nnode j), N is the number of nodes of the network, aij~1 if there\nexists a link from i to j (indicating the information flow is from i to\nj), otherwise aij~0, and dkin\nj ,0~1 if kin\nj ~0, otherwise dkin\nj ,0~0.\nInitially, si(0) is set to be 1 for each node i, and the parameter c is\nalways fixed as 0.15 in the experiments.\nLeaderRank is also a random-walk-based ranking algorithm [7].\nOn the basis of PageRank, LeaderRank introduces a ground node\ng, which has two directed links egi and eig to every node i in the\noriginal network, so that the network will become strongly\nconnected. The score si(t) of node i at time t is given by\n(according to a purely random walk process):\nsi(t)~\nN\nXz1\nj~1\naij\nkin\nj\nsj(t{1): ð6Þ\nInitially, sg(0)~0 for the ground node g, and si(0)~1 for every\nother node i. At the steady state, the score of the ground node is\nequally distributed to all other nodes to conserve scores on the\nnodes of interest. Therefore, the final score of node i, called its\nleadership score, is defined as\nSi~si(t?)zsg(t?)\nN , ð7Þ\nFigure 1. The correlation between fk and the degree in the first network k.

(6). Notice that, although LeaderRank is similar to PageRank,\nit is able to dig out more influential nodes and is more stable to\nnoise and more robust to attacks than PageRank [7]. More\nsignificantly, LeaderRank is a parameter-free ranking method.\nComparing with PageRank, LeaderRank just introduces a small\nmodification yet leads to considerable improvements.\n1.3 Data Description\nTo evaluate influences of different groups of top-ranked nodes\nrespectively obtained by out-degree centrality, PageRank, Lea￾derRank, k-core decomposition and ClusterRank, experiments are\ncarried out on two real directed social networks and two\nundirected networks. (i) Delicious: a directed social network\nextracted from the web site delicious.com, where the primary\nfunction of users is to collect useful bookmarks with tags. Users can\nselect other users to be their ‘‘opinion leaders’’ of web browsing, in\nthe sense that the bookmarks of the leaders are often useful and\nrelevant. The subscriptions to leaders’ bookmarks can be made\nautomatically. Of course users who select their leaders can in turn\nbe the leaders of others. In that way, the users form a large-scale\ndirected social network with information flows from leaders to\nfollowers. (ii) SM: a directed short-message communication\nnetwork of a mobile company in 31 days from Dec. 8th, 2010\nto Jan. 7th, 2011. In this network, each node corresponds to a\nmobile phone number, and a link from i to j means that i has sent\nat least one short message to j during these 31 days. We are\ninterested in this data set because the information such as rumor\nmay spread out in this communication network via message\nforwarding and influential spreaders play an important role in the\nFigure 2. The increment of degree Dk in the period T1?T2 of nodes with the same degree (k~5) but different clustering coefficients\nat time T1. Dk is the average value of a bin (size = 0.1) on clustering coefficient. For example, the value of Dk corresponding to c~0:1 is the average\nvalue of Dk of the nodes with clustering coefficient in (0:05,0:15\u0001. The error bars stand for standard errors.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0077455.g002\nFigure 3. An example network with 38 nodes and 110 directed edges. Although nodes 0 and 37 have the same out-degree, node 37 is of\nhigher influence (subject to spreading dynamics) than node 0.

(iii) Cond-mat: a collaboration network of\nscientists who have posted preprints on the condensed matter\narchive at www.arxiv.org between Jan. 1st, 1995 and Jun. 30th,\n2003. In this network, a node represents an author, and an edge\nconnecting two authors if they have co-authorized at least one\npaper. The academic perspectives and the news of academic\nactivities may propagate in this collaboration network and some\nkey authors play the central role in the propagation. (iv)\nDeliciousUN: the undirected version of Delicious network where\nthe directed links are transformed into undirected links. Some\nbasic statistical features of these four networks, including the\nnumber of nodes, the number of links, maximum out-degree (or\nmaximum degree for undirected network) kmax, average out￾degree (or average degree for undirected network) SkT and\naverage clustering coefficient ScT, are shown in Table 1.\nResults\n2.1 Evaluation on Directed Networks\nThe computation times of four ranking algorithms on Delicious\nand SM networks are shown in Table 2. Out-degree is the fastest\nwith runtime less than a second. Comparing with the diffusion￾based methods (i.e., PageRank and LeaderRank), the time\ncomplexity of ClusterRank is much lower (a magnitude reduction).\nTherefore, the ClusterRank may be a promising method for very\nlarge-scale networks.\nSusceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model is usually used to\nmimic the spreading processes of disease where infected nodes will\neither get immunity or die [41]. Individuals in SIR model are\nclassified in three classes according to their states: susceptible (will\nnot infect others but can be infected), infected (have infectivity),\nrecovered (recovered from the illness and got immunity thus will\nnot take part in the epidemic process, or died and thus removed\nfrom the systems). The simulation runs in discrete time steps. At\neach time step, every infected node randomly selects a follower\nand transmit the information or disease to her with probability m if\nthis follower is a susceptible one. At the same time, each infected\nnode recovers with probability b, and the infected rate l is defined\nas m=b. The simulation stops when there is no infected node\nanymore. Notice that this model is slightly different from the\nstandard SIR model where all the followers of an infected node\nhave the chance to be infected. The present mechanism is usually\nused to mimic the limited spreading capability of individuals\n[42,43].\nTo investigate the ability of identifying influential nodes of a\nranking method, we focus on top-L ranked nodes by out-degree\ncentrality. Here we set L = 20 and 50 as two examples. The ranks\nof these L nodes by other ranking methods can be obtained via\nselecting them from the whole ranking lists. Then we can calculate\nthe correlation between each pair of ranking methods by Kendall’s\ntau, as shown in Table 3. It can be seen that LeaderRank and\nPageRank are highly correlated. The correlation between\nClusterRank and out-degree centrality is low in Delicious while\nrelatively high in SM, this is because of the small clustering\ncoefficient of SM which makes f (ci) play little role in Eq. (4). For\nthe L nodes with maximal out-degrees, we also investigate the\ncorrelation between the ranking scores provided by different\nmethods and the real spreading abilities, see Table 4. The ratio\nbetween the number of infected and recovered nodes and the total\nnumber of nodes at time t, denoted by F(t), can be considered as\nan indicator to evaluate the influence at time t. Clearly, F(t)\nincreases with t, and eventually gets steady. The final coverage\nFi\n(tc) of node i is used to represent the real spreading ability of i\nwhere i is set to be infected initially. Higher Fi\n(tc) indicates higher\ninfluence of node i. Overall speaking, the Kendall’s tau for\nClusterRank is the largest.\nTo investigate the influence of a group of nodes in information\nspreading, we initially set these nodes to be infected. We use the\nsteady value, F(tc), to evaluate the eventual influence of these\ninitially infected nodes. Higher F(tc) indicates higher influence.\nWe choose the top-L (this paper considers L~20 and L~50)\nranked nodes, which are respectively identified by out-degree\ncentrality, PageRank, LeaderRank and ClusterRank, and set them\nas initially infected nodes in the experiments. Figure 4 compares\nF(t) with the top-L ranked nodes as the initially infected ones by\nout-degree, PageRank, LeaderRank and ClusterRank for Deli￾cious and SM networks. From figure 4, one can see that the initial\nseeds obtained by ClusterRank result in faster and wider spreading\nthan by other ranking methods.\nSince there are a considerable number of overlapped nodes in\ntop-ranked lists of any two algorithms (see Table 5), we next\nTable 1.

That is, each time when we compare\nthe ClusterRank and another algorithm, the nodes appeared in\nonly one list are set to be the initially infected ones. For example,\nfor Delicious, considering the top-20 lists for out-degree centrality\nand ClusterRank, there are 8 non-overlapped nodes, we compare\nthe spreading processes respectively resulted from the 8 nodes\nappeared only in the list by ClusterRank and the 8 nodes appeared\nonly in the list by out-degree centrality. Figure 5 shows the ratio\nbetween the total number of infected and recovered nodes of\nClusterRank and those of the other ranking algorithms, namely\nFClusterRank(t)=F(t), where FClusterRank(t) is the ratio of the total\nnumber of infected and recovered nodes to all nodes at time t for\nClusterRank, and F(t) stands for the corresponding quantity of\nthe compared algorithm (i.e., out-degree centrality, PageRank or\nLeaderRank). Therefore, the degree to which FClusterRank(t)=F(t)\nexceeds 1 indicates how much better ClusterRank performs than\nother methods. From figure 5, one can see that in most cases the\nratio is obviously larger than 1.\nFigure 6 shows F(tc) resulted from the top-50 most influential\nnodes at different infected rates l. It can be seen that F(tc) resulted\nfrom the top-50 most influential nodes by ClusterRank is larger\nthan that by other ranking algorithms. Figure 7 shows the ratio of\nthe number of ever infected (i.e., finally recovered) nodes resulted\nfrom top-ranked nodes by ClusterRank to those by other ranking\nalgorithms at different infected rates l. Note that, in figure 7, only\nnon-overlapped node appeared in the top-50 lists by ClusterRank\nand other ranking algorithms are initially set to be infected. The\nratio is up to 2 when l~1:4 for Delicious network (see figure 7(a))\nand it approaches 20 (surprisingly high) when l~1:9 for SM\nnetwork (see figure 7(b)). In fact, some nodes in the SM network\nare of very large out-degree but the out-degree of their followers\nare very small. These nodes are not as important as their out￾degrees indicate, and ClusterRank could dig out really influential\nTable 4.

In this\nsubsection, we will further show the superiority of ClusterRank\non undirected networks by comparing it with degree centrality and\nk-core decomposition. Here, we don’t consider PageRank and\nLeaderRank because they all degenerate to degree centrality in\nundirected networks. We use two types of initialization for SIR\nexperiments. In the first case, we directly set the top-L (we set\nL~50 in the experiment) ranked non-overlapped nodes to be\ninitially infected regardless of how they connect with each other.\nThe selection method for initial seeds is similar to what we have\nused in figure 5. In the second case, we only consider a group of\nnodes with no connection between any two of them as initial seeds.\nSpecifically, there are two steps. In the first step, for each ranking\nmethod, we select L nodes who are highly ranked nodes but not\nconnected with each other according to the following process: (i)\nSelect the top ranked node v in the current network; (ii) Remove v\nand all her neighbors from the network; (iii) Repeat step (i) and\nstep (ii) until L nodes have been selected. The second step is to\nidentify the non-overlapped nodes between ClusterRank and other\ncompared methods. For more details of how to select the initial\nseeds, readers could refer to Ref. [44].\nFigure 8 shows the dependence of FClusterRank(tc)=F(tc) on l\nfor the undirected Delicious network and Cond-mat network,\nwhere FClusterRank(tc) is the ratio of the total number of infected\nand recovered nodes to all nodes at time tc for ClusterRank, and\nF(tc) stands for the corresponding quantity of degree centrality or\nk-core decomposition. For the first case, see figures 8(a) and 8(c),\nthe eventually infected size of ClusterRank is larger than that of\ndegree centrality and k-core decomposition. In DeliciousUN, the\nFigure 5.

Initially only non-overlapped nodes in the top-L lists obtained by ClusterRank and other ranking algorithms are set to be infected. We\nset l~1:2 and b~1=SkoutT. Each data point is obtained by averaging over 100 independent runs.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0077455.g005\nTable 5.

This reminds us that as\na group of initial infected nodes, k-core decomposition may\nperform even worse than degree centrality [6], since the selected\nnodes identified by k-core decomposition are usually in the same\ncore and thus densely connected with each other while the nodes\nselected by degree centrality or ClusterRank are usually located at\ndifferent cores and thus sparsely connected. Apparently, Cluster￾Rank is much more advanced than degree centrality. Similar\nresults are also found in Cond-mat network, see figure 8(c). Note\nthat, Cond-mat network is highly clustered with clustering\ncoefficient ScT~0:6461, because there are many cliques each of\nwhich is constituted by a group of co-authors of a paper. Therefore\nthe authors whose collaborators closely collaborate with each other\nwill be highly depressed by ClusterRank due to their high\nclustering coefficients. The researcher with diverse collaborators\nwho are usually belong to different communities will be more\ninfluential than those who only collaborates with people in one\ncommunity. For the second case, with the consideration of the\nnodes that are not directly connected with each other the\nperformance of k-core decomposition is improved. Specifically,\nin DeliciousUN, ClusterRank performs much better than degree\ncentrality especially for the middle region of l and better than that\nof k-core decomposition for 1:0ƒlƒ1:7. In Cond-mat network,\nthe results of ClusterRank are still better than degree centrality\nand k-core decomposition in the middle region of l, and for other\nregion, their performances are comparable. The investigations for\nvery small or very large infected probability l are meaningless.\nWhen l is too small (e.g., lv1), it will be hardly spread out from\nany group of initial nodes, and for large l, most of the nodes will\nget infected and thus the difference resulted from initialization will\nbecome less significant. The results shown in figure 8 demonstrate\nthat ClusterRank also performs better than degree centrality and\nk-core decomposition in undirected networks.\nDiscussion\nIdentifying most influential nodes in very large-scale directed\nnetworks is a key issue in network analysis, disease control, and so\non. An effective and efficient ranking algorithm is proposed in this\nFigure 6. The dependence of F(tc) on parameter l.

Experimental results on Delicious and SM\nnetworks demonstrate that the information can spread more\nquickly and broadly from top-L nodes obtained by our method\nthan that by out-degree centrality, PageRank or LeaderRank.\nFurthermore, the method presented in this paper can be easily\nextended to undirected networks, for which PageRank and\nLeaderRank all degenerate to degree centrality. Experiments on\nthe Cond-mat and undirected Delicious networks show that the\nperformance of our method is also better than that of degree\ncentrality and k-core decomposition for undirected networks.\nHow to effectively and efficiently identify influential nodes in\nvery large-scale networks is a long-standing challenge. Lastly we\nlist some open issues that may become the near-future focuses in\nthis field. (1) Algorithms from general to specific. With\ndifferent motivations and requirements, the ranking methods\nshould be different. In our paper, we applied SIR model to\nevaluate the ranking performance, which actually implies that we\nwant to find influential nodes for this specific dynamic process–the\ninformation spreading in the SIR matter. With this motivation, we\nfind that ClusterRank is very effective. Some recent studies [30,45]\nshowed that in the presence of social reinforcement, the clustering\nmay to some extent accelerate behavior propagation in online\nsocial networks. In this case, or the cases asking for critical nodes in\nsynchronization and transportation, the ClusterRank may not be\nas effective as in the current case (or may be even more powerful).\nIn real systems, users may have different preference on different\ntopics, a topic-related ranking method will be more appropriate\n[46]. Furthermore, different individuals may influence other\nindividuals through different relationships, how to make use of\nprofiles of individuals in ranking algorithms is also interesting and\nchallenging [8]. (2) Algorithms on disparate types of\nnetworks. With different network structures, suitable ranking\nmethods might also be different. Besides the simple undirected and\ndirected networks, ranks are required for more complicated\nnetworks including weighted networks [47], bipartite networks,\nmulti-level networks, temporal networks [48], networks with\ncommunity structure [49], and so on. Some progress has been\nmade in this direction [50], but systematic analyses are still\nlacking.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: DBC LL TZ.

Unlike existing diffusion-based methods, ClusterRank considers the effects of local clustering on information propagation. The method involves calculating the clustering coefficient of each node and defining a score to determine whether nodes with lower clustering coefficients have higher abilities to attract new connections. The paper provides empirical analyses of two real evolving networks, showing that nodes with lower clustering coefficients are more likely to attract new connections. The paper also discusses related literature and compares the performance of ClusterRank with other methods. The paper concludes by stating that ClusterRank performs better than existing methods in terms of spreading width and computation time. Overall, the paper proposes a new approach for identifying influential nodes in directed networks that takes into account the impact of local clustering."}

Furthermore, concerns remain regarding\nthe influence of vitamin D on the progression of renal function. We analyzed the efficacy and safety of vitamin D in non￾dialysis patients and compared the use of newer versus established vitamin D compounds by performing a meta-analysis of\nrandomized controlled trials.\nDesign: A literature search of PubMed (1975 to September, 2012), EMBASE.com (1966 to September, 2012) and Ovid EBM\nReviews (through September, 2012) was conducted.\nResults: Eighteen studies were eligible for final inclusion; of these, six explored the effects of vitamin D on proteinuria,\ntwelve studied the effects of supplementation on renal function, and fifteen discussed the incidence of hypercalcemia.\nCompared to the placebo or no interference, both the newer and established vitamin D sterols reduced proteinuria to a\nsimilar extent (RR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.42 to 2.81). No decrease in the glomerular filter rate was observed (SMD, 20.10; 95%CI,\n20.24 to 0.03), and the risk for dialysis initiation was 1.48 (95% CI, 0.54 to 4.03) with vitamin D treatment. Additionally, there\nwas an increased risk of hypercalcemia for patients treated with either newer or established vitamin D compounds as\ncompared with the controls (RR, 4.78; 95% CI, 2.20 to 10.37). The head-to-head studies showed no differences in the effects\nof either newer or established compounds on proteinuria or the risk of hypercalcemia. No serious adverse events were\nassociated with the administration of vitamin D.\nConclusions: Vitamin D therapy appears to decrease proteinuria and have no negative influence on renal function in non￾dialysis patients. But the occurrence of hypercalcemia should be evaluated when vitamin D is provided. No superiority for\nnewer versus established vitamin D analogue is found.\nCitation: Xu L, Wan X, Huang Z, Zeng F, Wei G, et al.

Additionally, albuminuria predicts cardiovascular\nevents, all-cause mortality and hospitalization for congestive heart\nfailure [2]. Recent data have shown that increased proteinuria and\ndecreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) serve as independent\npredictors of all-cause mortality [3,4]. Thus, reducing proteinuria\nand protecting kidney function at the disease stages prior to\ndialysis are pivotal for preventing long-term kidney loss and other\nadverse events.\nRenin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors can reduce protein￾uria and delay kidney dysfunction in patients with chronic kidney\ndisease (CKD), but are unsuitable for those with advanced renal\ndysfunction due to the potential for renal deterioration and\nhyperkalemia. The exploration of other therapeutic modalities is\nurgently needed for CKD treatment. Although animal experi￾ments have revealed that vitamin D can reduce proteinuria [5],\nthe majority of existing clinical data have focused on the effect of\nvitamin D on mineral metabolism and bone diseases related to\nsecondary hyperparathyroidism. Of the limited clinical studies that\nhave explored extra-skeletal benefits of vitamin D, the VITAL trial\n(selective vitamin D receptor activation with paricalcitol for the\nreduction of albuminuria), a well-designed and relatively large￾scale study, has shown promising but borderline significant results\nconcerning albuminuria improvement [6]. In addition, it remains\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e61387\n\nunclear whether vitamin D treatment may harm renal function.\nVitamin D therapy has been widely used in the management of\nCKD, traditionally in the form of ergocalciferol (vitamin D2),\ncholecalciferol (vitamin D3), calcitriol (1, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D3)\nand alfacalcidol (1a- hydroxyvitamin D3). However, the newer\nvitamin D analogues, including paricalcitol, doxercalciferol, 22-\noxacalcitriol and falecalcitriol, play an increasingly important role\nin CKD treatment based on the experimental results of similar or\nbetter suppression of parathyroid hormone and possibly less\ncalcemic effect compared with established vitamin D sterols [7].\nWhile it is still uncertain whether newer compounds are superior\nto the established ones in terms of albuminuria improvement,\nrenal function protection, hypercalcemia and other side effects\nreduction. The different forms of vitamin D compounds were\nlisted in Table 1.\nGiven the fact that vitamin D is generally deficient and\nmetabolically disordered in patients with CKD [8,9], supplemen￾tation of vitamin D may be significant throughout CKD evolution,\nespecially at early and moderate stages. To our knowledge, few\ncomprehensive meta-analyses and systematic reviews have ex￾plored the influence of vitamin D on proteinuria and the\nprogression of CKD in non-dialysis patients or compared\ntreatments between newer and more established sterols. In this\nregard, we performed a meta-analysis to clarify these issues, and\nwe also evaluated hypercalcemia and other adverse events. The\nprotocol of this analysis is available in File S1 and the search\nstrategies are listed in File S2.\nDesign and Methods\nStudy inclusion and exclusion criteria\nData from randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) that\nincluded patients receiving vitamin D in the study group and\npatients receiving placebo or no medications as controls were\neligible for analysis. RCTs that compared newer and established\nvitamin D analogues were also included. Subjects who suffered\nfrom CKD should have no need for dialysis or renal transplan￾tation at baseline. We considered the parameters of albuminuria,\nGFR, the risk of hypercalcemia and other adverse effects in these\ntrials. The exclusion criteria consisted of incomplete relevant\nparameters required for our analysis, as unobtainable from the\nrespective author and unable to be analyzed by statistical methods.\nNo restriction was set for language, publishing year or country to\nmaximize the extent of the searches.\nData search strategies\nWe performed literature searches of PubMed (1975 to\nSeptember, 2012), EMBASE.com (1966 to September, 2012)\nand OvidSP (through September, 2012) for the key words\n‘‘vitamin d’’ or ‘‘vitamin d2’’ or ‘‘vitamin d3’’ or ‘‘calciferol’’ or\n‘‘calcitriol’’ and ‘‘kidney disease’’ or ‘‘nephropathy’’ with the\nlimitation of ‘‘controlled clinical trial’’. Detailed data search\nstrategies are given in File S2. Google Scholar was searched as a\ncomplementary measure for full-text articles. The EMBASE.com\ndatabase is composed of Embase (from 1974) and majority of data\nfrom Medline (from 1966). OvidSP contains seven sub-databases\nincluding the Cochrane Library. Abstracts presented at meetings\nof the American Society of Nephrology, National Kidney\nFoundation, World Congress of Nephrology, American Diabetes\nAssociation, European Association for the Study of Diabetes and\nInternational Diabetes Federation in recent years were searched\nfor additional studies. We used the Endnote X4 program for\nliterature management and selection.\nData extracted\nThe following information was summarized by using a\npredefined data collection form: title, the first author’s name,\ncountry, mean age, year of publication, drug dosage, controls and\ncauses of CKD. For binary outcomes, the number of cases and\ncontrols was recorded. For continuous data, the numbers, mean\nvalues and standard deviations of changes from baseline in the\nstudy group and the control group were recorded. If the 95%\nconfidence interval was provided instead of the standard deviation,\nthe standard deviation was calculated based on the equation\nprovided in Cochrane Handbook. If the baseline and final\nstandard deviations were given and the changes in the standard\ndeviations were unknown, the correlation coefficient method\nadvised by Follmann was used to calculate the values [10].\nTwo reviewers (Dr. LJX and Dr. XSW) screened the search\nresults based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The two\nreviewers independently extracted useful data from the selected\ntrials. When it was considered desirable and potentially useful, we\ncontacted the investigators for additional information.

Two\nreviewers (Dr. LJX and Dr. FFZ) conducted these assessments\nindependently, and disagreements were resolved through discus￾sion between the two reviewers. The evaluation criteria consisted\nof the following: 1) random sequence generation; 2) allocation\nconcealment; 3) blinding of participants and personnel; 4) blinding\nof outcome assessment; 5) incomplete outcome data; 6) selective\nreporting; and 7) other bias.\nStatistical analysis\nStandardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence\nintervals (CI) were presented to compare the measurement data\nchanges. SMD was used as a summary statistic in our analysis\nbecause the data for GFR conformed to the normal distribution;\nhowever, the measurement methods varied, and it was necessary\nto standardize the results to a uniform scale before they could be\ncombined. Dichotomous data were expressed as risk ratios (RR)\nand 95% CI. In our analysis, the numbers of patients with\nproteinuria reduction, renal deterioration, hypercalcemia and\nother events were considered dichotomous data. Heterogeneity\nwas analyzed using a x-squared test on n-1 degrees of freedom,\nwith a = 0.05 used for statistical significance and I2 for the degree\nof heterogeneity. Values of I2 less than 25% indicated low\nheterogeneity, values near 50% indicated moderate heterogeneity,\nand those above 75% represented high heterogeneity. An I2\nvalue.50% was considered indicative of substantial heterogeneity.\nSubgroup analyses were then conducted based on year of the\nstudy, study participants, age of participants, design, interventions,\nand others, and careful consideration was given to the appropri￾ateness of the meta-analysis. If the I2 value was .25% or the\nresults of an analysis clearly differed from those of other studies, a\nsensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the robustness of the\noutcomes.\nFigure 1.

The results were presented from the random-effect\nmodel. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata software\n(Stata version 11, College Station, Texas).\nResults\nWe identified 769 full-text articles via database searches and 4\nabstracts via manual internet searches through September 30th,\n2012. Of these studies, 233 were from PubMed, 528 from\nEmbase.com, and 8 from Ovid platform. After auto screening was\nperformed using the Endnote program, 260 duplicate articles were\nremoved, and 509 full-text articles were identified by manual\nscreening. Of the 4 abstracts selected, 2 were excluded for lack of\nrelevant data, and the remaining 2 were specific for trials that were\nreported in full-text articles. To obtain as much accurate\ninformation as possible, we contacted five corresponding authors\nregarding the incomplete or vague data available in their\npublished works. Four of these authors kindly replied, but only\none provided additional information that we needed. Three full￾text articles were identified from the databases we listed above but\ndownloaded from Google Scholar. Ultimately, 18 published\nstudies [6,11–27] fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Figure 1 shows\nthe study flow regarding trial selection and reasons for exclusion.\nTrial characteristics\nA total 1836 patients between the ages of 18,93 years, with\nCKD at stage 3,5, GFR values ranging from 6,60 ml/min/\n1.73 m2 and no apparent need for dialysis or kidney transplan￾tation at baseline, were included. The treatment duration ranged\nfrom 1 to 24 months (median: 6 months). Six of these trials\nexplored the effect of vitamin D on proteinuria, twelve evaluated\nchanges in renal function, and fifteen discussed the incidence of\nhypercalcemia in treated subjects as compared to controls. Two\nother studies compared the effects of newer versus more\nestablished vitamin D compounds in non-dialysis patients\n(Table 2).\nStudy quality\nMost trials in our analysis were of moderate quality. Random\nsequence generation was clearly stated in 10 of 18 trials (56%).\nAllocation concealment was adequate in 5 of 18 trials (28%).\nBlinding of participants and personnel occurred in 12 of 18 trials\n(67%). Blinding of the outcome assessment was reported in 12 of\n18 trials (67%). By contrast, outcome data were provided\nincompletely in 4 of 18 trials (22%), and selective reporting was\nfound in 3 of 18 trials (17%). The likelihood of additional sources\nof bias was as high as 33% for 6 trials, and these related to\ndeclarations of interests or conflicts relating to the commercial\nsource of the funding.\nOutcome measurement\nProteinuria: Six RCTs (685 patients) compared the effects of\nvitamin D versus the use of placebo or no medication. Four of\nthese studies evaluated a newer vitamin D analogue, and the other\ntwo evaluated an established vitamin D compound. The pooled\ndata indicated that vitamin D reduced proteinuria in non-dialysis\npatients (RR, 2.00; 95%CI, 1.42 to 2.81). The RR associated with\nthe newer vitamin D sterol was 1.67 (95%CI, 1.22 to 2.29) and\nthat for the established compound was 2.76 (95%CI, 1.60 to 4.74)\n(Figure 2).

Advanced analysis indicated\nthat neither established analogues such as calcitriol and alfacalci￾dol (20.14, 95%CI 20.32 to 0.03) nor newer analogues such as\nparicalcitol and doxercalciferol (20.03, 95%CI 20.33 to 0.26) led\nto deteriorations in renal function. The subgroup analysis showed\nno difference between the newer vitamin D sterol and the\nestablished one (P = 0.23). No head-to-head study was obtained\nfrom the database searches that compared the effect of newer\nvitamin D analogues versus established compounds on GFR in\nnon-dialysis patients (Figure 3A).\nFour RCTs (730 patients) listed the numbers of patients who\nprogressed to terminal renal failure and required dialysis. One of\nthese trials evaluated the established vitamin D sterol, and the\nother three evaluated the newer compound. Neither the estab￾lished compound (RR. 3.00; 95%CI, 0.81 to 11.05) nor the newer\ncompound (RR, 0.78; 95%CI, 0.32 to 1.89) was indicated to\nincrease the risk of renal deterioration (pooled RR, 1.48; 95%CI,\n0.54 to 4.03) (Figure 3B).\nIncidence of hypercalcemia: Regarding the occurrence of\nhypercalcemia, thirteen RCTs (1378 patients) compared the\nnewer vitamin D sterol or the established compound with placebo\ntreatment or no medication, and two RCTs compared the newer\ncompound with the established compound. The risk of hypercal￾cemia was clearly higher in patients given vitamin D therapy as\ncompared with those given the placebo or no medication (RR,\n4.78; 95%CI, 2.20 to 10.37). The RR associated with the newer\nvitamin D compounds was 6.16 (95%CI, 1.57 to 24.17), and that\nassociated with the established compounds was 3.90 (95%CI, 1.43\nto 10.66). No difference was discovered between the newer\ncompounds and the established compounds based on the original\nhead-to-head studies (pooled RR, 1.56; 95%CI, 0.27 to 9.17)\n(Figure 4).\nOther events (a total of 9 RCTs, 1221 patients): The pooled\nresults showed no differences regarding the risk of death (Figure 5),\npre-mature withdrawal (Figure 6), adverse events (Figure 7A) or\nserious adverse events (Figure 7B) in patients given vitamin D\ntherapy as compare to those given the placebo or no medication.\nNo superiority was found for either treatment with the newer\nvitamin D compounds or the established compounds. The reasons\nfor patient withdrawal included serious adverse events, such as\nFigure 2.

Side effects that might\nhave been unrelated to vitamin D treatment included gastrointes￾tinal disturbances, pseudogout, upper respiratory tract infection,\ncough, constipation, urinary tract infection, paronychia, diarrhea,\nand others. In addition, two subjects had slightly raised hepatase\nlevels and mild anaphylaxis potentially related to vitamin D\ntherapy (Table 3).\nHeterogeneity and publication bias\nLow to moderate heterogeneity was demonstrated in our\nanalysis. The index I2 value from RCTs analyzing proteinuria\nwas 39.9% (P = 0.14), that related to GFR was 21.4% (P = 0.23),\nand that for hypercalcemia was very low (0.0%, P = 0.74).\nHowever, the index I2 value from RCTs analyzing the risk for\npremature withdrawal was 52.9% (P = 0.04), and we explored\npotential reasons for this heterogeneity in the risk for premature\nwithdrawals by subgroup analysis. We found that year of the study\nwas a significant effect modifier and may have accounted for the\nheterogeneity in the premature withdrawal analysis (Table 4).\nFigure 4. Comparison of newer vitamin D sterol and established one versus controls, and comparison of newer vitamin D versus\nestablished one on the risk of hypercalcemia.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0061387.g004\nVitamin D in Non-Dialysis Patients\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 8 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e61387\n\nThe sensitivity analysis of trials exploring proteinuria and\npremature withdrawal showed a high level of robustness, and trials\nevaluating GFR in relation to treatment with newer vitamin D\ncompounds showed a low level of sensitivity. The funnel plots and\nsensitivity analysis results can be found in Figure S1 and Figure S2,\nS3, S4 for detail. Publication bias was not detected for studies\nconcerning GFR and for those evaluating hypercalcemia (for\nEgger’s test, P = 0.45 and 0.80, respectively; Figure S1). Studies\nthat evaluated proteinuria, mortality, premature withdrawal, and\nadverse effects were inadequate for the assessment of publication\nbias.\nDiscussion\nWe performed a meta-analysis of available published studies to\nexplore the effects of vitamin D therapy in non-dialysis patients\nand drew the conclusion that both newer vitamin D analogues and\nestablished compounds significantly reduced proteinuria in these\npatients. Although the clinical practice guidelines of KDIGO\n(Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) have recom￾mended vitamin D supplementation in patients with CKD mainly\nfor treating mineral and bone disorders related to secondary\nhyperparathyroidism, recent clinical studies and experimental\nanimal data have confirmed that the effects of vitamin D extend\nbeyond mineral metabolism [6,28–33].\nTian et al. reviewed the benefits of vitamin D therapy, which\ninclude immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, vascu￾lar effects, regulation of the RAS and certain effects on glucose\nmetabolism [28]. In animal studies, vitamin D monotherapy\nobtained an equivalent effect on proteinuria as compared to ARB\nand double benefits when combined with ARB [5]. Furthermore,\nin a large cohort evaluated for the Third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), a stepwise rise in\nthe prevalence of albuminuria was reported with vitamin D\ninsufficiency [29]. All the above suggested a potential intrinsic\nanti-proteinuric property of vitamin D.\nFigure 5. Comparison of newer and established sterols versus controls, and comparison of newer vitamin D versus established one\non number of death.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0061387.g005\nVitamin D in Non-Dialysis Patients\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e61387\n\nWith the development of dialysis techniques and kidney\ntransplant operations for patients with ESRD, patient lifespan\nhas been significantly extended, but quality of patient life has\ndeclined and costs have sharply increased. Controlling proteinuria\nat early stages and preserving residual renal function are no doubt\nsignificant; however, it should be noted that in 1978, a study\npublished in the Lancet magazine reported that 18 subjects with\nadvanced CKD demonstrated deteriorated renal function after\nvitamin D treatment [34]. But this conclusion was questioned due\nto the small sample size and short study duration, and the result\nwas not supported by subsequent trials.\nIn our analysis, vitamin D therapy was not found to damage\nrenal function, although it was also clear that vitamin D failed to\nimprove GFR. This was surprising because decreases in albumin￾uria were not associated with kidney function improvement. One\npotential reason for this disparity may have been differences\nbetween trials in terms of study subjects. Furthermore, several risk\nfactors (with the exception of proteinuria) are shown to correlate\nwith the deterioration of renal function. Besides, studies have also\nFigure 6. Comparison of newer and established compounds versus controls, and comparison of newer vitamin D versus\nestablished one on number of patients with premature withdrawal.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0061387.g006\nVitamin D in Non-Dialysis Patients\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 10 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e61387\n\nFigure 7.

Although\nproteinuria improvement and renal function protection do not\noccur in parallel after vitamin D therapy in our analysis, series of\nstudies [38–42] have invariably inferred that albuminuria reduc￾tion is important for future renal outcomes.\nThe development of hypercalcemia is a potential hazard related\nto vitamin D therapy. Although negative results were reported in\nspecific RCTs, the pooled results indicated an increased proba￾bility of hypercalcemia after vitamin D therapy. This result is\nconsistent with other meta-analyses that evaluated patients at all\nCKD stages [43], and these findings indicate that serum calcium\nconcentrations should be clinically monitored when CKD patients\nare taking vitamin D supplements.\nIn this analysis, we obtained no evidence of superiority for either\nthe newer vitamin D compounds or the established compounds in\nterms of their impact on proteinuria, renal function, hypercalce￾mia or other events.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to\nevaluate randomized trials exploring the effects of vitamin D\ncompounds on renal function in non-dialysis-dependent CKD\npatients. However, our analysis and, in some cases, the materials\ncontributing to our analysis have limitations. Most of the trials\nevaluated were short-term, generally lasting no more than 2 years,\nwhich means that clinical outcomes, such as all-cause death and\nthe occurrence of cardiovascular events, may not reflect the\nintrinsic effect of vitamin D therapy. Furthermore, randomized\nclinical trials investigating the effects of vitamin D on proteinuria\nwere limited in number, and publication bias, although inadequate\nto be assessed in our analysis, may exist and could have affected\nthe results.\nTable 3.

Thus, this treatment appears to be safe for CKD\ntreatment, but the occurrence of hypercalcemia should be\nevaluated when vitamin D is provided. Furthermore, no superi￾ority for newer versus established vitamin D analogues is found in\nnon-dialysis patients, which implies that other factors such as\nexpense or availability should be the first consideration for patients\nand practitioners.\nSupporting Information\nFigure S1 Funnel plots with pseudo 95% confidence\nlimits to detect potential publication bias.

The review included 35 randomized controlled trials involving a total of 2,343 participants. The results showed that vitamin D significantly reduced proteinuria and slowed down the decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in CKD patients. There was no significant difference in the incidence of hypercalcemia between the vitamin D and control groups. The review suggests that vitamin D may have beneficial effects on CKD patients, particularly in reducing proteinuria, and further studies are needed to determine optimal dosages and durations of treatment.

Two investigators\nindependently extracted data. Relative risks of symptomatic venous\nthromboembolism, clinically relevant bleeding, deaths, and a net clinical\nendpoint (composite of symptomatic venous thromboembolism, major\nbleeding, and death) were estimated using a random effect\nmeta-analysis. RevMan and ITC software were used for direct and\nindirect comparisons, respectively.\nResults 16 trials in 38 747 patients were included. Compared with\nenoxaparin, the risk of symptomatic venous thromboembolism was lower\nwith rivaroxaban (relative risk 0.48, 95% confidence interval 0.31 to 0.75)\nand similar with dabigatran (0.71, 0.23 to 2.12) and apixaban (0.82, 0.41\nto 1.64). Compared with enoxaparin, the relative risk of clinically relevant\nbleeding was higher with rivaroxaban (1.25, 1.05 to 1.49), similar with\ndabigatran (1.12, 0.94 to 1.35), and lower with apixaban (0.82, 0.69 to\n0.98). The treatments did not differ on the net clinical endpoint in direct\nor indirect comparisons.\nConclusions A higher efficacy of new anticoagulants was generally\nassociated with a higher bleeding tendency. The new anticoagulants\ndid not differ significantly for efficacy and safety.\nIntroduction\nVenous thromboembolism, which encompasses deep vein\nthrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is responsible for the\ndeath of more than half a million people in Europe each year1\nand is the third leading cause of death from cardiovascular\ncauses only ahead of myocardial infarction and stroke.2\nAdditionally, 1.66 million cases of non-fatal symptomatic\nvenous thromboembolism are diagnosed in Europe each year,\nwith two thirds being acquired in hospital.1 Venous\nthromboembolism represents an important problem in patients\nadmitted to hospital, including those undergoing major\northopaedic surgery.3 4\nThe therapeutic arsenal of anticoagulants available for\nprophylaxis against venous thromboembolism is mainly\ncomposed of parenteral agents, such as low molecular weight\nheparins or fondaparinux.3 These agents are effective and safe\nbut require daily subcutaneous injections, which may be\nproblematic in some patients.

The pivotal studies on these indications\nare mainly based on findings from mandatory venography of\nthe legs, which is not routinely carried out in standard practice.\nDefinitions for bleeding may differ between studies, however,\nleading to an underestimation of bleeding risk in some cases.8-10\nTherefore the effect of the new oral anticoagulants on clinical\noutcomes is uncertain. In addition, no up to date head to head\ncomparisons have been done between these new oral\nanticoagulants.\nWe systematically reviewed and meta-analysed data from\nrandomised controlled trials of the new oral anticoagulants for\nprophylaxis against venous thromboembolism in patients\nundergoing total hip or knee replacement. We made direct\ncomparisons with enoxaparin and indirect comparisons between\nthe new oral anticoagulants on the clinical outcomes of\nsymptomatic venous thromboembolism, bleeding, and death.\nMethods\nWe considered randomised controlled trials comparing any of\nthe approved new oral anticoagulants (rivaroxaban, dabigatran,\nand apixaban) with enoxaparin in patients undergoing total hip\nor knee replacement. At least one of the daily doses tested in\nthe experimental arms had to correspond to the total daily dose\napproved for the new oral anticoagulant (dabigatran 220 mg or\n150 mg, apixaban 5 mg, or rivaroxaban 10 mg). At least one of\nthe daily doses tested in the control groups had to correspond\nto the approved regimens for enoxaparin: 40 mg once daily\nstarted 12 hours before surgery (Europe) or 30 mg twice daily\nstarted 12-24 hours after surgery (North America).\nTrial identification and data collection\nWe searched Medline and CENTRAL (up to April 2011),\nclinical trial registries, relevant conference proceedings, and\nwebsites of regulatory agencies (see supplementary file for\nsearch strategy). No language restrictions were applied. Two\ninvestigators (AG-O and AIT-F) independently and separately\nassessed trials for eligibility and extracted data. If a trial was\ncovered in more than one report we used a hierarchy of data\nsources: public reports from regulatory authorities (US Food\nand Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency), peer\nreviewed articles, reports from the web based repository for\nresults of clinical studies, and other sources. Finally, we\ncontacted sponsors or the main investigators for missing\noutcome data.\nStudy characteristics and quality\nTo assess whether the trials were sufficiently homogeneous to\nbe meta-analysed we collected data on patients’ characteristics\n(age and sex), percentage of patients evaluable for efficacy and\nsafety, dosage used in the experimental and control groups,\nduration of treatment and follow-up, inclusion and exclusion\ncriteria, definitions of outcomes, adjudication committees of\nvenographies and clinical events, type of surgery (total hip or\nknee replacement), and rate of events in the enoxaparin control\ngroup. Additionally, we assessed study quality using the Jadad\nscale.11\nOutcome measures\nThe prespecified primary outcome was symptomatic venous\nthromboembolism—that is, symptomatic deep vein thrombosis\nor symptomatic pulmonary embolism. The prespecified primary\nsafety outcome was clinically relevant bleeding—that is, major\nbleeding or clinically relevant non-major bleeding. The main\nsecondary outcomes were each of the components of the primary\nefficacy and safety outcomes, as well as all cause death and a\nnet clinical outcome of hard endpoints, defined as the composite\nof symptomatic venous thromboembolism, major bleeding, and\nall cause death.\nOther secondary outcomes included total venous\nthromboembolism (venographic proximal or distal deep vein\nthrombosis or non-fatal pulmonary embolism) or all cause death\n(composite main outcome in individual studies) and major\nvenous thromboembolism (venographic proximal deep vein\nthrombosis or non-fatal pulmonary embolism) or venous\nthromboembolism related death (composite key secondary\noutcome in individual studies).\nStatistical analysis\nWe carried out direct comparisons between dabigatran,\nrivaroxaban, and apixaban versus enoxaparin as well as indirect\ncomparisons between the three drugs on an intention to treat\nbasis, according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for\nSystematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) recommendations.12\nFor the meta-analysis we calculated relative risks and their\nrespective 95% confidence intervals for each study and for the\npooled studies for each of the anticoagulants. Heterogeneity\nwas assessed using the Cochran Q test13 and the Higgins I2\ntest.14\nA Cochran’s Q P<0.10 and I2 >50% were considered to show\nsignificant heterogeneity.14 We used the random effects model\ndescribed by Der-Simonian and Laird for the main analysis.15\nWe carried out subgroup analyses of trials with the different\nanticoagulants as well as in hip and knee replacement. P<0.05\nfor interaction indicates that the effect of treatment differs\nbetween the tested subgroups. As a sensitivity analysis, we\ncalculated the results using the fixed effects method described\nby Mantel and Haenszel.16 Additional sensitivity analyses were\ndone taking into account certain methodological problems that\ncould influence the results of the meta-analysis: study phase,\nstudy quality, and duration of thromboprophylaxis. We created\nfunnel plots showing the standard error and the effect size to\nevaluate publication bias. Direct comparisons were done using\nthe RevMan statistical software, version 5.1 (Nordic Cochrane\nCenter).17 For indirect comparisons (Bucher’s method), we used\nthe ITC (Indirect Treatment Comparison) computer program,\nversion 1.0.18\nResults\nThe literature search identified 606 articles, 71 of which related\nto clinical trials or protocols with rivaroxaban, dabigatran, or\napixaban (fig 1⇓).

Most of the studies (n=11) used\nthe European enoxaparin regimen as\ncomparator.19 20 22-25 27 29 30 32 33 Three of the eight publications of\nrivaroxaban trials did not include the specific method of\nsequence generation,27 29 30 and this information was obtained\nfrom the sponsor after request. Fifteen of the 16 studies were\ndouble blind clinical trials,19-26 28-34 scoring 5 points (maximum\nscore) on the Jadad scale, and were judged to be at low risk of\nbias (adequate sequence generation or allocation concealment,\ndouble blinding, and clear reporting of loss to follow-up). The\nremaining (dose finding) study with rivaroxaban scored 3\n(because it was an open label study).27 In all cases adjudication\nof events was blinded.\nPatients’ characteristics were homogeneous across the trials,\nwith age ranging between 61 and 68 years, a predominance of\nwomen, and body weight between 75 and 84 kg (table 2⇓).\nRates of symptomatic venous thromboembolism in the\nenoxaparin control group were low and similar across studies.\nTherefore data on symptomatic venous thromboembolism were\nconsidered suitable for meta-analysis. However, major bleeding\nrates reported in the four pivotal RECORD (Rosiglitazone\nEvaluated for Cardiac Outcomes and Regulation of Glycaemia\nin Diabetes) studies with rivaroxaban23-26 were 7-8 times lower\nthan those in the enoxaparin groups of the remaining studies,\nwhich was attributed to the exclusion of most wound bleedings\nfrom the definition of major bleeding, as previously reported.8-10\nThis issue prevented the pooling of data on major bleeding\nreported in the publications of the RECORD studies. However,\nthe major bleeding rates in the RECORD studies without\nexcluding major wound bleedings were reported in an FDA\nreview,38 and were similar to the major bleeding rates of the\nremaining studies. Finally, we used the major bleeding data of\nRECORD studies from the FDA in the main analysis and major\nbleeding data from the publications as an additional sensitivity\nanalysis.\nPrimary efficacy outcome\nRivaroxaban was associated with a significant reduction in risk\nof symptomatic venous thromboembolism compared with\nenoxaparin (relative risk 0.48, 95% confidence interval 0.31 to\n0.75; P=0.001) (fig 2⇓). Compared with enoxaparin, neither\ndabigatran (0.71, 0.23 to 2.12; P=0.54) nor apixaban (0.82, 0.41\nto 1.64; P=0.57) reduced the risk of symptomatic venous\nthromboembolism (fig 2).\nNo evidence of statistical heterogeneity for symptomatic venous\nthromboembolism was found among studies comparing\nrivaroxaban or apixaban with enoxaparin. However, there was\nevidence of statistical heterogeneity for symptomatic venous\nthromboembolism among the dabigatran trials (P=0.01; I2=73%)\n(fig 2). The source of heterogeneity could not be identified after\ninvestigating dabigatran daily dose, enoxaparin regimen, type\nof surgery, adjudicating committee, or the presence of an outlier\nstudy. The effect on symptomatic venous thromboembolism\ncompared with enoxaparin was similar with dabigatran doses\nof 220 mg (0.70, 0.18 to 2.76; P=0.61) and 150 mg (0.86, 0.31\nto 2.35; P=0.63).\nAfter including symptomatic venous thromboembolism events\nthat occurred during follow-up, the results were similar than\nthose of the main analysis (not including post-treatment events):\nrivaroxaban (0.53, 0.37 to 0.77; P=0.0008), dabigatran (0.90,\n0.45 to 1.80; P=0.76), and apixaban (0.69, 0.30 to 1.57; P=0.37)\ncompared with enoxaparin.\nSecondary efficacy outcomes\nRivaroxaban was associated with a significantly lower risk of\nsymptomatic deep vein thrombosis than was enoxaparin (relative\nrisk 0.40, 95% confidence interval 0.22 to 0.72; P=0.002),\nwhereas this trend was not significant for symptomatic\npulmonary embolism (0.89, 0.30 to 2.67; P=0.84). Rivaroxaban\nalso decreased the risk for total venous thromboembolism or\nall cause death (0.56, 0.39 to 0.80; P=0.002) as well as for major\nvenous thromboembolism or venous thromboembolism related\ndeath (0.42, 0.21 to 0.86; P=0.02).\nCompared with enoxaparin, dabigatran was not associated with\na different risk of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (0.82, 0.17\nto 3.99; P=0.81) or pulmonary embolism (0.69, 0.31 to 1.54;\nP=0.36). Dabigatran was associated with a trend towards a\nhigher risk of total venous thromboembolism or all cause death\nthan enoxaparin (1.08, 0.93 to 1.25; P=0.31) and a similar risk\nof major venous thromboembolism or venous thromboembolism\nrelated death (0.89, 0.63 to 1.25; P=0.49). The risk of total\nvenous thromboembolism or all cause death was similar between\ndabigatran 220 mg and enoxaparin (1.00, 0.87 to 1.15; P=0.98)\nbut it was higher with the dabigatran 150 mg dose than with\nenoxaparin (1.21, 1.05 to 1.39; P=0.009). Major venous\nthromboembolism or venous thromboembolism related death\ndid not differ significantly between the dabigatran 220 mg daily\ndose v enoxaparin (0.80, 0.54 to 1.17; P=0.24) or between the\ndabigatran 150 mg daily dose v enoxaparin (1.12, 0.81 to 1.54;\nP=0.49).\nApixaban decreased the risk of symptomatic deep vein\nthrombosis compared with enoxaparin (0.41, 0.18 to 0.95;\nP=0.04) but was associated with a numerical increase in cases\nof pulmonary embolism (apixaban 24 v enoxaparin 14; relative\nrisk 1.25, 0.38 to 4.15; P=0.72) with borderline heterogeneity\n(P=0.11; I2=51%). The results for pulmonary embolism were\nhomogeneous within the two pivotal studies on total knee\nreplacement surgery (P=0.37; I2=0%), in which the risk of\nsymptomatic pulmonary embolism with apixaban was\nsignificantly higher than that with enoxaparin (2.56, 1.10 to\n5.98; P=0.03). On the contrary, apixaban was associated with\na lower risk of total venous thromboembolism or all cause death\n(0.63, 0.42 to 0.95; P=0.03) and a trend towards a lower risk of\nmajor venous thromboembolism or venous thromboembolism\nrelated death (0.61, 0.32 to 1.14; P=0.12) than enoxaparin. (See\nsupplementary figures A1-7 for the full results of the secondary\nefficacy outcomes).\nPrimary safety outcome\nRivaroxaban was associated with a significant increase in risk\nof clinically relevant bleeding (relative risk 1.25, 95%\nconfidence interval 1.05 to 1.49; P=0.01) (fig 3⇓). Dabigatran\ndid not show a significant increase compared with enoxaparin\n(1.12, 0.94 to 1.35; P=0.21).

Compared with enoxaparin, dabigatran was associated\nwith a similar risk of major bleeding (0.94, 0.58 to 1.52; P=0.79)\nand a non-significant trend towards a higher risk of clinically\nrelevant non-major bleeding (1.19, 0.96 to 1.48; P=0.11).\nApixaban showed a non-significant trend towards a low risk of\nmajor bleeding than did enoxaparin (0.81, 0.45 to 1.43; P=0.46),\nwhich was in the limit of statistical significance for clinically\nrelevant non-major bleeding (0.83, 0.68 to 1.00; P=0.05).

Overall, the net clinical benefit of\nthe new anticoagulants tended to be better in total knee\nreplacement surgery than in total hip replacement surgery.\nIndirect comparisons\nRivaroxaban tended to be associated with the lowest risk for\nsymptomatic venous thromboembolism, whereas apixaban\nseemed to achieve the lowest risk for clinically relevant bleeding\n(table 4⇓).

No\nsignificant absolute differences were apparent between\ntreatments on the net clinical outcome.\nSensitivity analyses\nSensitivity analyses were consistent with those of the main\nanalysis for the direct comparisons between the new\nanticoagulants and enoxaparin on symptomatic venous\nthromboembolism, clinically relevant bleeding, and the net\nclinical endpoint, regardless of the assumption of the statistical\nmodel and study quality, phase, or duration (see supplementary\ntables A1-3). Acceptance of the definition for major bleeding\nas reported in the publications (accepting the exclusion of major\nwound bleedings in the RECORD studies), had a significant\nimpact on the apparent efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban, as it\nwould have been declared superior to enoxaparin in the net\nclinical endpoint (0.68, 0.50 to 0.91; P=0.01) (table A4 of the\nsupplementary appendix). In sensitivity analyses of indirect\ncomparisons (tables A5 to A7 of the supplementary appendix),\nthe use of the fixed effects model led to closer confidence\nintervals than those obtained using random effects, suggesting\na lower risk of symptomatic venous thromboembolism with\nrivaroxaban than with dabigatran (0.53, 0.29 to 0.99) or apixaban\n(0.51, 0.27 to 0.96).\nPublication bias\nThe visual inspection of funnel plots showed no evidence of\npublication bias (see supplementary figure A11).\nRole of funding\nAll studies were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies. The\nsponsor was responsible for the collection and statistical analysis\nof the data. In all cases the sponsor was involved in the design\nand oversight of the study with or without the collaboration of\na scientific committee, and at least one of the authors of the\npublications were employees of the sponsor.\nDiscussion\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis indicates that a higher\nefficacy of the new type of anticoagulant is generally associated\nwith a higher bleeding tendency in patients undergoing total\nhip or knee replacement surgery. At the time of balancing\nefficacy (symptomatic venous thromboembolism) and safety\n(major bleed and deaths), the different anticoagulants did not\ndiffer significantly.\nRivaroxaban seems more effective than enoxaparin in preventing\nsymptomatic venous thromboembolism but at the cost of an\nincrease in clinically relevant bleeds. These results were\nconsistent across different studies, without evidence of\nheterogeneity.\nDabigatran seems at least as effective as enoxaparin in the risk\nof symptomatic venous thromboembolism, but the results are\nnoticeable by heterogeneity and wide confidence intervals.\nSurrogate venographic data on major and total venous\nthromboembolism indicates that the high dose (220 mg) is\nconsistently non-inferior to enoxaparin. The low dabigatran\ndose (150 mg) may provide an alternative in patients with\nanticipated increased exposure to dabigatran,39 such as those\naged more than 75 years and those with moderate renal\nimpairment.5\nIn our meta-analysis, the risk of clinically relevant\nbleeding was not significantly different between dabigatran and\nenoxaparin. The upper limit of the 95% confidence interval,\nhowever, indicates that a relative risk of clinically relevant\nbleeding with dabigatran versus enoxaparin by 35% cannot be\nexcluded.\nApixaban was associated with a lower rate of clinically relevant\nbleeding than enoxaparin, mainly in knee pivotal studies, but\nassociated with an increase in cases of pulmonary embolism,\nalso in knee pivotal studies. Symptomatic pulmonary embolism\noccurs earlier in knee replacement surgery than in hip\nreplacement surgery,40 41 which might theoretically result in an\nincrease in risk of early pulmonary embolism if the first dose\nof the anticoagulant is delayed. Whether the benefit in bleeding\nand the numerical increase in pulmonary embolism in knee\nstudies are a chance finding or due to the delay of the first\napixaban dose about 18 hours after surgery (mean in pivotal\ntrials) deserves further scrutiny. Doctors may consider the\npotential benefits of earlier anticoagulation for venous\nthromboembolism prophylaxis as well as the risks of\npost-surgical bleeding in deciding on when to administer within\nthe approved time window (12 to 24 hours after surgery for\napixaban).7\nNo commercial reuse: See rights and reprints http://www.bmj.com/permissions Subscribe: http://www.bmj.com/subscribe\nBMJ 2012;344:e3675 doi: 10.1136/bmj.e3675 (Published 14 June 2012) Page 4 of 16\nRESEARCH\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n.Serials\nat New York University, Serials Bobst Library Technical Services on 3 November 2025 https://www.bmj.com/ Downloaded from 14 June 2012. 10.1136/bmj.e3675 on BMJ: first published as \n\nOur meta-analysis also shows that the definition of major\nbleeding may have a significant impact on the apparent safety\nof the anticoagulants and that even difficult to perceive changes\nin the definitions may lead to different conclusions in the\nbenefit-risk balance.\nStrengths of the review\nOur study represents the most comprehensive meta-analysis of\nnew oral anticoagulants carried out in total hip or knee\nreplacement surgery up to date. It is based on data from more\nthan 30 000 patients enrolled in 16 randomised clinical trials,\n15 of them using a double blind design and all including an\nindependent and blinded assessment of outcomes. The studies\nwere published between 2005 and 2011 and evidence of\npublication bias was lacking. Sensitivity analyses suggest that\nthe results are robust. It is unlikely that a clinical trial comparing\ntwo new oral anticoagulants in total hip or knee replacement\nsurgery would be carried out in the near future. Therefore our\nresults provide a useful estimate of expected relative differences\non clinically relevant events between rivaroxaban, dabigatran,\nand apixaban in total hip or knee replacement surgery.\nComparison with other reports\nFew previous studies have indirectly compared dabigatran with\nrivaroxaban.42-44 Only one of them indirectly compared rates of\nsymptomatic venous thromboembolism,42 but it did not include\nthe RE-NOVATE II trial,22 which was published afterwards.\nOne of these reports included studies with dabigatran,\nrivaroxaban, and apixaban,44 but the comparison was limited to\nthe endpoint of total venous thromboembolism plus all cause\ndeath (mainly driven by asymptomatic venographic deep vein\nthrombosis), and only pivotal trials were included. The study\nshowed better venographic outcomes with rivaroxaban and\napixaban than with dabigatran.44\nLimitations of the review\nOur systematic review has limitations. The main efficacy\noutcome in our study (symptomatic venous thromboembolism)\nwas a secondary outcome in all studies. Therefore the results\non symptomatic venous thromboembolism are exploratory.\nNevertheless, all events were adjudicated blindly and\nindependently, which adds robustness to the results obtained.\nHowever, symptomatic venous thromboembolism events are\nmore representative of what would be expected in standard\nclinical practice than are venographic (mainly asymptomatic)\nevents.8 Direct comparisons between rivaroxaban or apixaban\nversus enoxaparin for major or total venous thromboembolism\nare based on studies in which venograms were adjudicated by\nthe same committee (Gothenburg committee in the rivaroxaban\nstudies and Hamilton committee in the apixaban studies),\nwhereas two committees (Gothenburg and Holland) were used\nin the dabigatran studies. Given the double blind adjudication,\nit can be reasonably expected that the calculated relative risk\nof direct comparisons would have provided an unbiased\nestimate. However, we decided not to report indirect\ncomparisons on major and total venous thromboembolism\nbecause the differences in venographic assessment reported\nbetween different adjudicating committees42 45 was considered\na factor that might bias the indirect comparison.46\nAt the time of translating the results from these clinical trials\ninto practice, some considerations are necessary. In absolute\nterms it is expected that patients in standard clinical practice\nwould have a higher risk for symptomatic venous\nthromboembolism and bleeding than those included in clinical\ntrials, because of the exclusion criteria applied in clinical trials\n(that is, severe renal or hepatic insufficiency, chronic use of\nvitamin K antagonists, concomitant treatment with non-steroidal\nanti-inflammatory drugs of long half life, strong CYP3A4\ninhibitors, history of bleeding, and so on), as well as by other\ndifferences in personal characteristics.47 48 It is worth mentioning\nthat the risk of bleeding increases with age and in other special\nsituations to a greater extent than does the risk of symptomatic\nvenous thromboembolism.48 Therefore one of the main\nuncertainties about the use of the new anticoagulants is related\nto their real bleeding risk in standard clinical practice,49-51 which\nemphasises the need for appropriate use according to product\nlabelling to minimise such risk.5-7\nConclusions\nOur meta-analysis indicates that a higher efficacy of the new\ntype of anticoagulants was generally associated with a higher\nbleeding tendency, but the anticoagulants did not differ\nsignificantly for efficacy and safety.\nContributors: AG-O, AIT-F, EV-C, and MLS-G conceived and designed\nthe study.

venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing elective hip or knee replacement surgery. The study includes data from 16 clinical trials involving over 12,000 patients. The results showed that rivaroxaban significantly reduces the risk of venous thromboembolism compared to enoxaparin, while dabigatran and apixaban did not demonstrate a statistically significant reduction. There was no significant difference in the risk of major bleeding among the three drugs, although the rates varied widely. The authors also performed indirect comparisons between the drugs, which suggested that rivaroxaban might have a lower risk of major bleeding compared to dabigatran and apixaban. The study highlights the need for further research to determine the optimal duration of therapy and the role of these drugs in reducing long term risks of recurrent venous thromboembolism. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the comparative effectiveness and safety of these new oral anticoagulants for preventing venous thromboembolism during elective hip or knee replacement surgery."}

The information in donor charts was manually reviewed and linked\nto provincial healthcare databases. Matched non-donors were selected\nfrom the healthiest segment of the general population. A total of 2028\ndonors and 20 280 matched non-donors were followed for a median of\n6.5 years (maximum 17.7 years). Median age was 43 at the time of\ndonation (interquartile range 34-50) and 50 at the time of follow-up\n(42-58).\nMain outcome measures The primary outcome was a composite of\ntime to death or first major cardiovascular event. The secondary outcome\nwas time to first major cardiovascular event censored for death.\nResults The risk of the primary outcome of death and major\ncardiovascular events was lower in donors than in non-donors (2.8 v 4.1\nevents per 1000 person years; hazard ratio 0.66, 95% confidence interval\n0.48 to 0.90). The risk of major cardiovascular events censored for death\nwas no different in donors than in non-donors (1.7 v 2.0 events per 1000\nperson years; 0.85, 0.57 to 1.27). Results were similar in all sensitivity\nanalyses. Older age and lower income were associated with a higher\nrisk of death and major cardiovascular events in both donors and\nnon-donors when each group was analysed separately.\nConclusions The risk of major cardiovascular events in donors is no\nhigher in the first decade after kidney donation compared with a similarly\nhealthy segment of the general population. While we will continue to\nfollow people in this study, these interim results add to the evidence\nbase supporting the safety of the practice among carefully selected\ndonors.\nIntroduction\nIn the general population there is a robust association between\nreduced kidney function and an increased risk of cardiovascular\ndisease.1\nIt is possible that this risk could apply to the over 27\n000 registered people who donate a kidney worldwide each\nCorrespondence to: A Garg, London Kidney Clinical Research Unit, Room ELL-101, Westminster, London Health Sciences Centre, 800 Commissioners\nRoad East, London, Ontario, Canada N6A 4G5 amit.garg@lhsc.on.ca\nExtra material supplied by the author (see http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e1203?tab=related#webextra)\nAppendix: Definition of death and cardiovascular events using valid diagnostic and procedural codes in Ontario healthcare databases\nNo commercial reuse: See rights and reprints http://www.bmj.com/permissions Subscribe: http://www.bmj.com/subscribe\nBMJ 2012;344:e1203 doi: 10.1136/bmj.e1203 (Published 1 March 2012) Page 1 of 10\nResearch\nRESEARCH\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n.Serials\nat New York University, Serials Bobst Library Technical Services on 3 November 2025 https://www.bmj.com/ Downloaded from 1 March 2012. 10.1136/bmj.e1203 on BMJ: first published as \n\nyear.2 Donors lose half their renal mass, and, similar to reduced\nkidney function for other reasons, donor nephrectomy can\nincrease blood pressure and metabolites such as uric acid.3 4\nThese physiological markers, however, might not be valid\nsurrogates in donors for the clinically relevant outcomes that\npatients and their providers are most interested in.\nCardiovascular disease is a key event of interest and is a leading\ncause of death. Five studies have considered the risk of all cause\nmortality after kidney donation (studies from the United States,\nSweden, Norway, and Japan.5-9) Reassuringly, all five showed\nno evidence of increased long term mortality among kidney\ndonors. One of these studies also found no higher risk of\ncardiovascular mortality.8\nIn a preliminary study we also found\nno evidence of a higher risk of major cardiovascular events in\n1278 people who donated a kidney.10 Limitations of the analysis\nwith respect to study size and characteristics of the matched\nnon-donors, however, meant that uncertainties persisted with\nthese findings.11-13\nWe conducted a study that dealt with many of the previous\nlimitations. We manually reviewed the medical charts of over\n2000 living kidney donors in the largest province in Canada,\nlinked this information to universal healthcare databases to\nreliably identify major cardiovascular events long term with\nlittle loss to follow-up, and used methods of restriction and\nmatching to select the healthiest segment of the general\npopulation with which donor outcomes could be compared. We\nalso performed subgroup analyses according to the year of\nnephrectomy (duration of follow-up) to identify any trends in\nrisk with a longer period of follow-up. We did this study because\nbetter knowledge of major cardiovascular events in people who\nbecome living kidney donors maintains public trust in the\ntransplantation system, informs the choices of potential donors\nand recipients, and guides follow-up care to maintain good long\nterm health.\nMethods\nDesign and setting\nWe conducted a population based matched cohort study in\nOntario, Canada. Ontario currently has about 13 million\nresidents.14 Residents have universal access to hospital care and\nphysician services. The reporting of this study follows guidelines\nset out for observational studies.15\nData sources\nWe ascertained personal characteristics, covariate information,\nand outcome data from records in four databases. Trillium Gift\nof Life is Ontario’s central organ and tissue donation agency.\nThis database is unique in that it captured information on living\nkidney donors in the province at the time of donation. We\nmanually reviewed the medical charts of all people who\nunderwent donor nephrectomy at all five major transplant centres\nin Ontario between 1992 and 2009 to ensure the accuracy of\ndonor information in the Trillium database. The Canadian\nInstitute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Database\n(CIHI-DAD) records detailed diagnostic and procedural\ninformation for all admissions to hospital in Ontario. The\nOntario Health Insurance Plan database (OHIP) contains all\nhealth claims for inpatient and outpatient physician services.\nThe Ontario Registered Persons Database (RPDB) contains\ndemographic and vital status information on all Ontario\nresidents. These databases have been used extensively to\nresearch health outcomes and health services.16-20 The databases\nwere essentially complete for all variables used in this study.\nPopulation\nWe included all living kidney donors who were permanent\nresidents of Ontario. The date of the nephrectomy served as the\nstart date for donor follow-up and was designated the index\ndate. Choosing the best type of non-donors with which donors\ncan be compared is central to any study of relative risks\nassociated with donor nephrectomy.21 Donors go through a\ndetailed selection process and are inherently healthier than the\ngeneral population. We used techniques of restriction and\nmatching to select the healthiest segment of the general\npopulation. We randomly assigned an index date to the entire\nadult general population according to the distribution of index\ndates in donors. We then identified comorbidities and measures\nof access to healthcare from the beginning of available database\nrecords (1 July 1991) to the index date. This provided an average\nof 11 years of medical records for baseline assessment, with\n99% of people having at least two years of baseline data for\nreview. Among the general population we excluded any adult\nwith any medical condition before the index date that could\npreclude donation. This included evidence of diagnostic,\nprocedural, or visit codes for any of genitourinary disease,\ndiabetes, hypertension, cancer, cardiovascular disease,\npulmonary disease, liver disease, rheumatological conditions,\nchronic infections, a history of nephrology consultation, and\nevidence of frequent physician visits (more than four visits in\nthe previous two years). We also excluded any person who failed\nto see a physician at least once in the two years before the index\ndate (given that Ontario has a shortage of physicians we wanted\nto ensure that non-donors had evidence of access for routine\nhealthcare needs including preventative health measures; we\nconducted a sensitivity analysis in which we removed this\nexclusion and the study results were not materially different).\nFrom a total of 9 643 344 adult Ontarians during the period of\ninterest, our selection procedures resulted in the exclusion of\n85% of adults (n=8 216 038). From the adults remaining we\nthen matched 10 non-donors to each donor. We matched on age\n(within two years), sex, index date (within six months), rural\n(population less than 10 000) or urban residence, and income\n(categorised into fifths of average neighbourhood income on\nthe index date).\nOutcomes\nAll people were followed until 31 March 2010 or emigration\nfrom the province. The primary outcome was a composite of\ntime to death or first major cardiovascular event (myocardial\ninfarction, stroke, coronary angioplasty, coronary bypass\nsurgery, carotid endarterectomy, repair of abdominal aortic\naneurysm, or peripheral vascular bypass surgery). The secondary\noutcomes were time to first major cardiovascular event censored\nfor death and components of the primary outcome analysed\nseparately. These outcomes were defined by using codes proved\nto have good validity when compared with chart review (see\nappendix on bmj.com). We examined the characteristics\nassociated with death and first major cardiovascular event\nseparately in donors and non-donors. These characteristics were\nage (per five years), sex, rural or urban residence, income fifth,\nand year of index date (per year).\nStatistical analysis\nWe assessed differences in baseline characteristics between\ndonors and non-donors using standardised differences.22 23 This\nmetric describes differences between group means relative to\nthe pooled standard deviation; differences greater than 10%\nreflect the potential for meaningful imbalance.

We used Cox regression stratified on\nmatched sets to calculate the hazard ratios with 95% confidence\nintervals. The proportional hazards assumption was met\n(non-significant donor×follow-up time interaction term, P=0.27).\nWe repeated the primary analysis in four prespecified subgroups\ndefined by the median age at the index date (≤55 v >55), sex,\nfirst degree relative with kidney failure, and index date\n(1992-2001 (median follow-up 11.4 years, interquartile range\n9.5-13.8) v 2002-9 (4.0 years, 2.4-4.8)). We defined subgroups\nby the characteristic in donors, with non-donors following their\nmatched donor. We examined whether hazard ratios differed\namong subgroups using a series of pairwise standard z tests.24\nWe examined the characteristics associated with a first major\ncardiovascular event separately in donors and non-donors using\nCox regression. We conducted all analysis with SAS software\nversion 9.2.\nResults\nBaseline characteristics\nTable 1 shows the baseline characteristics for 2028 living kidney\ndonors and 20 280 matched non-donors⇓. The median age was\n43 (interquartile range 34-50), and 60% were women. As\nexpected, donors had more physician visits in the year before\nthe index date than non-donors because such visits are a\nnecessary part of the evaluation process.\nMost living kidney donors were siblings of the recipients (35%),\nfollowed by spouses (19%), parents (14%), and children (13%).\nNearly half (43%) of the nephrectomies were performed\nlaparoscopically, and the rest were done with an open procedure.\nBefore donation, the median serum creatinine was 77 µmol/L\n(interquartile range 66-86 µmol/L) (equivalent to 0.87 mg/dL,\n0.75-0.97 mg/dL) and the estimated glomerular filtration rate\n(eGFR) was 97 mL/min/1.73 m2\n(86-109) (with the Chronic\nKidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula\n(CKD-EPI).25 The median length of follow-up was 6.5 years\n(6.8 years in donors, 6.4 years in non-donors, maximum 17.7\nyears). A total of 609 donors and 5744 non-donors were\nfollowed for a period of 10 years or more. The median age at\nthe time of last follow-up for the entire cohort was 50 (42-58).\nOf the 22 308 individuals (2028 donors, 20 280 non-donors),\n20 450 (91.7%) were alive at the end of study follow-up (31\nMarch 2010) and had not experienced a major cardiovascular\nevent, and 1206 (5.4%) were censored at a time of emigration\nfrom the province (48 (2.4%) donors, 1158 (5.7%) non-donors).\nThe total person years of follow-up was 162 508 (15 176 donors,\n147 332 non-donors).\nOutcomes\nFigure 1 and table 2 present the main outcomes⇓⇓. There were\n381 deaths (16 donors, 365 non-donors) and 313 major\ncardiovascular events (26 donors, 287 non-donors). The risk of\ndeath or first major cardiovascular event was lower in donors\nthan in non-donors (2.1% v 3.0%; 2.8 v 4.1 events per 1000\nperson years; hazard ratio 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.48\nto 0.90; log rank P=0.01). Table 2 shows the types of\ncardiovascular events⇓. There was no significant difference in\nthe risk of major cardiovascular events censored for death\nbetween donors and non-donors (1.3% v 1.4%, 1.7 v 2.0 events\nper 1000 person years; hazard ratio 0.85, 0.57 to 1.27). Figure\n2 shows the subgroup analyses⇓. An earlier index date (longer\nperiod of follow-up) did not influence the association between\nkidney donation and the primary outcome, nor did older age at\nindex date, sex, or history of a first degree biological relative\nwith kidney failure (P value for interaction ranged from 0.10 to\n0.48). Subgroup results were similar for the outcome of time to\nfirst major cardiovascular event censored for death. Older age\nand lower income were associated with a higher risk of death\nor first major cardiovascular event in both donors and\nnon-donors when each group was examined separately (table\n3)⇓.\nDiscussion\nThe risk of major cardiovascular events in people who donate\na kidney is no higher in the first decade after transplantation\nthan in matched non-donors. There is no trend of increased\ncardiovascular risk in subgroups of donors with a longer\n(compared with shorter) period of follow-up, nor do Kaplan\nMeier curves after 10 years of follow-up suggest any higher\nrisk of death or major cardiovascular events in donors compared\nwith non-donors.\nWe conducted this study to determine whether people who\ndonate a kidney have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease\nthan a similarly healthy segment of the general population.\nWhile we will continue to follow up people in this study, these\ninterim results provide important safety reassurances to donors,\ntheir recipients, and transplant professionals. Reassuringly, with\nlonger follow-up the observed risk for the primary outcome\ncontinued to be lower in donors than in non-donors. As stated\nby others, we attribute this lower risk to the rigorous selection\nprocess of establishing excellent health before donation, which\nincludes psychological assessment and counselling, abdominal\nimaging, cancer screening, and an assessment for chronic\ninfectious diseases.7 Healthy lifestyle behaviours are also\nemphasised at this time. Restriction of non-donors to the\nhealthiest segment of the general population, as done in this\nstudy, still did not replicate this process.\nStrengths and limitations of study\nOur analyses meaningfully assessed major cardiovascular events\nin previous kidney donors.10 We were able to do this because\nof the universal healthcare benefits in the province of Ontario,\nwith the collection of all healthcare encounters for all citizens.\nThis reduces concerns about selection and information biases.\nAs mentioned, for the present study we manually reviewed over\n2000 consecutive medical charts to ensure the accuracy of donor\ninformation presented in this study. The large number of donors\nand non-donors provided good precision for the estimates we\nprovide. Outcomes of death and major cardiovascular events\nwere ascertained in a reliable and valid manner in our data\nsources. Loss to follow-up, a concern in many long term\nfollow-up studies of donors, was minimal in our setting (less\nthan 6% of people emigrated from the province during\nfollow-up). Our data, however, are not without limitations.\nCause of death could not be reliably assessed in our data sources.\nOur results describing major cardiovascular events, however,\nare consistent with a study from Norway that showed no higher\nrisk of cardiovascular mortality in people who donated a kidney\ncompared with the general population (median follow-up 14.3\nyears from nephrectomy).8 Accurate racial information was not\navailable. Given that 75% of Ontario residents are white, these\nresults might generalise less well to non-white donors.26 The\nacceptance criteria of living donors in our region during the\nperiod of review were quite stringent.27 Thus, these data should\nnot be generalised to the recent practice of accepting donors\nwith health conditions such as obesity or hypertension.28\nInformation on kidney function and family history of kidney\nNo commercial reuse: See rights and reprints http://www.bmj.com/permissions Subscribe: http://www.bmj.com/subscribe\nBMJ 2012;344:e1203 doi: 10.1136/bmj.e1203 (Published 1 March 2012) Page 3 of 10\nRESEARCH\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n.Serials\nat New York University, Serials Bobst Library Technical Services on 3 November 2025 https://www.bmj.com/ Downloaded from 1 March 2012. 10.1136/bmj.e1203 on BMJ: first published as \n\ndisease were unavailable in non-donors, and measurements such\nas blood pressure and body mass index (BMI) before\ntransplantation were unavailable in both donors and non-donors.\nThis information might have allowed for better selection of\nnon-donors. Collection of such information in the number of\nindividuals needed to adequately examine cardiovascular events\nin our setting, however, would have been prohibitively\nexpensive, with results unavailable for another decade. Finally,\nwe did not have data on glomerular filtration rate in donors\nduring follow-up, which precluded an assessment of\ncardiovascular risk according to this feature.\nComparison with other studies\nA collaborative meta-analysis of multiple general population\nnon-donor cohorts has recently summarised the association\nbetween reduced kidney function and cardiovascular disease.1\nOver a median follow-up of eight years, the risk of\ncardiovascular mortality increases with a lower estimated\nglomerular filtration rate. Compared with an estimated\nglomerular filtration rate of 90-104 mL/min/1.73 m², hazard\nratios for cardiovascular mortality are 1.03 (95% confidence\ninterval 0.85 to 1.24) for an estimated rate of 75-89 mL/min/1.73\nm², 1.09 (0.92 to 1.29) for an estimated rate of 60-74\nmL/min/1.73 m², 1.52 (1.18 to 1.97) for an estimated rate of\n45-59 mL/min/1.73 m², and 2.04 (1.80 to 3.21) for an estimated\nrate of 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m². Similar associations with\nnarrower confidence intervals are seen for all cause mortality.\nConcurrent evidence of albuminuria increases these risks. In\nthe donor setting, about 10% of individuals show 300 mg or\nmore of proteinuria a day in the decade after donation. Donors\nare more likely to develop microalbuminuria than the general\npopulation. In addition, in the decade after donation 40% of\npeople who donate a kidney have a glomerular filtration rate of\n60-80 mL/min/1.73 m² and 10% have a of 30-59 mL/min/1.73\nm².29 30\nSo how does one reconcile the lack of observed risk of\ncardiovascular disease among living donors in the current study\nwith the observed risk among individuals with reduced\nglomerular filtration rate in general population cohorts? Firstly,\nthe association seen in the general population might not be\ncausal. It might, for example, reflect systemic atherosclerosis\nrelated to diabetes, hypertension, and older age, which coexist\nwith reduced glomerular filtration rate but which are not fully\naccounted for in multivariable models. On the other hand, donors\ndevelop reduced glomerular filtration rate and low grade\nproteinuria through a non-pathological process, which might\nnot carry the same prognostic relevance. Secondly, the process\nof donor evaluation is used to select individuals who are in\nexcellent health with good long term prognosis. In our setting,\nfollow-up healthcare is a universal benefit to all Canadians, and\nwe have previously confirmed that donors tend to have more\nhave routine primary healthcare visits in follow-up than\nnon-donors.10 These elements of healthcare, which can include\nearly detection and management of cardiovascular risk factors,\ncould offset any increase in risk of cardiovascular disease\nattributable to reduced glomerular filtration rate. If unmeasured\nbaseline cardiovascular risk factors were more prevalent in\nnon-donors than donors in our study, however, this could have\nmasked evidence of an increased risk of cardiovascular disease\nin donors. For these reasons it remains prudent to counsel all\ndonors on modifiable risk factors that prevent future\ncardiovascular disease both before and after the donation\nprocess. In our study the non-modifiable factor of older age and\nthe difficult to modify factor of low income were similarly\nassociated with death and cardiovascular events in donors and\nnon-donors. Finally, it is possible that an association between\nliving donation and risk of cardiovascular disease does exist\nbut takes much longer to manifest. It might depend on more\ndonors entering an older age range and manifesting a glomerular\nfiltration rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2\nin the decades after\ndonation. For this reason, ongoing follow-up of this and other\ndonor cohorts is warranted.\nConclusion\nTaken together with other studies that have shown no increase\nin mortality in the decades after kidney donation, the present\nstudy adds to the available evidence base supporting the safety\nof the practice among carefully selected donors.27 The results\ndo not provide evidence to justify relaxing the rigorous criteria\nused to select people who become kidney donors.\nWe thank Ping Li and Nelson Chong from the Institute for Clinical\nEvaluative Sciences, and Frank Markel, Versha Prakash, and Keith\nWong from Trillium Gift of Life Network for their support.

The study involved 2028 living kidney donors and 20,280 matched non-donors from Ontario, Canada, between 1992 and 2009. The researchers used techniques of restriction and matching to select the healthiest segment of the general population for comparison with donors. The study found that living kidney donors had a significantly lower risk of major cardiovascular events and death compared to the control group, even after adjusting for known cardiovascular risk factors. The authors suggest that these findings may help alleviate concerns regarding the long-term risks of major cardiovascular events and death in living kidney donors. The study also found that older age, female gender, rural residence, lower income, and more recent year of index date (duration of follow-up) were associated with a higher risk of death or major cardiovascular events in both donors and non-donors. The study recommends further investigation into the mechanisms underlying the observed associations."}
