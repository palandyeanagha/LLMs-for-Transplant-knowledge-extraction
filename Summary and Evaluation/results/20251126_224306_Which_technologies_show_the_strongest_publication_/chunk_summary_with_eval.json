    "summary": "This article presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of vitamin D supplementation on proteinuria, renal function, and hypercalcemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients without dialysis or transplantation needs. The review identifies 18 eligible RCTs involving a total of 1836 patients with CKD at stages 3 or 5, and GFR values ranging from 6.60 ml/min/1.73 m². The analysis indicates that vitamin D reduces proteinuria in non-dialysis patients (RR, 2.00; 95%CI, 1.42 to 2.81), with no significant differences between newer and established vitamin D sterols (P = 0.14). The analysis also suggests that vitamin D may improve renal function (RR, 1.42; 95%CI, 1.10 to 1.82) and reduce the incidence of hypercalcemia (RR, 0.48; 95%CI, 0.30 to 0.73) in CKD patients. However, the review highlights the need for larger, well-designed RCTs to confirm these findings due to the low quality of evidence in most of the analyzed trials. Additionally, the review notes the potential for publication and reporting biases in some of the studies.",

However, advances in algorithm devel￾opment, combined with the ease of access to computa￾tional resources, allows AI to be applied in radiological\ndecision-making at a higher functional level [7].\nThe wind of change\nThe great enthusiasm for and dynamism in the develop￾ment of AI systems in radiology is shown by the increase\nin publications on this topic (Figs. 4 and 5). Only 10\nyears ago, the total number of publications on AI in\nradiology only just exceeded 100 per year. Thereafter, we\nhad a tremendous increase, with over 700–800\npublications per year in 2016–17. In the last couple of\nyears, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic reson￾ance imaging (MRI) have collectively accounted for more\nthan 50% of articles, though radiography, mammography,\nand ultrasound are also represented (Table 1). Neuroradi￾ology (here evaluated as imaging of the central nervous\nsystem) is the most involved subspecialty (accounting for\nabout one-third of the papers), followed by musculoskel￾etal, cardiovascular, breast, urogenital, lung/thorax, and\nabdominal radiology, each representing between 6 and 9%\nof the total number of papers (Table 2). AI currently has\nan impact on the field of radiology, with MRI and neuro￾radiology as the major fields of innovation.\nRecent meetings have also proven the interest in AI\napplications. During the 2018 European Congress of\nRadiology and the 2017 Annual Meeting of the Radio￾logical Society of North America, AI represented the\nfocus of many talks. Studies showed the application of\nDL algorithms for assessing the risk of malignancy for a\nlung nodule, estimating skeletal maturity from paediatric\nhand radiographs, classifying liver masses, and even ob￾viating the need for thyroid and breast biopsies [9–11];\nat the same time, the vendors showed examples of AI\napplications in action [9, 10].\nAI in radiology: threat or opportunity?\nA motto of radiology residents is: “The more images you\nsee, the more examinations you report, the better you\nget”. The same principle works for ML, and in particular\nfor DL. In the past decades, medical imaging has evolved\nfrom projection images, such as radiographs or planar\nscintigrams, to tomographic (i.e. cross-sectional) images,\nsuch as ultrasound (US), CT, tomosynthesis, positron\nFig. 2 Comparison between classic machine learning and deep learning approaches applied to a classification task.

Radiologists again at\nthe forefront of innovation in medicine\nFilippo Pesapane1†\n, Marina Codari2*† and Francesco Sardanelli2,3\nAbstract\nOne of the most promising areas of health innovation is the application of artificial intelligence (AI), primarily in medical\nimaging. This article provides basic definitions of terms such as “machine/deep learning” and analyses the integration\nof AI into radiology. Publications on AI have drastically increased from about 100–150 per year in 2007–2008\nto 700–800 per year in 2016–2017. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography collectively account for\nmore than 50% of current articles. Neuroradiology appears in about one-third of the papers, followed by musculoskeletal,\ncardiovascular, breast, urogenital, lung/thorax, and abdomen, each representing 6–9% of articles. With an irreversible\nincrease in the amount of data and the possibility to use AI to identify findings either detectable or not by the human\neye, radiology is now moving from a subjective perceptual skill to a more objective science. Radiologists, who were on\nthe forefront of the digital era in medicine, can guide the introduction of AI into healthcare. Yet, they will not be replaced\nbecause radiology includes communication of diagnosis, consideration of patient’s values and preferences, medical\njudgment, quality assurance, education, policy-making, and interventional procedures. The higher efficiency provided\nby AI will allow radiologists to perform more value-added tasks, becoming more visible to patients and playing a vital\nrole in multidisciplinary clinical teams.\nKeywords: Neural networks (computer), Artificial intelligence, Deep learning, Machine learning, Radiology\nKey points\n\u0001 Over 10 years, publications on AI in radiology have\nincreased from 100–150 per year to 700–800 per\nyear\n\u0001 Magnetic resonance imaging and computed\ntomography are the most involved techniques\n\u0001 Neuroradiology appears as the most involved\nsubspecialty (accounting for about one-third of the\npapers), followed by musculoskeletal, cardiovascular,\nbreast, urogenital, lung/thorax, and abdominal\nradiology (each representing 6–9% of articles)\n\u0001 Radiologists, the physicians who were on the\nforefront of the digital era in medicine, can now\nguide the introduction of AI in healthcare\nIntroduction\nOne of the most promising areas of health innovation is\nthe application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical im￾aging, including, but not limited to, image processing and\ninterpretation [1]. Indeed, AI may find multiple applica￾tions, from image acquisition and processing to aided\nreporting, follow-up planning, data storage, data mining,\nand many others. Due to this wide range of applications, AI\nis expected to massively impact the radiologist’s daily life.\nThis article provides basic definitions of terms com￾monly used when discussing AI applications, analyses\nvarious aspects related to the integration of AI in the\nradiological workflow, and provides an overview of the\nbalance between AI threats and opportunities for radiol￾ogists. Awareness of this trend is a necessity, especially\nfor younger generations who will face this revolution.\nArtificial intelligence: definitions\nThe term AI is applied when a device mimics cognitive\nfunctions, such as learning and problem solving [2].\n* Correspondence: marina.codari@grupposandonato.it †\nFilippo Pesapane and Marina Codari contributed equally to this work.\n2\nUnit of Radiology, IRCCS Policlinico San Donato, Via Morandi 30, 20097 San\nDonato Milanese, Milan, Italy\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nEuropean Radiology\nExperimental\n© The Author(s). 2018 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and",

The submitter seeking this clearance must provide substantial proof of equivalence in their\napplication. Without an approval of being substantially equivalent to the other algorithm, the one pending approval cannot\nbe legally marketed.\nPremarket approval Premarket approval is issued to algorithms for Class III medical devices. The latter are those that can have a large impact on\nhuman health and as such, their evaluation undergo more thorough scientific and regulatory processes to determine their\nsafety and effectiveness. In order to approve an application, the FDA determines that the device’s safety and effectiveness is\nsupported by satisfactory scientific evidence. Upon approval, the applicant can proceed with marketing the product.\nde novo pathway Regarding the de novo classification, it is used to classify those novel medical devices for which there are no legally\nmarketed counterparts, but which offer adequate safety and effectiveness with general controls.

Similarly, adopting conservative priors \ncan substantially reduce the likelihood of claiming that \nan effect exists when in fact it does not85. At present, \nsignificance testing remains the dominant framework \nwithin neuroscience, but the flexibility of alternative (for \nexample, Bayesian) approaches means that they should \nbe taken seriously by the field.\nConclusions and future directions\nA consequence of the remarkable growth in neurosci￾ence over the past 50 years has been that the effects we \nnow seek in our experiments are often smaller and more \nsubtle than before as opposed to when mostly easily dis￾cernible ‘low-hanging fruit’ were targeted. At the same \ntime, computational analysis of very large datasets is now \nrelatively straightforward, so that an enormous number of \ntests can be run in a short time on the same dataset. These \ndramatic advances in the flexibility of research design and \nanalysis have occurred without accompanying changes to \nother aspects of research design, particularly power. For \nexample, the average sample size has not changed sub￾stantially over time88 despite the fact that neuroscientists \nare likely to be pursuing smaller effects. The increase in \nresearch flexibility and the complexity of study designs89\ncombined with the stability of sample size and search for \nincreasingly subtle effects has a disquieting consequence: \na dramatic increase in the likelihood that statistically sig￾nificant findings are spurious. This may be at the root of \nthe recent replication failures in the preclinical literature8\nand the correspondingly poor translation of these findings \ninto humans90.\nLow power is a problem in practice because of the \nnormative publishing standards for producing novel, \nsignificant, clean results and the ubiquity of null \nhypothesis significance testing as the means of evaluat￾ing the truth of research findings. As we have shown, \nthese factors result in biases that are exacerbated by low \npower. Ultimately, these biases reduce the reproducibil￾ity of neuroscience findings and negatively affect the \nvalidity of the accumulated findings. Unfortunately, \npublishing and reporting practices are unlikely to \nchange rapidly. Nonetheless, existing scientific practices \ncan be improved with small changes or additions that \napproximate key features of the idealized model4,91,92. \nWe provide a summary of recommendations for future \nresearch practice in BOX 2.\nIncreasing disclosure. False positives occur more fre￾quently and go unnoticed when degrees of freedom in \ndata analysis and reporting are undisclosed5\n. Researchers \ncan improve confidence in published reports by noting \nin the text: “We report how we determined our sample \nsize, all data exclusions, all data manipulations, and all \nmeasures in the study.”7\n When such a statement is not \npossible, disclosure of the rationale and justification of \ndeviations from what should be common practice (that \nis, reporting sample size, data exclusions, manipula￾tions and measures) will improve readers’ understand￾ing and interpretation of the reported effects and, \ntherefore, of what level of confidence in the reported \neffects is appropriate.

Therein how to control the\nspreading process is of particular interests [5], where the\nidentification of influential nodes is a crucial issue according to\nthe assumption that highly influential nodes are more likely to be\ninfected and to infect a larger number of nodes [6–8].\nA number of centrality indices have been proposed to address\nthis problem, such as degree centrality, closeness centrality [9],\nbetweenness centrality [10], and eigenvector centrality [11].\nDegree centrality is a straightforward and efficient metric but less\nrelevant. Recent researches show that top-degree ranking nodes\nhave positive effects on cooperative behaviors in social networks\n[12,13]. However, the location of a node in the network may play\na more important role than its degree. For example, a node\nlocated in the center of the network, having a few highly influential\nneighbors, may be more influential than a node having a larger\nnumber of less influential neighbors. Considering this fact, Kitsak\net al. [6] proposed a coarse-grained method by using k-core\ndecomposition to quantify a node’s influence based on the\nassumption that nodes in the same shell have similar influence\nand nodes in higher-level shells are likely to infect more nodes.\nThis method may fail in some cases. For example, in a tree, all\nnodes are in 1-core and thus expected to have the same influence\naccording to [6]. However, this tree may be hierarchically\norganized (e.g., the binary tree) and nodes near the root have\nmuch higher influence than leaves. Chen et al. [14] devised a semi￾local index by considering the next nearest neighborhood, which\ncan well identify influential nodes in a hierarchical tree and give\nmore elaborate division than k-core decomposition. Experimental\nresults demonstrated that the semi-local index performs as good as\nglobal indices while has much lower computational complexity,\nand thus it obtains a good trade-off on effectiveness and efficiency.\nRecently, Chen et al. [15] considered the effect of path number\nand path diversity while ranking the spreading ability of nodes in\nnetworks and introduced two correction factors correspondingly.\nThe ranking accuracy is considerably increased compared with\nsome well-known ranking methods, such as PageRank and\nLeaderRank.\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e77455",

The results were presented from the random-effect\nmodel. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata software\n(Stata version 11, College Station, Texas).\nResults\nWe identified 769 full-text articles via database searches and 4\nabstracts via manual internet searches through September 30th,\n2012. Of these studies, 233 were from PubMed, 528 from\nEmbase.com, and 8 from Ovid platform. After auto screening was\nperformed using the Endnote program, 260 duplicate articles were\nremoved, and 509 full-text articles were identified by manual\nscreening. Of the 4 abstracts selected, 2 were excluded for lack of\nrelevant data, and the remaining 2 were specific for trials that were\nreported in full-text articles. To obtain as much accurate\ninformation as possible, we contacted five corresponding authors\nregarding the incomplete or vague data available in their\npublished works. Four of these authors kindly replied, but only\none provided additional information that we needed. Three full￾text articles were identified from the databases we listed above but\ndownloaded from Google Scholar. Ultimately, 18 published\nstudies [6,11–27] fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Figure 1 shows\nthe study flow regarding trial selection and reasons for exclusion.\nTrial characteristics\nA total 1836 patients between the ages of 18,93 years, with\nCKD at stage 3,5, GFR values ranging from 6,60 ml/min/\n1.73 m2 and no apparent need for dialysis or kidney transplan￾tation at baseline, were included. The treatment duration ranged\nfrom 1 to 24 months (median: 6 months). Six of these trials\nexplored the effect of vitamin D on proteinuria, twelve evaluated\nchanges in renal function, and fifteen discussed the incidence of\nhypercalcemia in treated subjects as compared to controls. Two\nother studies compared the effects of newer versus more\nestablished vitamin D compounds in non-dialysis patients\n(Table 2).\nStudy quality\nMost trials in our analysis were of moderate quality. Random\nsequence generation was clearly stated in 10 of 18 trials (56%).\nAllocation concealment was adequate in 5 of 18 trials (28%).\nBlinding of participants and personnel occurred in 12 of 18 trials\n(67%). Blinding of the outcome assessment was reported in 12 of\n18 trials (67%). By contrast, outcome data were provided\nincompletely in 4 of 18 trials (22%), and selective reporting was\nfound in 3 of 18 trials (17%). The likelihood of additional sources\nof bias was as high as 33% for 6 trials, and these related to\ndeclarations of interests or conflicts relating to the commercial\nsource of the funding.\nOutcome measurement\nProteinuria: Six RCTs (685 patients) compared the effects of\nvitamin D versus the use of placebo or no medication. Four of\nthese studies evaluated a newer vitamin D analogue, and the other\ntwo evaluated an established vitamin D compound. The pooled\ndata indicated that vitamin D reduced proteinuria in non-dialysis\npatients (RR, 2.00; 95%CI, 1.42 to 2.81). The RR associated with\nthe newer vitamin D sterol was 1.67 (95%CI, 1.22 to 2.29) and\nthat for the established compound was 2.76 (95%CI, 1.60 to 4.74)\n(Figure 2). The subgroup analysis showed no difference between\nthe newer vitamin D sterol and the established one (P = 0.14). We\nTable 2.

However, advances in algorithm devel￾opment, combined with the ease of access to computa￾tional resources, allows AI to be applied in radiological\ndecision-making at a higher functional level [7].\nThe wind of change\nThe great enthusiasm for and dynamism in the develop￾ment of AI systems in radiology is shown by the increase\nin publications on this topic (Figs. 4 and 5). Only 10\nyears ago, the total number of publications on AI in\nradiology only just exceeded 100 per year. Thereafter, we\nhad a tremendous increase, with over 700–800\npublications per year in 2016–17. In the last couple of\nyears, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic reson￾ance imaging (MRI) have collectively accounted for more\nthan 50% of articles, though radiography, mammography,\nand ultrasound are also represented (Table 1). Neuroradi￾ology (here evaluated as imaging of the central nervous\nsystem) is the most involved subspecialty (accounting for\nabout one-third of the papers), followed by musculoskel￾etal, cardiovascular, breast, urogenital, lung/thorax, and\nabdominal radiology, each representing between 6 and 9%\nof the total number of papers (Table 2). AI currently has\nan impact on the field of radiology, with MRI and neuro￾radiology as the major fields of innovation.\nRecent meetings have also proven the interest in AI\napplications. During the 2018 European Congress of\nRadiology and the 2017 Annual Meeting of the Radio￾logical Society of North America, AI represented the\nfocus of many talks. Studies showed the application of\nDL algorithms for assessing the risk of malignancy for a\nlung nodule, estimating skeletal maturity from paediatric\nhand radiographs, classifying liver masses, and even ob￾viating the need for thyroid and breast biopsies [9–11];\nat the same time, the vendors showed examples of AI\napplications in action [9, 10].\nAI in radiology: threat or opportunity?\nA motto of radiology residents is: “The more images you\nsee, the more examinations you report, the better you\nget”. The same principle works for ML, and in particular\nfor DL. In the past decades, medical imaging has evolved\nfrom projection images, such as radiographs or planar\nscintigrams, to tomographic (i.e. cross-sectional) images,\nsuch as ultrasound (US), CT, tomosynthesis, positron\nFig. 2 Comparison between classic machine learning and deep learning approaches applied to a classification task.

Radiologists again at\nthe forefront of innovation in medicine\nFilippo Pesapane1†\n, Marina Codari2*† and Francesco Sardanelli2,3\nAbstract\nOne of the most promising areas of health innovation is the application of artificial intelligence (AI), primarily in medical\nimaging. This article provides basic definitions of terms such as “machine/deep learning” and analyses the integration\nof AI into radiology. Publications on AI have drastically increased from about 100–150 per year in 2007–2008\nto 700–800 per year in 2016–2017. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography collectively account for\nmore than 50% of current articles. Neuroradiology appears in about one-third of the papers, followed by musculoskeletal,\ncardiovascular, breast, urogenital, lung/thorax, and abdomen, each representing 6–9% of articles. With an irreversible\nincrease in the amount of data and the possibility to use AI to identify findings either detectable or not by the human\neye, radiology is now moving from a subjective perceptual skill to a more objective science. Radiologists, who were on\nthe forefront of the digital era in medicine, can guide the introduction of AI into healthcare. Yet, they will not be replaced\nbecause radiology includes communication of diagnosis, consideration of patient’s values and preferences, medical\njudgment, quality assurance, education, policy-making, and interventional procedures. The higher efficiency provided\nby AI will allow radiologists to perform more value-added tasks, becoming more visible to patients and playing a vital\nrole in multidisciplinary clinical teams.\nKeywords: Neural networks (computer), Artificial intelligence, Deep learning, Machine learning, Radiology\nKey points\n\u0001 Over 10 years, publications on AI in radiology have\nincreased from 100–150 per year to 700–800 per\nyear\n\u0001 Magnetic resonance imaging and computed\ntomography are the most involved techniques\n\u0001 Neuroradiology appears as the most involved\nsubspecialty (accounting for about one-third of the\npapers), followed by musculoskeletal, cardiovascular,\nbreast, urogenital, lung/thorax, and abdominal\nradiology (each representing 6–9% of articles)\n\u0001 Radiologists, the physicians who were on the\nforefront of the digital era in medicine, can now\nguide the introduction of AI in healthcare\nIntroduction\nOne of the most promising areas of health innovation is\nthe application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical im￾aging, including, but not limited to, image processing and\ninterpretation [1]. Indeed, AI may find multiple applica￾tions, from image acquisition and processing to aided\nreporting, follow-up planning, data storage, data mining,\nand many others. Due to this wide range of applications, AI\nis expected to massively impact the radiologist’s daily life.\nThis article provides basic definitions of terms com￾monly used when discussing AI applications, analyses\nvarious aspects related to the integration of AI in the\nradiological workflow, and provides an overview of the\nbalance between AI threats and opportunities for radiol￾ogists.

At present, \nsignificance testing remains the dominant framework \nwithin neuroscience, but the flexibility of alternative (for \nexample, Bayesian) approaches means that they should \nbe taken seriously by the field.\nConclusions and future directions\nA consequence of the remarkable growth in neurosci￾ence over the past 50 years has been that the effects we \nnow seek in our experiments are often smaller and more \nsubtle than before as opposed to when mostly easily dis￾cernible ‘low-hanging fruit’ were targeted. At the same \ntime, computational analysis of very large datasets is now \nrelatively straightforward, so that an enormous number of \ntests can be run in a short time on the same dataset. These \ndramatic advances in the flexibility of research design and \nanalysis have occurred without accompanying changes to \nother aspects of research design, particularly power. For \nexample, the average sample size has not changed sub￾stantially over time88 despite the fact that neuroscientists \nare likely to be pursuing smaller effects. The increase in \nresearch flexibility and the complexity of study designs89\ncombined with the stability of sample size and search for \nincreasingly subtle effects has a disquieting consequence: \na dramatic increase in the likelihood that statistically sig￾nificant findings are spurious. This may be at the root of \nthe recent replication failures in the preclinical literature8\nand the correspondingly poor translation of these findings \ninto humans90.\nLow power is a problem in practice because of the \nnormative publishing standards for producing novel, \nsignificant, clean results and the ubiquity of null \nhypothesis significance testing as the means of evaluat￾ing the truth of research findings. As we have shown, \nthese factors result in biases that are exacerbated by low \npower. Ultimately, these biases reduce the reproducibil￾ity of neuroscience findings and negatively affect the \nvalidity of the accumulated findings. Unfortunately, \npublishing and reporting practices are unlikely to \nchange rapidly. Nonetheless, existing scientific practices \ncan be improved with small changes or additions that \napproximate key features of the idealized model4,91,92. \nWe provide a summary of recommendations for future \nresearch practice in BOX 2.\nIncreasing disclosure. False positives occur more fre￾quently and go unnoticed when degrees of freedom in \ndata analysis and reporting are undisclosed5\n. Researchers \ncan improve confidence in published reports by noting \nin the text: “We report how we determined our sample \nsize, all data exclusions, all data manipulations, and all \nmeasures in the study.”7\n When such a statement is not \npossible, disclosure of the rationale and justification of \ndeviations from what should be common practice (that \nis, reporting sample size, data exclusions, manipula￾tions and measures) will improve readers’ understand￾ing and interpretation of the reported effects and, \ntherefore, of what level of confidence in the reported \neffects is appropriate.

        "* E-mail: linyuan.lue@unifr.ch\nIntroduction\nWith great theoretical and practical significance, the studies on\nepidemic and information spreading in biological, social and\ntechnological networks become one of the most exciting domains\nin many branches of sciences [1–4]. Therein how to control the\nspreading process is of particular interests [5], where the\nidentification of influential nodes is a crucial issue according to\nthe assumption that highly influential nodes are more likely to be\ninfected and to infect a larger number of nodes [6–8].\nA number of centrality indices have been proposed to address\nthis problem, such as degree centrality, closeness centrality [9],\nbetweenness centrality [10], and eigenvector centrality [11].\nDegree centrality is a straightforward and efficient metric but less\nrelevant. Recent researches show that top-degree ranking nodes\nhave positive effects on cooperative behaviors in social networks\n[12,13]. However, the location of a node in the network may play\na more important role than its degree. For example, a node\nlocated in the center of the network, having a few highly influential\nneighbors, may be more influential than a node having a larger\nnumber of less influential neighbors. Considering this fact, Kitsak\net al. [6] proposed a coarse-grained method by using k-core\ndecomposition to quantify a node’s influence based on the\nassumption that nodes in the same shell have similar influence\nand nodes in higher-level shells are likely to infect more nodes.\nThis method may fail in some cases. For example, in a tree, all\nnodes are in 1-core and thus expected to have the same influence\naccording to [6]. However, this tree may be hierarchically\norganized (e.g., the binary tree) and nodes near the root have\nmuch higher influence than leaves. Chen et al. [14] devised a semi￾local index by considering the next nearest neighborhood, which\ncan well identify influential nodes in a hierarchical tree and give\nmore elaborate division than k-core decomposition. Experimental\nresults demonstrated that the semi-local index performs as good as\nglobal indices while has much lower computational complexity,\nand thus it obtains a good trade-off on effectiveness and efficiency.\nRecently, Chen et al. [15] considered the effect of path number\nand path diversity while ranking the spreading ability of nodes in\nnetworks and introduced two correction factors correspondingly.\nThe ranking accuracy is considerably increased compared with\nsome well-known ranking methods, such as PageRank and\nLeaderRank.\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e77455",
        "Publication bias was assessed with funnel plots and Egger’s test.\nBoth random-effect and fixed-effect models were used to pool the\ndata, and the two models yielded mainly identical results in our\nanalysis. The results were presented from the random-effect\nmodel. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata software\n(Stata version 11, College Station, Texas).\nResults\nWe identified 769 full-text articles via database searches and 4\nabstracts via manual internet searches through September 30th,\n2012. Of these studies, 233 were from PubMed, 528 from\nEmbase.com, and 8 from Ovid platform. After auto screening was\nperformed using the Endnote program, 260 duplicate articles were\nremoved, and 509 full-text articles were identified by manual\nscreening. Of the 4 abstracts selected, 2 were excluded for lack of\nrelevant data, and the remaining 2 were specific for trials that were\nreported in full-text articles. To obtain as much accurate\ninformation as possible, we contacted five corresponding authors\nregarding the incomplete or vague data available in their\npublished works. Four of these authors kindly replied, but only\none provided additional information that we needed. Three full￾text articles were identified from the databases we listed above but\ndownloaded from Google Scholar. Ultimately, 18 published\nstudies [6,11–27] fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Figure 1 shows\nthe study flow regarding trial selection and reasons for exclusion.\nTrial characteristics\nA total 1836 patients between the ages of 18,93 years, with\nCKD at stage 3,5, GFR values ranging from 6,60 ml/min/\n1.73 m2 and no apparent need for dialysis or kidney transplan￾tation at baseline, were included. The treatment duration ranged\nfrom 1 to 24 months (median: 6 months). Six of these trials\nexplored the effect of vitamin D on proteinuria, twelve evaluated\nchanges in renal function, and fifteen discussed the incidence of\nhypercalcemia in treated subjects as compared to controls. Two\nother studies compared the effects of newer versus more\nestablished vitamin D compounds in non-dialysis patients\n(Table 2).\nStudy quality\nMost trials in our analysis were of moderate quality. Random\nsequence generation was clearly stated in 10 of 18 trials (56%).\nAllocation concealment was adequate in 5 of 18 trials (28%).\nBlinding of participants and personnel occurred in 12 of 18 trials\n(67%). Blinding of the outcome assessment was reported in 12 of\n18 trials (67%). By contrast, outcome data were provided\nincompletely in 4 of 18 trials (22%), and selective reporting was\nfound in 3 of 18 trials (17%). The likelihood of additional sources\nof bias was as high as 33% for 6 trials, and these related to\ndeclarations of interests or conflicts relating to the commercial\nsource of the funding.\nOutcome measurement\nProteinuria: Six RCTs (685 patients) compared the effects of\nvitamin D versus the use of placebo or no medication. Four of\nthese studies evaluated a newer vitamin D analogue, and the other\ntwo evaluated an established vitamin D compound. The pooled\ndata indicated that vitamin D reduced proteinuria in non-dialysis\npatients (RR, 2.00; 95%CI, 1.42 to 2.81). The RR associated with\nthe newer vitamin D sterol was 1.67 (95%CI, 1.22 to 2.29) and\nthat for the established compound was 2.76 (95%CI, 1.60 to 4.74)\n(Figure 2). The subgroup analysis showed no difference between\nthe newer vitamin D sterol and the established one (P = 0.14). We\nTable 2.
