How has the evidence changed regarding acceptable macro/microsteatosis in liver grafts?,"['[29,30]. Spitzer et al. [30] concluded that steatosis should\nbe added to the DRI, when dealing with a high-risk\ndonor. However, objective evaluation of the range of\nsteatosis, either as macro- or microvesicular steatosis, is\nnot standardized so far subjective to some degree [29].\nWe believe that routine donor biopsy evaluation may en\ufffeable the design of more powerful and robust donor risk\nscores.\nWe believe that the prognostic power of the DRI and\nET-DRI is further significantly undermined by the fact\nthat graft acceptance decisions on offered organs for\ntransplantation are not documented and evaluated in\nthese scores. There is an urgent need to evaluate and ad\ufffedress this shortcoming immediately, especially on the\nbackground of the current liver transplant scandals in\nGermany [23,31]. We believe that this aspect is a rele\ufffevant issue in liver transplantation today. Transplant cen\ufffeters regard their graft acceptance policy as their\npotential advantage in a highly competitive area for a\nvery scarce resource in times of ubiquitous organ short\ufffeage. It can be assumed that these aspects of potentially\nunwanted transparency by the proponents of transplant\ufffeation stood in the way of previous attempts to generate\nrobust prognostic scores that include donor organ qual\ufffeity. This may represent a deeper reason for the notorious\ndifficulty to assess donor organ quality and its impact on\nprognosis after transplantation objectively.\nThe balance of equity and utility in donor organ allo\ufffecation is a serious ethical dilemma. Several risk predic\ufffetion models are available and their head to head\ncomparisons would benefit from standardized reporting\nand formal, consistent statistical evaluation [18,26]. It\nwas claimed previously and in a different context that\noutcome selection and optimism biases may affect litera\ufffeture on prognostic scores in medicine [26].\nWe would like to propose joint efforts to develop a ro\ufffebust and objective donor risk score in an international\ncollaboration that should include the available large\ndata-sets from multiple institutions. We believe that the\ntime has come for a consensus on the reporting of the\nreasons for declined organ offers and on quality stan\ufffedards for prognostic scores and their statistical analysis\nand validation. Jacob et al. [18] proposed a reasonable\nscientific approach to the latter. High quality scientific\njournals should make uniform requirements mandatory\nfor the reporting of prognostic scores.\nConclusion\nThe results of this current study clearly show that the\nET-DRI is not applicable in the population from our\ncenter within the Eurotransplant community for the pre\ufffediction of patient or graft survival. On the background\nof a paucity of proper prognostic models, justified organ\nallocation which weighs urgency against prediction of\nsuccess of liver transplantation must be the aim of future\nresearch in this field.\nPatients and methods\nEthics statement\nAs an observational retrospective study, according to the\nProfessional Code of the German Medical Association\n(article B.III. § 15.1), neither informed consent nor ap\ufffeproval of the ethics committee was needed for this\nstudy.\nPatients\n291 consecutive liver transplants were included to\nanalyze the model’s accuracy and applicability for this\ndataset of a major transplant centre in the Eurotrans\ufffeplant community. Included were 20 (6.9%) split liver\ntransplants, 30 (10.3%) acute re-transplants (retransplan\ufffetation within 30 days after the previous transplant) and\n25 (8.6%) chronic retransplants (primary transplantation\nn = 235, secondary transplantation n = 48, tertiary trans\ufffeplantation n = 6, quaternary transplantation n = 1) in a\ntotal of 257 patients (median age: 49.6 years, range: 18–\n69 years; males n = 177 (64.4%), females n = 114 (35.6%),\nratio males/females: 1.8). All transplants were performed\nin our centre between the 01/01/2007 and the 12/31/\n2010. The post-transplant observational period ended on', 'Biopsy findings in cases of rejection of liver allograft\nity of portal inflammatory changes. Other changes\nwere similarly graded in a semiquantitative manner.\nResults\nPEROPERATIVE BIOPSIES\nAbnormalities were invariably present in the per\ufffeoperative biopsy specimens, although these were usu\ufffeally unimportant. All seven showed centrilobular\nhepatocyte vacuolation and necrosis. In four cases\nthere was bridging necrosis and frank subcapsular\ninfarction. All the histological changes seen in these\nbiopsies improved on subsequent biopsy, although\ntwo cases showed persistent centrilobular necrosis or\nfibrosis, or both (cases 1 and 2). The severity of\nchanges seen in peroperative biopsy specimens was\nnot related to the cold ischaemic time.\nPOSTOPERATIVE BIOPSIES\nHistological changes of rejection were seen between\nsix days and five months after transplantation\n(Table 2).\nPORTAL INFLAMMATION AND BILE DUCT\nDAMAGE\nAcute rejection was characterised by a dense mixed\nportal inflammatory infiltrate composed mainly of\nlymphocytes and neutrophils with smaller numbers of\n1367\nplasma cells, macrophages, and eosinophils. A partic\ufffeularly striking finding was the presence of poly\ufffemorphs surrounding and infiltrating the epithelium of\nsmall bile ducts and ductules (Fig. 1). This was associ\ufffeated with a variable degree of nuclear hyper\ufffechromatism and cytoplasmic vacuolation of the bili\ufffeary epithelium. These acute changes were seen in nine\nbiopsy specimens taken six to 18 days after trans\ufffeplantation.\nIn one patient (case 2) the acute bile duct lesion was\nfollowed by complete loss of ducts on the 28th day\nafter transplantation (Fig. 2) and led to graft failure\nnecessitating retransplantation. In another patient\n(case 1) acute inflammation subsided, but bile duct\nepithelium showed severe focal atypia resembling that\nseen in graft v host disease (Fig. 3).8 In the remaining\nfive cases treatment with immunosuppression resulted\nin clinical improvement and resolution of histological\nchanges, although a residual, mild and predominantly\nmononuclear infiltrate persisted in all these cases.\nThe hepatectomy specimen removed for chronic\nrejection (case 2) showed complete absence of small\nbile ducts. Larger ducts showed features similar to\nthose noted in smaller ducts in previous biopsies with\nthe additional finding of numerous foamy histiocytes\nin surrounding connective tissue (Fig. 4). A small\namount of material resistant to diastase and positive\nfor periodic acid Schiff was present in their cyto\ufffeplasm, but fat stains yielded a negative result.\nTable 1 Clinical details ofpatients and timing of biopsies after transplantation\nCase Age and Original diagnosis No of Timing of biopsy Follow up\nNo sex biopsies (day after graft)\nI O.L. 10 40 F Primary biliary cirrhosis 2 90, 102 Died at 5 months\n2 O.L. 15 41 F Primary biliary cirrhosis 3 15, 28, 56 Regraft at 2 months and\nalive at 9 months\n3 O.L. 18 46 F Primary biliary cirrhosis 3 7, 28, 38 Alive at 5 months\n4 O.L. 19 40 F Primary biliary cirrhosis 3 6, 20, 28 Alive at 5 months\n5 O.L. 21 35 F Cryptogenic cirrhosis 4 15, 18, 30, 42 Alive at 4 months\n6 O.L. 22 15 F Cryptogenic cirrhosis 2 7, 48 Alive at 2 months\n7 O.L. 24 15 M al antitrypsin deficiency 4 6, 12, 16, 40 Alive at 2 months\nTable 2 Histologicalfindings in 21 biopsies taken after transplantation\nFeatures assessed Degree of abnormality\nMild or moderate Severe\nPortal changes:\nInflammation 12 9\nPolymorphonuclear infiltration of biliary epithelium 5 9\nVascular changes:\nArterial intimal hyperplasia 3 0\nPortal vein endothelial inflammation 8 3\nCentral vein endothelial inflammation 3 2\nLobular changes:\nCholestasis 7 11\nCentrilobular necrosis or fibrosis 5 0\nAcidophil bodies (solitary) 10 0\n(clusters) 3 0\nPolymorph aggregates 4 0\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n. University, Serials Bobst Library Technical Services Serials', '(typically from a registry) would be required to determine specific \nmarkers of viability.\nThe importance of bile production during NMP is unclear. \nPreliminary evidence from our group20 suggests that preservation \ninjury causes impaired hepatocellular uptake of bile salts. We have \nshown evidence of progressive accumulation of bile salts in the perfu\ufffesate of livers with high post-transplant transaminase levels; something \nthat also correlates with poor bile production during NMP. The extent \nand nature of the injury required to produce this effect is not clear but \ndoes appear to reflect organ quality rather than viability.\nHigh-risk organs (for example, those with steatosis) may benefit from \ntherapeutic interventions delivered during NMP: several groups are \nexploring potential strategies, including stem cell treatments, de-fatting \nagents and immunological modification of the organ. Future trials \nmay be needed to formally test the size of the effect of NMP on organ \nutilization; for this it will be necessary to randomize livers at the time \nof organ offering rather than the time of retrieval. Organ utilization, or \norgan utilization with 12-month graft survival (functional utilization) \nwould be a logical primary endpoint for a study of this sort.\nThis study describes the formal clinical evaluation of a novel tech\ufffenology in liver transplantation, and could herald the start of a new era \nof intervention during organ preservation. It represents a first, neces\ufffesary step in demonstrating that NMP is feasible, safe and effective in \nclinical practice; the fact that the study has definitively met its primary \nendpoint should now enable the exploration of the technology’s wider \npotential.\nOnline content\nAny Methods, including any statements of data availability and Nature Research \nreporting summaries, along with any additional references and Source Data files, \nare available in the online version of the paper at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-\n018-0047-9.\nReceived: 28 September 2017; Accepted: 8 March 2018; \nPublished online 18 April 2018.\n1.

Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and', 'of host liver mass in mice after infusion of 3 − 5% of the total\nrecipient liver cells (22). Finally, allogeneic rejection is most\nprobably the main cause for the observed decline of cell graft\nfunction within 1 year of HT (19). Although the safety of\nclinical HT has been very well established, therapeutic benefit\nhas been modest and only temporary so far. This is partially in\ncontrast with very convincing preclinical results obtained in a\nnumber of animal models of liver disease (2–4), possibly\nbecause these models do not properly mimic the disease in\nhumans. Animals usually develop liver injury within a few days\nor weeks, whereas in humans the injury is significantly more\nsevere occurring over many decades, thus highlighting a need\nof more realistic models of liver disease.\nPROCEDURES: HEPATOCYTE SOURCE, ISOLATION, QUALITY\nCONTROL, AND ADMINISTRATION FOR CELL\nTRANSPLANTATION\nHuman hepatocytes are isolated from (i) whole donor livers\nunsuitable/rejected for OLT, mostly because of severe\nsteatosis, prolonged ischemia time, older, or non-heart\ufffebeating donors, or (ii) from liver segments, mainly I and\nIV, which are available for cell isolation after split liver\ntransplantation. Alternatively, fetal and neonatal livers are\nbeing explored as a potential cell source (23,24) as they are\ncurrently not considered for OLT and may allow the isolation\nof very high-quality cells (9). Neonatal-derived hepatocytes,\nalthough not fully mature, show activity of some of the main\nenzymes responsible for hepatic-detoxifying functions (23).\nExplanted livers from patients with liver-based metabolic\ndisorders have also been considered as a potential source of\ncells. This concept was adopted from a similar approach used\nin the so-called “domino” liver transplantation performed\nsince the mid-1990s, in which a liver transplant recipient with\na known metabolic defect can donate his explanted native\nliver for use as liver graft in another patient (25). In a similar\nway, liver explants from patients with defined metabolic\ndisorders could become a source of hepatocytes, since their\nmissing enzymatic function would be performed by the\nrecipient’s native liver, left in place. This approach was used in\na 6-year-old boy with severe phenylketonuria transplanted\nwith hepatocytes isolated from a glycogen storage type 1b\nliver explant, with significant reduction of blood phenylala\ufffenine levels up to 3 months after transplantation (13).\nIn order to isolate the hepatocytes, a standardized three-step\ncollagenase perfusion technique originally developed by Berry\nand Friend and later modified (26–28) is used. First, major\nhepatic vessels are cannulated and perfused with Hank’s buffered\nsalt solution (HBSS) containing EGTA, which is able to chelate\ncalcium ions, thus disrupting the desmosomes, calcium\ufffedependent cell-to-cell adhesions. Second, the liver is flushed\nwith plain HBSS to remove any residue of EGTA. Third, the\ntissue is perfused with a calcium-dependent collagenase solution\nto digest the extracellular matrix. After breaking of the liver\ncapsule, the released liver cells are filtered and centrifuged at low\nspeed to separate hepatocytes from nonparenchymal cells.\nHepatocytes can be used fresh for transplantation or cryopre\ufffeserved. Several protocols have been described to cryopreserve\nhuman hepatocytes, with the best results being achieved\ncryopreserving 106\n–107 cells/ml in the University of Wisconsin\norgan preservation solution containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide\nand 5% glucose, and using a controlled-rate freezer (29).\nCryopreserved hepatocytes are then stored at –140 °C until\nrequired for HT. Hepatocyte isolations for use in clinical HT\nmust be performed under good manufacturing practice (GMP)\nin an aseptic and accredited units.\nEvaluation of hepatocyte quality before transplantation is\nvital, especially on cryopreserved cells, as it has been shown\nthat freeze-thawing cycles damage mitochondria, affect cell', 'withdrawal regimens are inconclusive, and most of them lack\nevidence of invasive liver biopsy. However, direct comparisons\nof these trials are difficult because of the lack of standardization.\nAccording to the current research results, the acute rejection rate\nafter IS withdrawal varies from 12 to 76% (Tables 1, 2), but it is\ngenerally moderate and almost reversible. Chronic rejection is\nrare (0–6%), and the incidence of graft loss owing to rejection\nis extremely low (39, 40). Over time, however, the prevalence\nand severity of chronic graft injury such as subclinical rejection,\nchronic portal inflammation, borderline hepatitis, and/or fibrosis\n(periportal and/or perivenous) would increase (41–51). Ten years\nafter transplantation, most studies report that normal histology\nis present in up to 30% of allografts; bridging fibrosis and/or\ncirrhosis may be equally common, accounting for about 60%\n(42, 45, 52). The transcriptome analysis of liver tissue revealed\nan expression profile very similar to that of T-cell mediated\nrejection (53). Notably, more than 90 percent of patients who\nstopped IS 20 years after the transplant did not experience\nrejection (27).

In summary, the above large con\ufffetrolled trials demonstrated that MSCs play a supportive \nrole in the treatment of liver failure and show satisfactory \ntolerability and beneficial effects on liver synthetic func\ufffetions and hepatic fibrosis resolution.\nMSC therapy for\xa0complications of\xa0liver transplantation\nOrthotopic liver transplantation is the only curative \nmeasure for patients with end-stage liver failure. How\ufffeever, the risk of complications after liver transplantation \nis still high, even with increases in surgical expertise. \nTwo of the most common complications following liver \ntransplant are rejection and infection. MSCs offer new \ntherapeutic opportunities to prevent and treat solid \norgan transplant rejection. A recent pilot study demon\ufffestrated that UC-MSC therapy can alleviate liver dam\ufffeage and improve allograft histology in liver transplant \npatients with acute graft rejection who did not respond \nto immunosuppressive agent dose adjustments. However, \nthe study was not carried out long enough to determine \nwhether decreased infection resulted from MSC infusion \n[19].\nHowever, in the same year, Detry et\xa0al. [20] enrolled \n10 liver transplant patients to receive MSCs infu\ufffesion and another 10 patients acted as controls. It was \nshown that no difference in the overall rates of rejec\ufffetion or graft survival was observed between the MSC \ninfusion group and the control group. And Month-6 \nbiopsies did not demonstrate a difference between \ngroups. The study indicated that the immunosuppres\ufffesion weaning in MSC recipients was not successful. \nThe results are completely different and contradictory \ncompared to those of the above pilot study. We ana\ufffelyze that the possible reason might be that the aim and \nexperimental design of the two studies were different. \nThe pilot study aimed to examine the clinical feasibil\ufffeity of MSC infusion as a therapeutic option for liver \nallograft rejection, and all patients were treated with', 'donor shortage [6]. This shortage in PHHs might be\nresolved with the emergence of human induced pluripo\ufffetent stem cells (hiPSCs), which could provide an\nunlimited source of hepatic-like cells (HLCs) [7, 8].\nhiPSC-HLCs have been used for engraftment in a liver\ninjury model and to repair injured liver tissue [9];\nhowever, following engraftment, it took weeks for\nhiPSC-HLCs to start producing detectable levels of spe\ufffecific proteins and exhibit hepatic function [10]. Because\nof the rapid deterioration of liver function and extensive\ntoxic substance accumulation [1], the treatment window\nfor ALF patients is very narrow, and the extended time\nperiod needed for engraftment with hiPSC-HLCs might\nnot be suitable for ALF therapy. Therefore, transplants\nthat can assume hepatic functions with little delay are\nrequired for ALF treatment.\nTransplantation of in vitro-generated organoids can\nregenerate functional tissue in vivo and might be a po\ufffetential approach for ALF treatment [11]. Previous stud\ufffeies have developed a macro-liver organoid (macro-LO)\nfrom hiPSCs with endothelial cells (ECs) and mesenchy\ufffemal cells (MCs) that can grow into vascularized,\nfunctional tissue post transplantation by recapitulating\nevents that occur in early liver organogenesis [12, 13].\nHowever, the three types of cells necessary for LO gener\ufffeation were derived from three different donors with dif\ufffeferent HLA types, and thus would not match any\nparticular patient’s HLA for clinical application. Clinical\nliver transplantation studies have found that incompat\ufffeible HLA matching between the graft and the patient is\nassociated with increased mortality and graft loss in ALF\npatient therapy [2]; therefore, LOs derived from a single\ndonor cell should be developed to match specific\npatients’ HLAs. Single donor-derived cells have the same\nhost genetic background and thus may recapitulate liver\norganogenesis more accurately to support LO differenti\ufffeation. Additionally, the LOs reported previously were\nstill at an immature stage, and they required 2 weeks to\ndifferentiate and exhibit hepatic function with human\ufffespecific albumin (ALB) production in vivo [12]. How\ufffeever, for ALF therapy, transplants that can immediately\nexhibit hepatic function in vivo are urgently needed [14],\nand functional LOs are thus considered to hold promise.\nTherefore, functional LOs generated from single donor\ncells are expected to be useful for ALF therapy.\nTo generate functional single donor cell-derived\n(SDC)-LOs for clinical application, all three types of cells\n(hiPSC-endoderm, ECs, and MCs) should be obtained\nfrom the same donor with high purity and few genomic\nmutations. Human somatic cells accumulate nuclear and\nmitochondrial genomic mutations over the course of\ntheir lifespan [15]; thus, cells obtained from newborns\nwould be expected to have fewer mutations than adult\ncells. ECs and MCs that have been used for LO\ngeneration are derived from newborn umbilical cords\n(UCs) and adult bone marrow (BM), respectively [12, 13].\nThe isolation of MCs from newborn BM requires an inva\ufffesive procedure that would cause harm to the newborn, so\na replacement MC source from the same newborn is thus\nnecessary for SDC-LO generation. The newborn UC is an\nimmature tissue with a large number of MCs that can be\nisolated without invasive procedures [16], and UC-derived\nMCs have characteristics similar to those of BM\ufffederived MCs (BM-MCs) [16]. Therefore, ECs and MCs\nderived from the same UC might be useful for generating\nfunctional SDC-LOs with the same donor-derived hiPSCs.\nIn this study, we obtained ECs and MCs from a single\ndonor UC and investigated the role of single donor\ufffederived ECs and MCs in LO generation and differenti\ufffeation. We also generated hiPSCs from the same donor\nto provide a hiPSC-endoderm source for LO generation.\nUsing these three types of cells, we generated functional\nSDC-LOs for ALF therapy.\nMethods\nEC and MC isolation and culture\nUnder the permission of the Ethical Review Board of']","This study investigates the potential of using normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) to preserve and resuscitate livers from expanded criteria donors (ECDs) for transplantation. The study compares the outcomes of NMP versus traditional cold storage (CS) in terms of graft function, bile production, and histopathologic changes. The results suggest that NMP improves graft function and reduces histopathologic changes compared to CS. The study also explores the use of macro-liver organoids (LOs) derived from single donor cells for ALF therapy. The study finds that LOs generated from single donor cells have fewer genomic mutations due to the use of cells from newborn sources.

How has the evidence changed regarding acceptable macro/microsteatosis in liver grafts?,"['R E S EAR CH Open Access\nPrognostic limitations of the Eurotransplant-donor\nrisk index in liver transplantation\nBenedikt Reichert1,2†\n, Alexander Kaltenborn1,3*†\n, Alon Goldis4 and Harald Schrem1\nAbstract\nBackground: Liver transplantation is the only life-saving therapeutic option for end-stage liver disease. Progressive\ndonor organ shortage and declining donor organ quality justify the evaluation of the leverage of the Donor-Risk-Index,\nwhich was recently adjusted to the Eurotransplant community’s requirements (ET-DRI). We analysed the prognostic\nvalue of the ET-DRI for the prediction of outcome after liver transplantation in our center within the Eurotransplant\ncommunity.\nResults: 291 consecutive adult liver transplants were analysed in a single centre study with ongoing data\ncollection. Determination of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was performed to\ncalculate the sensitivity, specificity, and overall correctness of the Eurotransplant-Donor-Risk-Index (ET-DRI) for the\nprediction of 3-month and 1-year mortality, as well as 3-month and 1-year graft survival. Cut-off values were\ndetermined with the best Youden-index. The ET-DRI is unable to predict 3-month mortality (AUROC: 0.477) and\n3-month graft survival (AUROC: 0.524) with acceptable sensitivity, specificity and overall correctness (54% and 56.3%,\nrespectively). Logistic regression confirmed this finding (p = 0.573 and p = 0.163, respectively). Determined cut-off\nvalues of the ET-DRI for these predictions had no significant influence on long-term patient and graft survival\n(p = 0.230 and p = 0.083, respectively; Kaplan-Meier analysis with Log-Rank test).\nConclusions: The ET-DRI should not be used for donor organ allocation policies without further evaluation, e.g. in\ncombination with relevant recipient variables. Robust and objective prognostic scores for donor organ allocation\npurposes are desperately needed to balance equity and utility in donor organ allocation.\nKeywords: Prognostic model, Accuracy, Goodness-of-fit, Score, Prediction, Validation\nBackground\nExpansion of the organ donor pool by using grafts with\nreduced quality has become reality in transplant centers\naround the world due to increasing donor organ short\ufffeage and raising numbers of patients on the waiting lists.\nThis has led to an increased awareness of the associated\nrisks for patient and graft survival [1-16]. Thus, a series\nof attempts to develop objective scores for the assess\ufffement of donor liver quality with significant influence on\npatient and/or graft survival have been made [1,2,4-9].\nIn the transplant literature there is a current debate on\nthe criteria for statistical validation of prognostic scores\nin liver transplantation that may be relevant for fair and\njust allocation rules that balance equity and utility\n[10,12,13,17,18]. Astonishingly, there is still a high het\ufffeerogeneity of statistical approaches to the validation of\nprognostic scores even though Jacob et al. published as\nearly as 2005 uniform quality criteria for the design, val\ufffeidation and reporting of prognostic scores in liver trans\ufffeplantation more than eight years ago [18]. Last year we\nhave reported from our centre that the Donor-Risk\ufffeIndex is not applicable to our patients for the prediction\nof three month mortality, three month patient survival,\nthree month graft survival as well as the necessity of\nacute retransplantation within thirty days [13]. In con\ufffetrast Blok et al. claimed in the same year that they were\nable to validate the value of the DRI for the prediction\nof three month, one year and three years graft survival\nin the Eurotransplant region [3].

This raises the fundamental question: What\nare the criteria for a robustly validated prognostic model?\nA relevant body of scientific literature in the bio\ufffestatistical world agrees on the outstanding value of the\nreceiver operating curve analysis for the determination\nof the value of clinical prognostic scores [18-22]. There\ufffefore, we present in this paper a validation study on the\nrecently published Eurotransplant-Donor-Risk-Index\n(ET-DRI) and evaluate its value for prognostic decision\nmaking in the cohort of our center.\nThis study is a timely contribution to the urgently\nneeded debate on prognostic models in liver transplant\ufffeation with potential impact on donor organ allocation\npolicies. The recent liver transplant scandals in Germany\nrevolve around waiting list manipulations that affected\ndonor organ allocation directly and undermined public\ntrust in current donor organ policies [23].\nResults\nET-DRI score\nThe variables’ frequencies, range and percentages used\nin the ET-DRI of our study population are summarized\nin Table 1. The mean ET-DRI in this cohort was 1.79\n(median 1.70, range: 1.14 - 3.79).\nMajor results of the analyses of the ET-DRI’s predict\ufffeive capabilities for the study endpoints are summarized\nin Table 2.\nPrediction of 3-month mortality\nWith an AUROC of 0.477 (95%-CI: 0.390-0.564) the ET\ufffeDRI failed to predict 3-month mortality after liver trans\ufffeplantation in our study population (see Figure 1). This\nresult could be confirmed by binary logistic regression\n(p = 0.692). The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test\ndid show that the model fit of the logistic regression\nmodel was adequate (p = 0.542). Kaplan-Meier survival\nanalysis above versus below the calculated cut-off level\nof the ET-DRI for the prediction of 3-month mortality\n(2.06) did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.172,\nLog Rank; see Figure 2).\nPrediction of 1-year mortality\nFurther, the ET-DRI did not reach a relevant AUROC\nfor the prediction of 1-year mortality (AUROC 0.492)\n(see Table 2). A well fitted binary logistic regression\nmodel (p = 0.262, Hosmer-Lemeshow test) revealed no\nstatistically significant influence of the ET-DRI values on\n1-year mortality (p = 0.573). The calculated cut-off level\nfor this prediction is identical to the cut off for the pre\ufffediction of 3-month mortality. Therefore, it is no surprise\nthat the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis above versus\nbelow this cut-off level did also not reach statistical sig\ufffenificance (p = 0.230, Log Rank; see Figure 2).\nPrediction of 3-month graft survival\nWith an AUROC of 0.524 (95%CI: 0.447-0.601) the ET\ufffeDRI failed to predict 3-month graft survival after liver\ntransplantation in our study population (see Figure 3).\nFurther, investigation of the ET-DRI as a risk factor for\n3-month graft loss with a well fitted binary logistic re\ufffegression model (p = 0.491, Hosmer-Lemeshow test)\nremained insignificant (p = 0.475). Kaplan-Meier analysis\nof graft survival above versus below the determined cut\ufffeoff level for the prediction of 3-month graft survival did\nnot reach statistical significance (p = 0.655, Log Rank;\nsee Figure 4).\nPrediction of 1-year graft survival\nApplied to our data the ET-DRI is not able to predict\n1-year graft survival as shown by ROC-curve analysis re\ufffesults (AUROC = 0.540; 95%CI: 0.473-0.607). In binary\nlogistic regression, which was performed with adequate\nmodel goodness of fit (p = 0.631, Hosmer-Lemeshow\ntest), the ET-DRI was no statistically significant risk fac\ufffetor for graft loss within one year after transplantation\n(p = 0.163). Kaplan-Meier analysis of graft survival above\nversus below the determined cut-off level (1.84) did not\nreach statistical significance (p = 0.083, Log Rank).\nTable 1 Shown are the donor characteristics of our study\npopulation’s variables which are part of the ET-DRI model\nVariables\nn (%)\nCOD anoxia 24 (8.2%)\nCOD cerebrovascular accident 181 (62.1%)\nCOD other 86 (29.6%)\nDCD nil\nSplit LTX (yes/no) 20 (6.9%)\nregional share (yes/no) 253 (86.9%)\nnational share (yes/no) 38 (13.1%)\nrescue offer (yes/no) 53 (18.2%)\nage group <40 years 71 (24.4%)\n40 ≤ age < 50 (in years) 69 (23.7%)\n50 ≤ age < 60 (in years) 105 (36.1%)\n60 ≤ age < 70 (in years) 52 (17.9%)\n70 ≤ age (in years) 12 (4.1%)\nmean (median) range\nCIT in h 9.75 (9.6) 2.4 – 27.3\nlatest labGGT (U/L) 70.66 (43.0) 5 – 775\nAge in years 48.4 (51.0) 12 – 74\n(COD = cause of death, DCD = donation after cardiac death, LTX = liver\ntransplantation, CIT = cold ischemic time).\nReichert et al.

The rationale for a\nsufficient sample size in the presented study is the fact\nthat all 95%-CIs of the AUROCs are sufficiently narrow to\nexclude 0.700, the nominal criterion value for utility [20].\nDiscussion\nThe ET-DRI was originally developed with thousands of\npatients transplanted in the Eurotransplant region in\ufffecluding many transplant centers and the authors claimed\nthat the ET-DRI is of prognostic relevance for graft sur\ufffevival after liver transplantation [5]. We believe that the\nfundamental discrepancy to our results and interpret\ufffeation can be related to the fact that the ET-DRI as\nshown by Braat et al. cannot reach a c-index above 0.700\nfor the prediction of graft survival in thousands of liver\ntransplant recipients [5]. This finding could be con\ufffefirmed in our study with AUROCs <0.700.\nBraat et al. [5] used the previously published DRI [7]\nwhich was developed in the United States and they\nattempted to tailor and adapt the DRI to the donor\npopulation in the Eurotransplant region. The goal of our\nstudy was to test the ET-DRI as a prognostic model in\nour centre with current MELD-based liver allocation\nrules. Braat et al. used a dataset of recipients who were\ntransplanted in the vast majority of cases outside\nMELD-based organ allocation between 2003 and 2007.\nMELD-based liver allocation was introduced in Germany\nin December 2006 [5]. Braat et al. claimed in their paper\nwhich was published in 2012 that the ET-DRI should be\nused for liver allocation in the future [5]. We therefore\nbelieve that our analysis of the ET-DRI with a current\ncohort is fully justified in order to assess the potential\nmerit of the ET-DRI for the future. Braat and colleagues\nclearly stated quite righteously that Eurotransplant is di\ufffevided into different regions; i.e. for Austria, Belgium/\nLuxembourg, Croatia, the Netherlands and Slovenia\neach country is considered as one region, whereas\nGermany is divided into seven regions. Therefore the\nterm allocation is divided into local (transplant center is\nin the procurement area), regional (transplantation and\nprocurement area within the same country, or region in\nGermany), and national or extra-regional (anywhere in\nEurotransplant, but outside the region) [5]. Interestingly,\nthe ET-DRI calculation formula as shown by Braat et al.\ndoes not contain a criterion for local share. Our analysis\nof the influence of local versus regional versus national\nshare on transplant outcome did not show a significant\nimpact of local share on outcomes in our cohort\n(p < 0.05; Chi2\n).\nCurrently, Avolio et al. have claimed that ROC-curve\nanalysis is not the adequate measure to assess the value\nof prognostic models for graft or patient survival, espe\ufffecially if they include donor organ variables. Additionally,\nthey postulated that it would be preferable to use time\ufffedependent ROC-curve analysis [17]. This notion is an\nexpansion of the current thinking as expressed in the\nmajority of recent bio-statistical publications [18-21].\nSensitivity, specificity and area under the ROC-curve are\noften used to measure the ability of survival models to\npredict future risk [18-21]. Estimation of these parame\ufffeters is complicated by the fact that these parameters are\nTable 2 Shown are the results of the analyses of the study endpoints\nEndpoint ET-DRI cut off values\nAUROC 95%-CI Logistic regression p-value Sensitivity Specificity Overall correctness\n3-month mortality 0.477 0.390-0.564 p = 0.692 2.06 26.7% 81.4% 54%\n1-year mortality 0.492 0.405-0.579 p = 0.573 2.06 26.7% 81.4% 54%\n3-month graft survival 0.524 0.477-0.601 p = 0.475 1.95 38% 74.5% 56.3%\n1-year graft survival 0.540 0.473-0.607 p = 0.475 1.84 47.4% 63.6% 55.5%\nAUROC = area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; 95%-CI = 95%-Confidence Interval\nFigure 1 Shown is the ROC-Curve for the prediction of 3-month\nmortality after liver transplantation with the ET-DRI (AUROC =\n0.477; 95%CI: 0.390-0.564).\nReichert et al.

Furthermore, censoring affects their es\ufffetimation just as it affects estimation of survival curves or\ncoefficients of survival regression models [22]. In the\npresented study only relatively short time windows\nhave been investigated. Therefore, application of time\ufffedependent ROC-curve analysis is in our view not\njustified.\nThere is currently no objective score for the assess\ufffement of donor organ quality available that would be able\nto predict short-term patient and graft survival with ac\ufffeceptable overall correctness ((sensitivity + specificity)/2).\nIt appears safe to assume that extended donor criteria\norgans with extreme properties would affect graft sur\ufffevival negatively in the short-term and lead to initial graft\nnon-function which is known to be associated with in\ufffecreased patient mortality [1,2,4-9,14,15]. Current prog\ufffenostic scores for donor organ quality are unable to\ndemonstrate significant statistical influences on short\ufffeterm graft survival as robust prognostic tools\n[1,2,4-10,12-15]. We believe that these currently avail\ufffeable scores may have missed potentially critical parame\ufffeters and/or combinations of donor organ variables and/\nor their interaction that may be critical for a robust\nprognostic score to predict short-term graft survival with\nacceptable overall correctness. The design of many prog\ufffenostic scores in the medical literature, including the ET\ufffeDRI has failed so far to assess multivariable co-linearity\nof the influences of variables on the target output vari\ufffeable (e.g. graft survival) [5,18,26].\nHanley and McNeil have shown that c is identical to a\nwidely used measure of diagnostic discrimination, the\nAUROC in ROC-curve analysis [20,21]. A value of c of\n0.5 indicates random prediction and a value of 1 indicates\nn=231 (79.4%)\nn=60 (20.6%)\nFigure 2 Kaplan Meier survival analysis above and below the ET-DRI cut-off values for the prediction of 3-month mortality (2.06) shows\nthat this cut-off value has no significant influence on long-term survival (p = 0.172; Log Rank). The curve clearly demonstrates that the\nET-DRI has no influence on long-term survival and limited influence on survival within the first 90 days.\nFigure 3 Shown is the ROC-Curve for the prediction of 3-month\ngraft survival after liver transplantation with the ET-DRI\n(AUROC of 0.524 (95%CI: 0.447-0.601, SD 0.039).\nReichert et al. Journal of Negative Results in BioMedicine 2013, 12:18 Page 4 of 8\nhttp://www.jnrbm.com/content/12/1/18\n\nperfect prediction. A model having c greater than roughly\n0.7 has some utility in predicting the responses of individ\ufffeual subjects [21]. The c-index 0.624 which was published\nbefore for the prediction of graft survival with the ET-DRI\nin a large Eurotransplant cohort [5] appears therefore as a\nmeasure of limited utility of this score.\nThis study is limited by the relatively small number of\nenrolled patients (n = 291). However, none of the 95%\nCIs included a relevant AUROC >0.700. Moreover, organ\nprocurement from donors after cardiac death is a rele\ufffevant factor of the original population, in which the ET\ufffeDRI was created [5]. Unfortunately we were not able to\ninclude this specific donor group, because liver donation\nafter cardiac death is not applied in Germany. Thus, the\nresults of this analysis may be confounded by the ab\ufffesence of these cases.\nTaken together we believe that the ET-DRI or any\nother donor risk score should not be used for donor\norgan allocation rules without adequate criticism of its\nmethodological limitations. The transplant community\ndesperately needs a debate on the power and limitations\nof prognostic scores in liver transplantation which\nshould lead to a consensus. In our opinion Jacob et al.\nhave made a reasonable proposal for the quality assess\ufffement of prognostic models for liver transplantation [18].\nThe application of a previously developed score to a\nnew dataset premises that the characteristics of both refer\ufffeence and study populations should result in overlapping\nor at least should present similar patterns [17]. This ex\ufffepectation is met with our study population which is a sub\ufffeset of the Eurotransplant population which was used by\nBraat and colleagues [5].\nWe believe that the reasons for our findings which\nsomehow contrast the previously published findings [5]\nare maybe due to a strong center bias. This notion is\nlikely because our population constitutes a subpopula\ufffetion of the one that was investigated by Braat et al. [5].\nFurther, the fact that at least two transplant centers\nwithin the Eurotransplant region are known to believe\nthat rescue allocated organs do not affect outcome after\nof liver transplantation [27,28] and the fact that the per\ufffecentage of accepted rescue allocated livers for trans\ufffeplantation differs widely within the Eurotransplant\nregion may contribute to this center bias. In our center\nthe percentage of rescue allocated livers was compara\ufffetively low (18.2%) while approximately 30% of livers in\nthe Eurotransplant region are transplanted after rescue\nallocation [27].\nAnother critical aspect in donor organ assessment is\nthe histological diagnostics. Not all donor livers are bi\ufffeopsied. Moreover, the frequency of biopsies is com\ufffepletely dependent on the indication to perform a\nhistological examination. This subjective and irregular\nindication is the responsibility of the explant surgeon or\nthe accepting transplant center. Recently, two studies de\ufffescribed the importance of steatosis as a donor risk factor\nn=191 (65.6%)\nn=100 (34.4%)\nFigure 4 Kaplan Meier survival analysis above and below the ET-DRI cut-off values for the prediction of 3-month graft survival (1.95)\nshows that this cut-off value has no significant influence on long-term graft survival (p = 0.655; Log Rank). The curve clearly\ndemonstrates that the ET-DRI has no influence on long-term graft survival.\nReichert et al. Journal of Negative Results in BioMedicine 2013, 12:18 Page 5 of 8\nhttp://www.jnrbm.com/content/12/1/18\n\n[29,30]. Spitzer et al. [30] concluded that steatosis should\nbe added to the DRI, when dealing with a high-risk\ndonor. However, objective evaluation of the range of\nsteatosis, either as macro- or microvesicular steatosis, is\nnot standardized so far subjective to some degree [29].\nWe believe that routine donor biopsy evaluation may en\ufffeable the design of more powerful and robust donor risk\nscores.\nWe believe that the prognostic power of the DRI and\nET-DRI is further significantly undermined by the fact\nthat graft acceptance decisions on offered organs for\ntransplantation are not documented and evaluated in\nthese scores. There is an urgent need to evaluate and ad\ufffedress this shortcoming immediately, especially on the\nbackground of the current liver transplant scandals in\nGermany [23,31]. We believe that this aspect is a rele\ufffevant issue in liver transplantation today. Transplant cen\ufffeters regard their graft acceptance policy as their\npotential advantage in a highly competitive area for a\nvery scarce resource in times of ubiquitous organ short\ufffeage. It can be assumed that these aspects of potentially\nunwanted transparency by the proponents of transplant\ufffeation stood in the way of previous attempts to generate\nrobust prognostic scores that include donor organ qual\ufffeity. This may represent a deeper reason for the notorious\ndifficulty to assess donor organ quality and its impact on\nprognosis after transplantation objectively.\nThe balance of equity and utility in donor organ allo\ufffecation is a serious ethical dilemma. Several risk predic\ufffetion models are available and their head to head\ncomparisons would benefit from standardized reporting\nand formal, consistent statistical evaluation [18,26]. It\nwas claimed previously and in a different context that\noutcome selection and optimism biases may affect litera\ufffeture on prognostic scores in medicine [26].\nWe would like to propose joint efforts to develop a ro\ufffebust and objective donor risk score in an international\ncollaboration that should include the available large\ndata-sets from multiple institutions. We believe that the\ntime has come for a consensus on the reporting of the\nreasons for declined organ offers and on quality stan\ufffedards for prognostic scores and their statistical analysis\nand validation. Jacob et al. [18] proposed a reasonable\nscientific approach to the latter. High quality scientific\njournals should make uniform requirements mandatory\nfor the reporting of prognostic scores.\nConclusion\nThe results of this current study clearly show that the\nET-DRI is not applicable in the population from our\ncenter within the Eurotransplant community for the pre\ufffediction of patient or graft survival. On the background\nof a paucity of proper prognostic models, justified organ\nallocation which weighs urgency against prediction of\nsuccess of liver transplantation must be the aim of future\nresearch in this field.\nPatients and methods\nEthics statement\nAs an observational retrospective study, according to the\nProfessional Code of the German Medical Association\n(article B.III. § 15.1), neither informed consent nor ap\ufffeproval of the ethics committee was needed for this\nstudy.\nPatients\n291 consecutive liver transplants were included to\nanalyze the model’s accuracy and applicability for this\ndataset of a major transplant centre in the Eurotrans\ufffeplant community. Included were 20 (6.9%) split liver\ntransplants, 30 (10.3%) acute re-transplants (retransplan\ufffetation within 30 days after the previous transplant) and\n25 (8.6%) chronic retransplants (primary transplantation\nn = 235, secondary transplantation n = 48, tertiary trans\ufffeplantation n = 6, quaternary transplantation n = 1) in a\ntotal of 257 patients (median age: 49.6 years, range: 18–\n69 years; males n = 177 (64.4%), females n = 114 (35.6%),\nratio males/females: 1.8). All transplants were performed\nin our centre between the 01/01/2007 and the 12/31/\n2010. The post-transplant observational period ended on\nthe 12/31/2011. Indications leading to liver transplant\ufffeation as well as the most probable leading causes of\ndeath in our cohort are summarized in Tables 3 and 4.\nStudy end-points\nPrimary study endpoints were 3-month and 1-year pa\ufffetient mortality and 3-month and 1-year graft survival.\n(Graft survival and failure free survival (FFS) are syno\ufffenyms that describe the time period from date of trans\ufffeplantation until the date of retransplantation or recipient\ndeath).\nStatistical analysis\nFor the primary study endpoints ROC-curve analysis was\nperformed to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, and\noverall model correctness of the ET-DRI as a predictive\nmodel. AUROCS larger than 0.7 indicate a clinically\nuseful prognostic model [18-22]. The respective cut-off\nvalues of the potential prognostic models were deter\ufffemined with the best Youden index (Youden index =\nsensitivity + specificity – 1) [24]. If possible, the Hosmer\ufffeLemeshow Chi2\n-statistic goodness-of-fit test was applied\nto assess model calibration of the binary logistic regres\ufffesion models. These statistics suggest good fit when the\nassociated p-values are greater than 0.05 [21,25]. Survival\nanalysis was performed with the Kaplan-Meier method.\nThe statistical influence of the determined cut-off values\non patient and graft survival was analyzed with the Log\nReichert et al.

Binary logistic regression was performed as\nadditional test to determine the influence of the ET-DRI\non study end-points. For all statistical tests a p-value\n<0.05 was defined as significant. The SPSS statistics soft\ufffeware version 20.0 (IBM, Somers, NY, USA) was used to\nperform statistical analysis.\nCalculation of the ET-DRI\nThe ET-DRI was calculated as described before with this\nformula [5]:\nET-DRI = exp[0.960((0.154 if 40 ≤ age < 50) + (0.274If\n50 ≤ age < 60) + (0.424 if 60 ≤ age < 70) + (0.501 if 70 ≤\nage) + (0.079 if COD = anoxia) + (0.145 if COD = cere\ufffebrovascular accident) + (0.184 if COD = other) + (0.411\nif DCD) + (0.422 if partial/split) + (0.105 if regional\nshare) + (0.244 if national share)) + (0.010 × (cold ischemia\ntime − 8 h)) +0.06((latest lab GGT (U/L)- 50)/100) +\n(0.180 if rescue offer)].\nRegional share was defined by Braat et al. as allocation\nwithin Germany and national share as allocation within\nEurotransplant land [5].\nData collection\nThis is a single centre analysis complemented by on\ufffegoing data collection.\nSetting\nThe setting of the study is a university hospital in\nGermany within the Eurotransplant community.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nIncluded were all consecutive liver transplants per\ufffeformed in adult recipients (minimum age 18 years). Ex\ufffecluded were all combined transplants (e.g. combined\nliver and kidney transplantation) and living-related organ\ndonor transplants.\nTable 3 Shown are the indications for liver\ntransplantation in the study population\nIndications for liver transplantation: %\nacute liver failure 10.3\nalcoholic cirrhosis 8.6\nalpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency 1.4\nautoimmune hepatitis 1.0\nbiliary atresia 0.7\nBudd Chiari syndrome 2.1\ncryptogenic cirrhosis 5.5\nfamilial amyloidotic polyneuropathy 1.0\nHBV HCV related cirrhosis 0.3\nHBV related cirrhosis 4.5\nHCC 19.6\nHCV related cirrhosis 5.5\nintrahepatic CCC 0.7\nM.

The study analyzed a current cohort of 296 patients who received liver transplantation in Hannover, Germany between January 2008 and December 2011. The ET-DRI was calculated for each patient based on donor characteristics, and the study evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and overall correctness of the ET-DRI in predicting 3-month and 1-year mortality and graft survival using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The study found that the ET-DRI failed to predict short-term patient and graft survival with acceptable sensitivity and specificity, similar to previous findings for the Donor-Risk-Index, ECD-Score, and D-MELD-Score. These results suggest that none of these scores accurately predict short-term outcomes after liver transplantation. The study highlights the need for continued development of objective scores for assessing donor organ quality and optimizing donor-recipient matching.",0.8888888888888888,0.8463055231424601,FULL_PAPER
How has the evidence changed regarding acceptable macro/microsteatosis in liver grafts?,"['J Clin Pathol 1985;38:1366-1373\nBiopsy findings in cases of rejection of liver allograft\nSG HUBSCHER, D CLEMENTS,* E ELIAS,* P McMASTERt\nFrom the Department ofPathology, The Medical School, University ofBirmingham, and the Departments of\n*Medicine and tSurgery, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Edgbaston, Birmingham\nSUMMARY Features of rejection were found in 21 needle biopsies obtained from seven patients after\nliver transplantation. Wedge biopsies taken peroperatively were used as a baseline for comparison.\nRejection was diagnosed by excluding other known causes of graft dysfunction using appropriate\nmethods. In cases in which these criteria were fulfilled a consistent picture of rejection was seen, and\nthis was useful in clinical management. Two features constantly present in cases of acute rejection\nwere: a dense mixed portal inflammatory infiltrate; and polymorphonuclear infiltration of biliary\nepithelium.\nEarly studies of liver allograft pathology that were\nprimarily based on necropsy findings ascribed a wide\nrange of lesions to rejection.`3 Liver biopsies were\nrarely performed during this period, and interpreting\nthem was difficult.45 Recent studies illustrate the use\ufffefulness of performing serial biopsies for the diagnosis\nand management of rejection, although there are still\ndifferences in the histological features ascribed to\nrejection.67\nThe purpose of our study was to determine whether\nconsistent and reliable histological features of rejec\ufffetion could be identified in biopsies from patients in\nwhom other causes of graft dysfunction had been\nexcluded.\nMaterial and methods\nCLINICAL DATA\nTwenty-three patients underwent orthotopic liver\ntransplantation at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital\nbetween January 1982 and May 1985. Biopsies were\nperformed to assess graft dysfunction in 10 of the last\n15 patients who had undergone surgery (orthotopic\nliver transplants, O.L. 10-O.L. 24). In all cases a diag\ufffenosis of rejection was supported by the exclusion of\nother known causes of graft dysfunction. Infection\nwas excluded by bile culture and cytomegalovirus\ncomplement serology; biliary obstruction by T tube\ncholangiography; and ischaemia by a combination of\nclinical, radiological, and histological criteria. All\npatients had an internal T tube until three months\nafter the operation: this allowed regular bile culture\nand cholangiography to be carried out. Hepatic arte\uffferiography was performed to exclude hepatic artery\nthrombosis in one patient (case 1).\nAccepted for publication 21 August 1985\nThree of the 10 biopsied patients were considered\nto have graft dysfunction due to factors other than\nrejection and were therefore excluded from this study.\nIn these three cases (O.L. 11, 12, and 20) severe per\ufffeoperative technical problems occurred, which resulted\nin considerable loss of blood. Further haemorrhage\nand hypotension complicated the postoperative\ncourse, and wedge biopsies for bleeding obtained at\nrepeat laparotomy showed centrilobular to sub\ufffemassive necrosis compatible with ischaemic damage.\nAll three died 15-24 days after transplantation, and\nnecropsy confirmed the presence of extensive hepatic\ninfarction and opportunistic infection.\nTable 1 summarises the clinical details of the\nremaining seven patients and the timing of their biop\ufffesies.\nHISTOLOGICAL DATA\nPeroperative wedge biopsies were carried out as a\nbaseline assessment in all seven patients. Twenty one\npercutaneous biopsies were obtained using a Men\ufffeghini needle (16G or 17G, 1-4mm or 16mm\ndiameter). Biopsy specimens were fixed in formalin\nand embedded in paraffin. Sections were stained with\nhaematoxylin and eosin, reticulin, van Gieson, peri\ufffeodic acid Schiff (with and without diastase digestion),\nOrcein, and Perls\'s iron stain. In one patient (case 2)\na hepatectomy specimen was available for study. In\nanother patient (case 1) the liver obtained at necropsy\nwas examined.\nTable 2 summarises the features that were assessed.\nThe severity of portal inflammation was graded semi\ufffequantitatively according to the proportion of portal\nareas affected and the intensity of inflammation\nwithin them.

Other changes\nwere similarly graded in a semiquantitative manner.\nResults\nPEROPERATIVE BIOPSIES\nAbnormalities were invariably present in the per\ufffeoperative biopsy specimens, although these were usu\ufffeally unimportant. All seven showed centrilobular\nhepatocyte vacuolation and necrosis. In four cases\nthere was bridging necrosis and frank subcapsular\ninfarction. All the histological changes seen in these\nbiopsies improved on subsequent biopsy, although\ntwo cases showed persistent centrilobular necrosis or\nfibrosis, or both (cases 1 and 2). The severity of\nchanges seen in peroperative biopsy specimens was\nnot related to the cold ischaemic time.\nPOSTOPERATIVE BIOPSIES\nHistological changes of rejection were seen between\nsix days and five months after transplantation\n(Table 2).\nPORTAL INFLAMMATION AND BILE DUCT\nDAMAGE\nAcute rejection was characterised by a dense mixed\nportal inflammatory infiltrate composed mainly of\nlymphocytes and neutrophils with smaller numbers of\n1367\nplasma cells, macrophages, and eosinophils. A partic\ufffeularly striking finding was the presence of poly\ufffemorphs surrounding and infiltrating the epithelium of\nsmall bile ducts and ductules (Fig. 1). This was associ\ufffeated with a variable degree of nuclear hyper\ufffechromatism and cytoplasmic vacuolation of the bili\ufffeary epithelium. These acute changes were seen in nine\nbiopsy specimens taken six to 18 days after trans\ufffeplantation.\nIn one patient (case 2) the acute bile duct lesion was\nfollowed by complete loss of ducts on the 28th day\nafter transplantation (Fig. 2) and led to graft failure\nnecessitating retransplantation. In another patient\n(case 1) acute inflammation subsided, but bile duct\nepithelium showed severe focal atypia resembling that\nseen in graft v host disease (Fig. 3).8 In the remaining\nfive cases treatment with immunosuppression resulted\nin clinical improvement and resolution of histological\nchanges, although a residual, mild and predominantly\nmononuclear infiltrate persisted in all these cases.\nThe hepatectomy specimen removed for chronic\nrejection (case 2) showed complete absence of small\nbile ducts. Larger ducts showed features similar to\nthose noted in smaller ducts in previous biopsies with\nthe additional finding of numerous foamy histiocytes\nin surrounding connective tissue (Fig. 4). A small\namount of material resistant to diastase and positive\nfor periodic acid Schiff was present in their cyto\ufffeplasm, but fat stains yielded a negative result.\nTable 1 Clinical details ofpatients and timing of biopsies after transplantation\nCase Age and Original diagnosis No of Timing of biopsy Follow up\nNo sex biopsies (day after graft)\nI O.L. 10 40 F Primary biliary cirrhosis 2 90, 102 Died at 5 months\n2 O.L. 15 41 F Primary biliary cirrhosis 3 15, 28, 56 Regraft at 2 months and\nalive at 9 months\n3 O.L. 18 46 F Primary biliary cirrhosis 3 7, 28, 38 Alive at 5 months\n4 O.L. 19 40 F Primary biliary cirrhosis 3 6, 20, 28 Alive at 5 months\n5 O.L. 21 35 F Cryptogenic cirrhosis 4 15, 18, 30, 42 Alive at 4 months\n6 O.L. 22 15 F Cryptogenic cirrhosis 2 7, 48 Alive at 2 months\n7 O.L. 24 15 M al antitrypsin deficiency 4 6, 12, 16, 40 Alive at 2 months\nTable 2 Histologicalfindings in 21 biopsies taken after transplantation\nFeatures assessed Degree of abnormality\nMild or moderate Severe\nPortal changes:\nInflammation 12 9\nPolymorphonuclear infiltration of biliary epithelium 5 9\nVascular changes:\nArterial intimal hyperplasia 3 0\nPortal vein endothelial inflammation 8 3\nCentral vein endothelial inflammation 3 2\nLobular changes:\nCholestasis 7 11\nCentrilobular necrosis or fibrosis 5 0\nAcidophil bodies (solitary) 10 0\n(clusters) 3 0\nPolymorph aggregates 4 0\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n.

Most cases were\ngraded as mild or moderate and showed occasional\nlymphocytes adherent to the luminal surface of\nvenular endothelium and focal endothelial hyper\ufffeplasia.\nIn three cases graded as severe there was sub\ufffeendothelial infla\'mmation and disruption of the endo\ufffethelium (Fig. 5). These were biopsies performed six\ndays (case 4) and seven days (cases 3 and 5) after\ntransplantation. Inflammation rapidly subsided after\nimmunosuppressive treatment, although mild\ninflammation was seen in subsequent biopsies.\nChanges in hepatic artery branches were rarely\nfound and usually only present to a minor degree. In\ntwo cases (one necropsy specimen, case 1; one sur\ufffegically removed liver, case 2) there was subendothelial\naccumulation of lipid laden macrophages causing\nsevere luminal narrowing of large arterial branches in\nthe hepatic porta (Fig. 6). This change was present at\nfive and two months, respectively. In both cases pre\ufffevious biopsies had shown centrilobular necrosis and\nreticulin collapse suggestive of ischaemic damage, but\nno abnormalities had been seen in small arteries.\nHubscher, Clements, Elias, McMaster\nCHOLESTASIS\nCentrilobular cholestasis was a common, though not\nuniversal, feature of acute rejection, being virtually\nabsent in one patient (case 3) whose biopsy had the\ntypical portal changes described above. In the other\npatients (cases 4, 5, 6, and 7), whose portal changes\nresolved after immunosuppression, cholestasis persis\ufffeted in subsequent biopsies performed up to 28 days\nlater and caused difficulty in interpretation. In one\ncase (5) the presence of worsening cholestasis with\nbile infarcts and a small bile lake suggested the possi\ufffebility of large duct obstruction, which was excluded\nradiologically. Continued treatment with low dose\nimmunosuppression resulted in gradual clinical and\nbiochemical recovery in all these cases and histologi\ufffecally, bile pigment was reduced in canaliculi and\nincreased in the cytoplasm of Kupffer cells.\nLOBULAR INFLAMMATION AND ACIDOPHIL\nBODIES\nInflammation was often present in centrilobular areas\nin association with degeneration of hepatocytes due\nto bile stasis. In four biopsy specimens tiny discrete\npolymorph clusters unrelated to cholestasis were scat\ufffetered randomly within the lobules (Fig. 7).

Viral\ninclusions or serological evidence of viral infection\nwere not present in any of these cases.\nDiscussion\nLiver biopsy has a potentially useful part to play in\nthe diagnosis and management of liver allograft rejec\ufffetion as there are no specific clinical, biochemical, or\nother markers of rejection. In view of the liver\'s\nlimited range of responses to injury other causes of\ngraft dysfunction should be excluded before any\nchanges seen are ascribed to rejection. Failure to do\nso may account for the difficulty experienced in inter\ufffepreting biopsies in early series.45 Necropsy studies are\nalso unhelpful as a guide to interpreting biopsy speci\ufffemens during life as the changes of rejection are often\nadvanced and may be indistinguishable from other\ncomplications that contribute to death.9""0\nApplying the criteria of exclusion, two recent stud\ufffeies, one prospective6 and the other retrospective,7\nreported that biopsies were useful in the clinical man\ufffeagement of patients with rejection. In both reports\nseveral biopsies were performed on each patient\nallowing the evolution of lesions and their\nmodification by treatment to be monitored.\nIn this study the most consistent and diagnostically\nuseful feature of acute rejection was the presence of a\nmixed portal inflammatory infiltrate, together with\n""Iv\nt.\n4..S\nJF BYF_^! .. .4 .. xpt q> ... * *4*s\' a ..\n^ .9"" *, waS\n.,. ^ * s. .ts w :*S\n:s\n..\n$ X w £ .ws\n_ .X\nFig. 8 Biopsy specimen 15 days after transplantation (case\n2) showing small periportal collection ofacidophil bodies.\n(Haematoxylin and eosin.) x 450.\nthe highly characteristic lesion of acute bile duct dam\ufffeage by polymorphs. This agrees with the findings of\nSnover et al7 but differs from those of Eggink et al,6\nwho describe a picture similar to chronic active hepa\ufffetitis without evidence of destruction of bile ducts. The\nreason for this disparity is uncertain. One possible\nexplanation is a difference in immunosuppression as\ncyclosporin A is used routinely in Minnesota and\nBirmingham after the immediate postoperative\nperiod while the Dutch group continue treatment\nwith azathioprine. Early reports of rejection before\nthe advent of cyclosporin A also described spillover of\nportal inflammation into lobules, a particularly strik\ufffeing example being seen in one patient in whom immu\ufffenosuppression was deliberately withheld because of\npossible viral infection (Fig I in Williams et al2). A\nsimilar process has been described in untreated canine\nallografts. 1 12\nThe bile duct lesion seen in rejection has been lik\ufffeened to that which occurs in primary biliary cirrhosis\nand graft v host disease (GVHD) and a unifying\nmechanism proposed for duct damage in these three\nconditions based on their anatomical similarity.1314\nThe susceptibility of bile ducts to damage by rejection\nmay be due to expression of HLA class IV5 or class\n1116 antigens, neither of which is normally expressed\non hepatocytes.\'718 Similar mechanisms have been\nproposed for bile duct damage in primary biliary\ncirrhosis19 and chronic GVHD.20\nAlthough similar mechanisms could account for\nthe apparent selectivity of bile duct damage in these\nthree conditions, the histological features of acute\n1371\n.* I\n41 ,\n0 W\'WF\nJ&\n4\' flq I.:..\nV\nI :.\'\nAO%L\nlb\nI Protected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n.

The presence of numerous poly\ufffemorphs surrounding and infiltrating the wall of bile\nducts was a consistent feature of acute rejection and\ndid not occur to any important degree in the two\nother cases. A polymorphonuclear infiltrate related to\nbile ducts might suggest a diagnosis of ascending cho\ufffelangitis.6 In all our cases polymorphs were absent\nfrom the biliary lumen, and infection was excluded by\nbile culture.\nDisappearance of bile ducts was first described as a\ncomplication of transplantation by Calne et al and\nhas been ascribed to chronic immune mediated bile\nduct damage,""4 ischaemia related to poor surgical\ntechnique,6 and ischaemia due to chronic vascular\nrejection (DGD Wight, personal communication).\nThe pattern of damage and course of events in our\npatient with disappearing duct syndrome (case 2) is\nmore in favour of immune mediated rather than\nischaemic damage. The resemblance of bile duct dam\ufffeage in the other patient with chronic rejection (case 1,\nFig. 3) to that seen in chronic GVHD also favours an\nimmunological mechanism.\nVenous endothelial changes of acute rejection were\nnot seen to an important degree in this study, in con\ufffetrast to the findings of Snover et al,7 who included\nthese as part of their diagnostic triad of acute rejec\ufffetion (portal inflammation, bile duct damage, and\nendothelialitis of portal or central veins). Endothelial\ndamage was also a regular finding in the study of\nDemetris et al.2"" This disparity may be a consequence\nof differences in immunosuppressive regimens and the\ntiming of biopsies. Endothelial inflammation, a strik\ufffeing feature of uncontrolled acute rejection in\nanimals\'2 and man,2 rapidly resolves following\nimmunosuppression and is not described in chronic\nrejection.\nArterial changes of rejection may be prominent in\nlarge intrahepatic arteries but not seen in needle biop\ufffesies which only sample small vessels. Their presence\nmay be suspected in biopsies if centrilobular necrosis\nor fibrosis is seen and other causes of hypoperfusion\nare excluded.\nCentrilobular cholestasis is a common finding in\nrejection and is possibly a consequence of bile duct\ndamage. It is not an invariable finding, being minimal\nin one patient whose biopsies had typical portal and\nbile duct lesions. Persistence and even worsening of\ncholestasis may occur after the successful treatment\nof acute rejection. This may lead to difficulty in histo\ufffelogical diagnosis and clinical management, particu\ufffelarly if a biopsy performed during the acute episode is\nnot available for comparison. It is our experience that\nif other causes of cholestasis have been excluded it\nis not associated with an adverse prognosis and\nHubscher, Clements, Elias, McMaster\nresolves without additional immunosuppression. We\ndid not see any examples corresponding to the picture\nof pure or functional cholestasis described in other\nstudies.621\nThe presence of polymorph and acidophil clusters\nscattered randomly within lobules is a finding of\nunknown importance. Although suggestive of viral\ninfection, no inclusions or serological evidence of\nviral infection were present in any of the patients. In\nthe absence of more sensitive probes for detecting\ncytomegalovirus and other viruses in sections22 the\npossibility that these lesions represent occult viral\ninfection cannot be excluded, although their clinical\nimportance is uncertain in patients with other histo\ufffelogical features of rejection and clinical improvement\nwith immunosuppression.\nAbnormalities were invariably present in per\ufffeoperative biopsies, in contrast to the findings of Egg\ufffeink et al,6 and are probably a reflection of more pro\ufffelonged cold ischaemic times. None of the abnormal\nfeatures noted in the baseline biopsies had any appar\ufffeent adverse prognostic importance.\nIn conclusion, the present study showed that liver\nbiopsies were useful in the diagnosis and management\nof rejection after transplantation. If other causes of\ngraft dysfunction are excluded the changes seen and\ndescribed here are highly characteristic. A mixed por\ufffetal inflammatory infiltrate and polymorphonuclear\ninfiltration of biliary epithelium are the two most con\ufffesistent and diagnostically useful features of acute\nrejection of liver allografts. Both changes rapidly\nresolve after successful immunosuppressive treatment\nand are associated with clinical and biochemical\nrecovery.\nWe thank Dr AJ Howie for helpful criticism of the\nmanuscript and Mr AA Cooper for photographic\nhelp.\nReferences\n\' Starzl TE, Paterk A, Brettschneider L, et al.

The authors describe the characteristics of acute rejection, such as a mixed portal inflammatory infiltrate and polymorphonuclear infiltration of biliary epithelium, which rapidly resolve with successful immunosuppressive treatment and are associated with clinical and biochemical recovery. They also note the presence of inflammation in perioperative biopsies, which may reflect longer cold ischemia times. The authors emphasize that the changes seen in liver biopsies are highly characteristic and diagnostic of acute rejection, even in the absence of other histological features. Additionally, they mention the occurrence of cholestasis in some cases, but note its lack of association with an adverse prognosis. Overall, the authors conclude that liver biopsies are useful in diagnosing and managing rejection after liver transplantation.",0.9333333333333333,0.8707064150389137,FULL_PAPER

Friend1\n* for the Consortium for Organ \nPreservation in Europe\nLiver transplantation is a highly successful treatment, but is severely limited by the shortage in donor organs. However, \nmany potential donor organs cannot be used; this is because sub-optimal livers do not tolerate conventional cold storage \nand there is no reliable way to assess organ viability preoperatively. Normothermic machine perfusion maintains the liver \nin a physiological state, avoids cooling and allows recovery and functional testing. Here we show that, in a randomized trial \nwith 220 liver transplantations, compared to conventional static cold storage, normothermic preservation is associated \nwith a 50% lower level of graft injury, measured by hepatocellular enzyme release, despite a 50% lower rate of organ \ndiscard and a 54% longer mean preservation time. There was no significant difference in bile duct complications, graft \nsurvival or survival of the patient. If translated to clinical practice, these results would have a major impact on liver \ntransplant outcomes and waiting list mortality.\nLiver transplantation is the accepted treatment for end-stage liver \nfailure, with one and five year survivals in excess of 90% and 70%, \nrespectively1\n. With increasing rates of liver disease2\n, the supply of \ntransplantable organs is no longer able to meet demand. Paradoxically, \ndespite substantial waiting list mortality (for example, 21% in the UK), \nonly 63% of UK deceased donor livers are transplanted1\n. Increasing \nnumbers of deceased organ donors in many countries have not been \nmatched by a corresponding rise in the number of transplantable \norgans. This is mainly because these additional donors tend to be \nhigh-risk—either declared dead by cardiovascular criteria (DCD), as \nopposed to brainstem death donors (DBD), or elderly with multiple \nco-morbidities (extended criteria donors). Such organs pose a greater \nrisk to the recipient, with a higher probability that the liver will never \nfunction (primary non-function (PNF)) or that it will lead to later com\ufffeplications, particularly biliary stricturing.\nDespite many advances in liver transplantation, the method of \norgan preservation has changed very little in almost 30 years3\n. The \nliver is flushed and cooled with specialist preservation fluid, then \nstored in an icebox. This process of static cold storage (SCS) has \nseveral limitations. Although SCS slows metabolism by 10- to 12-fold, \nsubstantial anaerobic activity continues even at ice temperature4\n. \nThis leads to ATP depletion and accumulation of succinate and other \nmetabolites. These lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species5\nthat are the basis of ischaemia–reperfusion injury, when the organ \nis re-exposed to oxygenated blood at the time of transplantation. \nThis damage, exacerbated by any prior injury, limits the maximum safe \npreservation time of the donor organ. Once cooled, the cessation of \nnormal cellular activity also makes functional assessment impossible.\nThese shortcomings are particularly problematic in the higher-risk \ndonor organs that form an increasing proportion of current liver \ntransplant practice. The very severe ischaemia–reperfusion-related \nmorbidity that characterizes transplantation of such organs is now a \nmajor limitation in meeting the demand for life-saving transplants. To \ncombat the limitations imposed by cold storage, a change in preser\ufffevation technology is required. In recent years, interest has developed \nin perfusion at physiological temperature (normothermic machine \nperfusion (NMP))6–9\n.\nDuring NMP, the liver is perfused with oxygenated blood, med\ufffeications and nutrients at normal body temperature to maintain a \nphysiological milieu. Evidence from animal models of both DBD \nand DCD liver transplantation10,11 suggests that this improves \nthe post-transplant survival of transplanted livers, and potentially \nenables the assessment of organ viability during preservation. The \nmechanism underlying these improved outcomes is at least partly \nrelated to the metabolic resuscitation of the organ that occurs with \npreservation under physiological conditions. This has been demon\ufffestrated through the replenishment of ATP levels11, which in turn con\ufffetributes to a reduction in the severity of the ischaemia–reperfusion \ninjury that is experienced after transplant5,10.\nThere is increasing interest in the clinical application of NMP, with \nseveral cases described in the recent literature6,7\n. In 2013, a phase-I \nstudy by our group9\n, demonstrated the safety and feasibility of NMP in \n1Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. 2Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. 3Queen \nElizabeth Hospital Birmingham, Birmingham, UK. 4Target Discovery Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. 5University of Cambridge Department of Surgery, Addenbrooke’s Hospital, \nCambridge, UK. 6Centre for Statistics in Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. 7Surgical Intervention Trials Unit, Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. \n8Oxford Clinical Trials Research Unit, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. 9Department of Hepatobiliopancreatic and Transplant Surgery, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain. 10Institute of Liver Studies, \nKing’s College Hospital, London, UK. 11Department of Hepatopancreatobiliary and Liver Transplant Surgery, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK. 12Abdominal Transplant Surgery, Department of \nSurgery, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium. 13Laboratory of Abdominal Transplantation, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium. 14Department of \nRadiology, King’s College Hospital, London, UK. 15Centre for Evidence in Transplantation, Clinical Effectiveness Unit, Royal College of Surgeons of England, London, UK. 16Department of General, \nVisceral and Transplantation Surgery, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany. 17Department of Radiology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, Birmingham, UK. 18OrganOx Limited, Oxford, \nUK. 19Department of Radiology, Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, UK. 20National Institute of Health Research (NIHR), Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre, Cambridge, UK. *e-mail: david.\nnasralla@nds.ox.ac.uk; constantin.coussios@eng.ox.ac.uk; peter.friend@nds.ox.ac.uk\n50 | NA T U RE | VO L 557 | 3 MAY 2018\n© 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

This was used as the precursor to the pres\ufffeent study which, to our knowledge, is the first randomized controlled \ntrial to test the efficacy of machine perfusion against conventional cold \nstorage in liver transplantation.\nLivers from adult DBD or DCD donors were eligible for enrolment. \nAdult patients awaiting a liver-only transplant, excluding those with \nfulminant liver failure, were eligible. If a suitable liver was allocated \nto a consented recipient, the liver was randomized to either conven\ufffetional SCS or NMP. In the SCS arm, the organ retrieval, storage and \nthe transplant were conducted according to standard practice. In the \nNMP arm, following removal from the donor, the liver was attached to \nthe OrganOx metra NMP device, where it was perfused throughout the \nduration of preservation (Fig.\xa01), until the transplanting surgeon was \nready to implant it, at which point it was removed from the device. The \nremainder of the recipient’s care followed standard practice.\nDaily during the first postoperative week, and at day 10, day 30, \nmonth 6 and month 12, biochemical results were recorded as well as \ngraft and patient survival data. At six months, a magnetic resonance \nimaging scan of the biliary tree (MRCP) was performed to assess evi\ufffedence of biliary injury. Biological samples were collected and stored in \na biobank from each liver and recipient enrolled in the study, for use \nin further mechanistic studies.\nThe primary endpoint was defined as the difference between the two \ntreatment arms in the peak level of serum aspartate transaminase (AST) \nwithin seven days after transplant. This hepatocellular enzyme is a clini\ufffecally accepted biomarker, predictive of graft and patient survival12.\nRecruitment\nBetween 26 June 2014 and 8 March 2016, 334 livers were randomized, \nwith 64 livers subsequently excluded (Fig.\xa02). Following organ retrieval, \na markedly different discard rate between the two trial arms resulted in \n100 SCS and 120 NMP livers available for primary outcome reporting, \nwith 101 SCS and 121 NMP livers available for secondary outcome anal\ufffeysis. This discrepancy in group size reduced the study power to 89.7%.\nOne NMP liver was cold stored due to an accessory left hepatic artery \narising from the aorta preventing effective cannulation. Eight NMP \nlivers received machine perfusion for less than four hours (for logistic \nrather than technical reasons). All of these organs are included in the \nNMP arm as part of the modified intention to treat analysis. For the \nper protocol sensitivity analysis, the eight livers perfused for less than \nfour hours were excluded and the single NMP liver that was preserved \nusing SCS was reassigned to the SCS group.\nDonor, preservation and recipient characteristics\nNMP and SCS donor and recipient groups were well-matched (Tables\xa01, 2). \nThe discard rate was higher in the SCS arm (24.1%; 32 out of 133) \nthan the NMP arm (11.7%; 16 out of 137; Extended Data Table\xa01). \nThis difference was statistically significant (−12.4%, 95% confidence \ninterval −21.4 to −3.3%; P=0.008). One NMP discard was the result \nof a device malfunction in an already marginal organ (hepatic artery \nhypoperfusion due to pinch valve miscalibration; see\xa0Supplementary \nInformation).\nFunctional warm ischaemia time applies only to DCD livers and was \nmeasured as the time from the onset of donor hypoxia (oxygen satu\uffferation<70%) or hypoperfusion (systolic blood pressure<50mmHg) \nuntil the start of cold aortic perfusion in the donor. The median \nfunctional warm ischaemia time was longer for NMP than SCS livers \n(21min versus 16min; P=0.003).\nTotal preservation time was measured from the start of cold aortic \nperfusion in the donor until graft reperfusion in the recipient. The \nmedian total preservation time was longer for NMP than SCS liv\ufffeers (11 h 54 min versus 7 h 45 min; P < 0.001). Within the NMP \narm, there was no significant difference in median perfusion time \nbetween DBD and DCD livers (9 h 55 min DBD versus 8 h 45 min \nDCD; P=0.449).\nPost-reperfusion haemodynamics were documented in 218 cases: \npost-reperfusion syndrome was more common in the SCS (32 out of \n97) than the NMP group (15 out of 121), a statistically significant dif\ufffeference (–20.6%, 95% confidence interval –31.6 to –9.5%; P<0.001). \nThis was despite reduced requirement for vasopressors in NMP livers \nin the post-reperfusion period (Extended Data Table\xa02a–c).\nIVC\nPV\nCBD\nGB\nHA\nFig. 1 | Image of liver during normothermic machine perfusion.\nThe hepatic artery (HA), portal vein (PV), inferior vena cava (IVC) and \ncommon bile duct (CBD) are all cannulated.

Unadjusted analysis (Student’s t-test) and sensitivity analysis \nundertaken in the per-protocol population confirmed these results.\nSubgroup analysis showed that the effect of NMP was different in \nthe two donor types (test for interaction P=0.012), although it was \nstatistically significant in both subgroups; the reduction in geometric \nmean peak AST was greater in DCD (73.3%, 95% confidence interval \n53.7–84.6%; P<0.001) than in DBD livers (40.2%, 95% confidence \ninterval 19.3–55.7%; P=0.001). Subgroup analyses for the model for \nend-stage liver disease (MELD) score and Eurotransplant-donor risk \nindex (ET-DRI) showed no statistically significant differences (data not \nshown). See Extended Data Table\xa03a, b and Extended Data Fig.\xa01 for \nfurther analysis. See Table\xa03 for full outcome results.\nEarly allograft dysfunction\nData to assess early allograft dysfunction (EAD) rates were available in \n216 recipients: the odds of developing EAD in the NMP arm (12 out of \n119) were 74% lower than the SCS arm (29 out of 97; odds ratio 0.263, \n95% confidence interval 0.126–0.550; P<0.001). A logistic regression \nmodel adjusted for donor type, MELD score and ET-DRI showed that \nthe adjusted odds of EAD in the NMP arm were approximately 72% \nlower than in the cold storage arm (adjusted odds ratio 0.276, 95% \nconfidence interval 0.124–0.611; P=0.002). The difference in EAD \nrates was partly a result of the difference in peak AST (described above), \nbut also a reflection of differences in bilirubin. The median bilirubin \nlevel in the first week postoperatively was lower in NMP recipients \n(2.25mgdl−1\n, 95% confidence interval 1.23–4.28)) than in the SCS \ngroup (2.87mgdl−1\n, 95% confidence interval 1.52–5.00; P=0.029).\nBiliary strictures on MRCP\nAn MRCP was performed on 155 (81 NMP, 74 SCS) of the 222 trans\ufffeplanted trial patients. There was no significant difference in the rate of \nnon-anastomotic strictures for DBD (NMP 7.4% (4 out of 54) versus SCS \n5.4% (3 out of 55); P=0.678) or DCD (NMP 11.1% (3 out of 27) versus \nSCS 26.3% (5 out of 19); P=0.180) livers. Only one patient in each trial \narm developed clinically relevant evidence of ischaemic cholangiopathy \nin the first year after transplant, both of whom were re-transplanted.\nTable 1 | Donor demographic details\nStratification factors for all \nrandomized livers NMP (n=170) SCS (n=164)\nDonor typea\nDBD 107 (62.9%) 104 (63.4%)\nDCD 63 (37.1%) 60 (36.6%)\nDonor demographics for all \nretrieved livers\nNMP (n=137) SCS (n=133)\nGendera\nFemale 54 (39.4%) 57 (42.9%)\nMale 81 (59.1%) 76 (57.1%)\nMissing 2 (1.5%) 0 (0.0%)\nAgeb 56 (45–67) (16–84) 56 (47–66) (20–86)\nEthnicitya\nAfrican–Caribbean 3 (2.2%) 1 (0.8%)\nCaucasian 131 (95.6%) 128 (96.2%)\nOther 1 (0.7%) 4 (3.0%)\nMissing 2 (1.5%) 0 (0.0%)\nCause of death\nCVA 74 (54.0%) 74 (55.6%)\nHypoxia 30 (21.9%) 32 (24.1%)\nTrauma 17 (12.4%) 16 (12.0%)\nOther 14 (10.2%) 11 (8.3%)\nMissing 2 (1.5%) 0 (0.0%)\nBody mass indexb 26.26 (23.66–30.52) \n(16.42–46.65)\n27.01 (23.74–30.56) \n(17.24–49.96)\nMissing 2 (1.5%) 0 (0.0%)\nET-Donor risk indexb 1.72 (1.47–2.09) \n(0.98–4.31)\n1.72 (1.50–2.10) \n(1.06–3.49)\nMissing 16 (11.7%) 19 (14.3%)\nCVA, cerebrovascular accident.\naFrequency and column percentages are reported.\nbMedian, interquartile range (IQR, first brackets) and full range (second brackets) are reported.\nTable 2 | Preservation and recipient demographic details\nPreservation details for all \ntransplanted livers NMP (n=121) SCS (n=101) P valuea\nFunctional warm ischaemia timeb\n(min) (applies to DCD livers; \nn=55 (34 NMP, 21 SCS))\n21 (17–25) \n(9–93)\n16 (10–20) \n(2–32)\n0.003\nCold ischaemia time prior to \nNMP (min)c\n (n=120)\n126 \n(106.5–143.0) \n(49–218)\nNA\nMachine perfusion time (min)c\n(n=120)\n547.5 \n(372.5–710.5) \n(85–1,388)\nNA\nTotal preservation time from \ncross-clamp in donor to organ \nreperfusion in recipient (min)\n714 (542–876) \n(258–1,527)\n465 \n(375–575) \n(223–967)\n0.0000\nSteatosis assessed \npre-preservationd,e\n0.366\nNone or mild 91 (75.3%) 89 (88.2%)\nModerate or severe 29 (24%) 12 (11.9%)\nMissing 1 (0.8%)\nRecipient demographics NMP (n=121) SCS (n=101) P valuea\nGenderd 0.717\nFemale 35 (28.9%) 27 (26.7%)\nMale 86 (71.1%) 74 (73.3%)\nDonor typed 0.209\nDBD 87 (71.9%) 80 (79.2%)\nDCD 34 (28.1%) 21 (20.8%)\nAgec 55 (48–62) \n(20–72)\n55 (48–62) \n(22–70)\n0.713\nCause of liver failured 0.782\nAlcoholic 36 (29.8%) 29 (28.7%)\nAuto-immune hepatitis 2 (1.7%) 5 (5.0%)\nHepatitis B 3 (2.5%) 2 (2.0%)\nHepatitis C 4 (3.3%) 4 (4.0%)\nHepatocellular carcinoma on \nbackground of cirrhosis\n15 (12.4%) 16 (15.8%)\nNon-alcoholic steato-hepatitis 11 (9.1%) 11 (10.9%)\nPrimary biliary cirrhosis 10 (8.3%) 3 (3.0%)\nPrimary sclerosis cholangitis 18 (14.9%) 13 (12.9%)\nOther 22 (18.1%) 18 (17.8%)\nBody mass indexc 26.18 \n(23.12–32.39) \n(18.02–50.99)\n26.94 \n(24.36–30.42) \n(18.91–42.95)\n0.626\nMissing 0 (0.0%) 1 (1.0%)\nRetransplantd 12 (9.9%) 8 (7.9%) 0.605\nMELD scorec\n (calculated at time \nof transplant)\n13 (10–18) \n(6–35)\n14 (9–18) \n(6–29)\n0.970\nUK 13 (10–17) \n(6–33)\n14 (9–18) \n(6–28)\nEssen, Germany 17 (14–19) \n(13–23)\n15.5 (14–17) \n(14–17)\nBarcelona, Spain 16 (8–26) \n(8–35)\n14 (9–16) \n(8–29)\nLeuven, Belgium 19 (13.5–25.0) \n(13–26)\n16 (16–20) \n(9–27)\neGFRc 87.36 \n(69.61–107.66) \n(33.45–156.43)\n92.22 (69.72–\n104.24) \n(30.19–\n155.04)\n0.928\nMissing 4 (3.3%) 3 (3.0%)\nET-Donor risk indexc 1.70 \n(1.47–2.07) \n(0.98–4.31)\n1.71 \n(1.50–2.01) \n(1.06–3.49)\n0.610\nMissing 13 (10.7%) 13 (12.9%)\nNA, not applicable. eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate.\naχ2 tests and non-parametric Mann–Whitney U-tests were used for categorical and continuous \nvariables, respectively.

Overall 10 recipients died \nduring follow-up, producing a one-year survival of 0.949 (95% confi\ufffedence interval 0.890–0.977) in the NMP group and 0.958 (95% confi\ufffedence interval 0.902–0.982) in the SCS group (P=0.901).

The measured haemo\ufffedynamic parameters were: hepatic artery flow (280±120mlmin−1\n) \nand portal vein flow (1.11 ± 0.2 l min−1\n). The measured meta\ufffebolic parameters were: pH (7.31±0.17) and lactate clearance\xa0from \n9.99±3.13mmol l\n−1\n at 15min NMP to 0.93±0.63mmol l\n−1\n by 4h \nNMP. The measured synthetic parameter consisted of bile production \n(9.17±11.16mlh−1\n). Notably, 18 transplanted NMP livers produced \nno/minimal bile during perfusion. All but one of these functioned \nafter transplant. There was no correlation\xa0between bile production and \npost-transplant liver function or later development of non-anastomotic \nbiliary strictures.\nOne NMP liver developed PNF. This liver was persistently acidotic \nwith lactate>4mmol for the duration of NMP. No other liver with \nthese characteristics was transplanted.\nFollowing transplant, 28 livers displayed minimal preservation \ninjury (MPI; peak AST<250 IU l−1\n) and 25 showed evidence of \nsevere preservation injury (SPI; peak AST>1,000 IU l−1\n). The donors \nin these groups were well-matched in all characteristics other than \nsex\xa0(Extended Data Table 4). During NMP, there was a difference in \nbaseline perfusate alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (MPI 171 IU l−1\nversus SPI 669 IU l−1\n; P=0.005) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) \n(MPI 1,073 IU l−1\n versus SPI 1,838 IU l−1\n; P=0.01) between the two \ngroups. Levels of these enzymes, as well as γ-glutamyltransferase (γGT), \nincreased more rapidly during the first 8h of NMP in the SPI group \n(ALT, an increase of 56 IU l−1\n versus an increase of 461 IU l−1\n, P<0.001; \nLDH, an increase of 483 IU l−1\n versus an increase of 980 IU l−1\n, \nP=0.06; γGT, an increase of 23 IU l−1\n versus increase of 104 IU l−1\n, \nP=0.004). MPI livers showed a reduction in measurable levels of \nhaemolysis (haemolysis index) as NMP progressed, in contrast to SPI \nlivers in which the levels of haemolysis rose (MPI, a decrease of 0.04 U \nversus SPI, an increase of 0.09 U; P=0.03). Bile production was greater \nin the MPI group (MPI 13.1mlh−1\n versus SPI 7.8mlh−1\n; P=0.03). \nLactate clearance was similar in each group. Post-reperfusion syndrome \nwas less common in the MPI group (MPI 0% (0 out of 28) versus SPI \n24% (6 out of 25); P=0.007). One NMP liver with perfusate transami\ufffenases in excess of 20,000 IU l−1\n was transplanted successfully.\nAdverse events\nThe proportion of patients for whom adverse events were reported \n(Extended Data Tables\xa05a–c, 6) was similar in the two arms (55.4% \nNMP, 95% confidence interval 46.1–64.4% versus 57.4% SCS, 95% \nconfidence interval, 47.2–67.2%) with a larger total number of events \nreported for SCS livers (128 NMP versus 164 SCS). Of these, a greater \nproportion of the serious adverse events (Clavien–Dindo grade ≥IIIb) \nwere in the SCS than NMP arm (16.4% NMP (21 out of 128) versus \n22% SCS (36 out of 164)). No statistical tests were applied to these data.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial to com\ufffepare any type of machine perfusion technology with conventional static \ncold storage in human liver transplantation.\nThe trial demonstrated significant reductions in peak AST and EAD \nrates in NMP livers; this is of clinical relevance as both are clinically \naccepted biomarkers for long-term graft and patient survival12,13. \nThese benefits are consistent with previous animal work10 and the \nphase-I clinical study9\n that preceded this trial, both of which showed \npost-transplant AST reductions in NMP livers. No differences were \nseen in graft or patient survival: a much larger trial is required to test \nthis outcome. It is notable that these reductions in peak AST and EAD \nrates were achieved in the context of improved organ utilization and \nlonger preservation times, both of which have implications in terms \nof addressing the donor shortage and logistical barriers that currently \nlimit liver transplants.\nDCD donors represent a largely untapped source of organs, com\ufffeprising 42% of UK deceased donors, but only 21% of transplanted \nlivers14. Utilization of DCD livers is limited by poorer outcomes (PNF \nand ischaemic cholangiopathy) compared with DBD livers. Allowing \nthe limitations of small group analyses, in this study NMP DCD liver \nprimary outcome data were superior to those of both DCD and DBD \nlivers preserved using SCS. In fact, the primary outcome of DCD NMP \nlivers was superior to that of DBD livers preserved by NMP: this was \npossibly owing to a selection bias, both of donors (lower threshold \nto decline DCD donors) and recipients (fitter patients selected for \nhigher-risk organs). The AST differences are in the context of longer \nfunctional warm ischaemia times, longer preservation times and fewer \norgan discards in the NMP arm, suggesting that NMP may be achieving \nthe desired objective of increasing organ utilization without compro\ufffemising outcome. If these findings were translated into clinical practice, \nthe increase in organ utilization would have substantial implications \nfor waiting list mortality, which is currently approximately one in five \npatients1\n.\nThe longer preservation times in the NMP group were not planned, \nbut were all within the maximum perfusion time defined in the pro\ufffetocol. There was no stipulation in the trial protocol that the preser\ufffevation times should be matched. As clinicians gained experience, it \nappeared that some centres had started to organize their operating \nschedule according to the preservation method, although no overall \ndifference between arms was seen in the proportion of transplants \noccurring in daylight hours. If, as appears to be the case, NMP can \nsafely extend preservation times without compromising outcomes, this \nwill have implications for operating department planning as well as \norgan utilization.\nThere were over 50% fewer discarded organs in the NMP group, \nresulting in 20% more transplanted livers (121 NMP versus 101 SCS). \nThe SCS discard rate of 23.7% was higher than the 17% reported in \nUK registry data14, and may reflect the high proportion of DCD livers \nenrolled in the trial; the discard rate of retrieved DCD livers in the UK \nis 30%14. This reported difference in organ utilization is likely to be an \nunderestimation of the full potential impact that NMP could have on \ntransplant numbers. The trial stipulated that only livers considered \ntransplantable according to standard practice could be enrolled. For \nthe full extent of improved organ utilization to be measured, livers \nwould need to be randomized to NMP or SCS before being offered for \ntransplant; this should form the basis of a future study. An increase of \n20% or more in the number of transplantable donor livers would have \na transformative effect on the mortality on liver transplant waiting lists \naround the world.\nThe haemodynamic characteristics of the NMP recipients following \nreperfusion were measurably superior to those of SCS recipients, in line \nwith previously reported findings15. This did not translate into a differ\ufffeence in ICU stay, hospital stay or need for renal replacement therapy \nbetween the two groups, despite previous reports showing a correlation \nbetween peak AST and renal replacement therapy16. The magnitude of \nthe reperfusion syndrome is a factor in determining the eligibility of the \nsickest patients for high-risk organs, due to the limited capacity of such \npatients to tolerate cardiovascular instability; NMP might therefore \nincrease the options for the most urgent patients.\nPerhaps the greatest limitation to more widespread utilization of \nDCD livers is the high rate of clinically important non-anastomotic \nbiliary strictures (NAS) which lead to a high rate of graft failure; this \nis believed to develop due to the vulnerability of the biliary tree to \nprolonged warm ischaemia. The rate of NAS in the NMP DCD group \n(11.1%) was lower than in SCS (26.3%) livers, despite longer functional \nwarm ischaemia times. This did not reach statistical significance, which \nmay be a function of sample size; the trial was not powered for this \noutcome. Reported rates of NAS in DCD transplants vary from 10 \nto 30%17,18, but these are in patients with symptoms suggesting bil\ufffeiary pathology, rather than those only apparent on imaging; biliary \n54 | NA T U RE | VO L 557 | 3 MAY 2018\n© 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Prior to this study, the radiolog\ufffeical incidence of both anastomotic and non-anastomotic strictures in \nasymptomatic patients was unknown; in particular, there is no real \nbenchmark against which to compare the rate of NAS seen in the DCD \nSCS group. Apart from the two patients retransplanted for ischaemic \ncholangiopathy, almost all of the remaining patients with radiological \nevidence of NAS had normal liver function at one year; this questions \nthe clinical relevance of a protocol MRCP at six months. The longer\ufffeterm follow-up of these patients will shed light on the importance of \na radiological diagnosis of biliary stricturing in patients with normal \ngraft function, and the role of MRCP as an endpoint in future trials.\nAs well as demonstrating improved graft preservation, this trial \ntested the feasibility, usability and safety of NMP, a vital component of \nthe evaluation of any new technology. It showed that the logistical chal\ufffelenges of NMP can be met successfully within clinical practice. Over \n120 NMP livers were transplanted in seven transplant centres across \nfour European countries. Nonetheless, adoption of this technology \ninto clinical practice may necessitate changes in the organ retrieval \nprocess, particularly with respect to technical support and transport \narrangements. It remains to be seen whether NMP is required for the \nfull duration of an organ’s preservation or can equally well be applied \nafter a short period of SCS when the organ reaches the transplanting \ncentre—this would simplify the logistics but may not be suitable for \nthe most marginal organs19. A phase-II study to test this has recently \ncompleted enrolment in the UK (NCT03176433).\nFor this new technology to be supported by healthcare funders, a \nhealth–economic case is needed. The results of this study suggest that \nbenefits will accrue not only from improved early graft function and \ntransplantation logistics, but also from improved utilization. Secondary \neconomic benefits will accrue from logistic changes, enabling trans\ufffeplants to be moved predominantly into daytime operating, with reduc\ufffetion in staffing costs and likely improvements in outcome. More timely \nintervention will also bring economic benefits—earlier transplantation \nis associated with lower morbidity and cost.\nThe effects of NMP demonstrated in this study are unequivocal with \nrespect to the primary endpoint, implying a benefit in livers currently \nused for transplantation. However, the greatest benefit may be realized \nby applying this technology to livers outside current acceptance crite\uffferia, in order to transplant organs currently deemed untransplantable. \nAlgorithms to assess organ viability, based on data obtained during \nNMP, will be essential if this potential is to be realized10. This study \nsheds some light on which perfusion parameters may be used to assess \norgan quality: bile production, acid–base stability, lactate clearance, \nperfusate transaminase levels, falling measurable haemolysis—all \ncorrelate with the degree of preservation injury evident after trans\ufffeplant. However, all but one of the livers transplanted in the NMP group \nfunctioned postoperatively, including one NMP liver with perfusate \ntransaminases in excess of 20,000 IU l−1\n and 18 livers with minimal \nbile production. Data from much larger numbers of NMP transplants \n(typically from a registry) would be required to determine specific \nmarkers of viability.\nThe importance of bile production during NMP is unclear. \nPreliminary evidence from our group20 suggests that preservation \ninjury causes impaired hepatocellular uptake of bile salts. We have \nshown evidence of progressive accumulation of bile salts in the perfu\ufffesate of livers with high post-transplant transaminase levels; something \nthat also correlates with poor bile production during NMP. The extent \nand nature of the injury required to produce this effect is not clear but \ndoes appear to reflect organ quality rather than viability.\nHigh-risk organs (for example, those with steatosis) may benefit from \ntherapeutic interventions delivered during NMP: several groups are \nexploring potential strategies, including stem cell treatments, de-fatting \nagents and immunological modification of the organ. Future trials \nmay be needed to formally test the size of the effect of NMP on organ \nutilization; for this it will be necessary to randomize livers at the time \nof organ offering rather than the time of retrieval. Organ utilization, or \norgan utilization with 12-month graft survival (functional utilization) \nwould be a logical primary endpoint for a study of this sort.\nThis study describes the formal clinical evaluation of a novel tech\ufffenology in liver transplantation, and could herald the start of a new era \nof intervention during organ preservation. It represents a first, neces\ufffesary step in demonstrating that NMP is feasible, safe and effective in \nclinical practice; the fact that the study has definitively met its primary \nendpoint should now enable the exploration of the technology’s wider \npotential.\nOnline content\nAny Methods, including any statements of data availability and Nature Research \nreporting summaries, along with any additional references and Source Data files, \nare available in the online version of the paper at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-\n018-0047-9.\nReceived: 28 September 2017; Accepted: 8 March 2018; \nPublished online 18 April 2018.\n1.

This investigator-led, multinational, open-label, two-arm, paral\ufffelel randomized controlled trial included seven liver transplant centres from\xa0the \nUK (Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge; King’s College Hospital, London; \nQueen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham; Royal Free Hospital, London), Belgium \n(Universitaire Ziekenhuizen, Leuven), Spain (Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, \nBarcelona) and Germany (Universitatsklinikum, Essen), and was part of the \nEU-funded Consortium for Organ Preservation in Europe (COPE, http://www.\ncope-eu.org/). Approval was obtained from national research ethics commit\ufffetees and medical device regulatory bodies in each trial region, in particular the \nLondon–Dulwich National Research Ethics Committee (NREC) and the Medicines \nand Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK; the Federaal Agentschap \nvoor Geneesmiddelen en Gezondheidsproducten (FAGG) and the Commissie \nMedische Ethiek of Universitaire Ziekenhuizen, Leuven, Belgium; the Comité \nÉtico de Investigación Clínica of the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona; the Deutsche \nÄrztekammer and the ethics committee of University Hospital Essen, Germany. \nThe trial protocol was registered before recruitment (ISRCTN 39731134). All rel\ufffeevant ethical regulations relating to the conduct of this study were followed at \neach trial site. The trial is reported in accordance with the CONSORT statement21.\nNo major amendments were made to the trial design after the start of recruit\ufffement.\nEligibility and consent. Inclusion criteria for donors and recipients were deliber\ufffeately broad to represent the full spectrum of clinical practice. Whole livers from \nDBD and DCD (Maastricht category III22) donors at least 16 years of age were \neligible. Specific donor consent was not required for trial inclusion. No organs \nwere procured from prisoners. Recipients were eligible provided they were at least \n18 years old and listed for a liver-only transplant, excluding those with fulminant \nliver failure, owing to the poor prognosis of this group regardless of organ quality. \nPotential participants were consented while on the waiting list; consent was \naffirmed on the day of transplantation. The consent included the recording of \nanonymized data for trial purposes and the collection of biological samples for \nstorage in the trial biobank (see ‘Sample collection’). No patient identifiable data \nwere collected.\nRandomization. Once an eligible donor organ was allocated to a consented recip\ufffeient and the availability of the NMP device and team was confirmed, the liver \nwas randomized. All clinical decisions thereafter, including graft suitability and \nprocedure scheduling, were made independently of the trial team.\nUsing an online randomization tool, livers were assigned to NMP or SCS with \n1:1 allocation ratio as per a computer-generated randomization schedule, using \nvariable block size, stratified by transplant centre and donor type (DBD/DCD). \nThe unit of randomization was donor livers rather than recipients, but analysis is \nreported for the transplant recipients.\nStatic cold storage group. Livers randomized to SCS were retrieved, preserved, \ntransported and transplanted according to local standard practice.\nNormothermic machine perfusion group. The OrganOx metra normothermic \nliver perfusion device was used (Extended Data Fig.\xa05a), which enables automated \norgan preservation for up to 24h. Following randomization to NMP, the device and \naccompanying researcher were transported to the donor hospital. The device was \nset-up during the retrieval procedure, as has been previously described9\n. A sterile \ndisposable set was installed on to the device and primed with 500ml gelofusine \n(B. Braun Ltd) and three units of donor-matched packed red blood cells. Antibiotics \nwere given at the outset and heparin, insulin, prostacyclin, bile salts and fat-free \nparenteral nutrition were infused during the perfusion (Extended Data Fig.\xa05b).\nFollowing retrieval of the donor organ, and while still at the donor hospital, the \nliver back-table operation was performed23, followed by cannulation of the hepatic \nartery, portal vein, inferior vena cava and bile duct. The liver was connected to the \nNMP device and perfusion commenced (Fig.\xa01). During the early part of the per\ufffefusion sodium bicarbonate was added incrementally to achieve a physiological pH. \nThe OrganOx metra perfusion device incorporates online blood gas measurement \n(Terumo CD1-500) together with software-controlled algorithms to control PO2\nand PCO2\n (within physiological limits), temperature (37°C), mean arterial pressure \n(65–75mm Hg) and), inferior vena cava pressure (0–2mm Hg). Typical blood \nflows of 200–400mlmin−1\n (artery) and 1,000-1,200mlmin−1\n (portal vein) were \nobtained. Glucose was measured manually and the value entered into the device. \nIf glucose fell below 10mmoll\n−1\n this automatically triggered the infusion of a fat\ufffefree TPN mixture (Nutriflex Special, B. Braun Ltd) into the perfusate.\nNMP continued throughout the duration of transport and storage until the \ntransplanting team were ready to implant the liver. The minimum protocol-stipulated \nNMP duration was 4h, the time needed for ATP repletion in animal studies11. \nThe maximum allowed NMP duration was 24h in line with the experience in the \nphase-I study and the regulatory approval for the device9\n.\nSample collection. Tissue biopsies (donor liver and bile duct), recipient blood \nand urine were collected at pre-specified time points from every liver/transplanted \npatient in the study. In addition to these, samples of perfusate fluid and bile were \ncollected from every NMP liver. These were stored in a central biobank established \nby the COPE Consortium for use in ongoing mechanistic studies. Each sample was \nallocated a unique bar code, which the biobank coordinator was able to match to \na specific trial identification number. No patient identifiable data were associated \nwith each sample.\nStudy end points. The primary endpoint was defined as the difference between the \ntwo treatment arms in the peak level of serum AST within seven days after trans\ufffeplant. This is a clinically accepted biomarker, predictive of primary non-function \nas well as graft and patient survival12,24 and is also associated with histological \nevidence of moderate to severe perfusion injury25,26.\nA surrogate marker of graft survival was used in this trial for two reasons: (1) \nthe relatively high survival rates in liver transplantation (>90%) and (2) the mul\ufffetifactorial causes of graft loss. A trial based directly on graft or patient survival \nwould have had to be unfeasibly large.\nIn order to ensure consistency and to minimise the hypothetical AST ‘wash-out’ \neffect in the NMP-treated organs, the first post-transplantation value was measured \nbetween 12 and 24h after reperfusion.\nSecondary end points included: (1) organ discard rate (after retrieval); (2) \npost-reperfusion syndrome27:>30% drop in mean arterial pressure persisting \nfor>1min within five minutes of reperfusion; (3) primary non-function: irre\ufffeversible graft dysfunction, for non-technical and non-immunological causes, lead\ufffeing to death or emergency liver replacement during the first 10 days after liver \ntransplantation; (4) early allograft dysfunction13 as indicated by any one of the \nfollowing clinical indicators: (i) bilirubin>170 μmol l−1\n on day 7 after transplant; \n(ii) INR>1.6 on day 7 after transplant; (iii) peak-AST>2,000 IU l−1\n during the \nfirst 7 days; (4) length of hospital and ICU stays; (5) need for renal replacement \ntherapy; (6) evidence of cholangiopathy on MRCP at six months; (7) graft and \npatient survival at one year.\nFull details of all secondary outcomes are available in the trial protocol28.\nSix-month MRCP. An MRCP scan was performed six months (range \n5–7 months) after transplant to evaluate the biliary tree for features of cholangiopathy \nevident by biliary strictures. All scans were reviewed by two independent radio\ufffelogists blinded to the method of organ preservation with disparities adjudicated \nby a third radiologist. Owing to the lack of any existing grading system for biliary \nstrictures, a system was agreed to in advance by consensus among the radiolo\ufffegists to allow definitive categorization of the presence and site of strictures. The \nfindings were reported as follows: (1) normal biliary tree; (2) anastomotic stric\ufffeture (>70% of luminal diameter); (3) unequivocal evidence of non-anastomotic \nstricture anywhere in the biliary tree; (4) both anastomotic and non-anastomotic \nbiliary strictures.\nStatistical analysis. Previous data from Universitaetsklinikum Essen, Germany \n(A.Pau. & S.R.K., unpublished observations), demonstrated the geometric mean of \npeak AST to be 608.59 IU l−1\n in patients transplanted following SCS. The present \nstudy was powered to detect a (clinically relevant) 33% reduction in peak AST \nwith 90% power at a 5% significance level, requiring 220 transplanted livers (110 \nper arm).\nResults are reported as a modified intention-to-treat analysis. A per-protocol \nsensitivity analysis was also performed excluding livers that received machine per\ufffefusion outside the protocol specified range (4–24h) and comparing the groups \naccording to the treatment actually received. Livers randomized but not retrieved \nwere excluded from the analysis.\nPrimary outcome was analysed using ANOVA with adjustment for stratification \nfactors. The peak AST was calculated for each recipient with at least two values \navailable. Missing AST values were not imputed. Binary outcomes were assessed \nusing test for proportions or logistic regression to adjust for potential confounders \nand report odds ratios. Continuous outcomes were compared using a Student’s \nt-test, if normally distributed, or by Mann–Whitney U-test otherwise. Time-to\ufffeevent outcomes were analysed using Kaplan–Meier estimates and log-rank tests. \nOutcomes are reported with 95% confidence intervals and P values to three decimal \nplaces. P<0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.\nPre-specified subgroup analyses were performed for donor type (DCD versus \nDBD), donor risk index (ET-DRI) and MELD score using tests for interaction and \nreported using forest plots. Interaction methods were used to look for consistency \nof treatment effect across the different subgroups and reported using forest plots. \nThe study was not powered to detect differences in the subgroups; these results \nshould only be regarded as hypothesis-generating.\nAnalyses were conducted using Stata version 14.2 (StataCorp).\nNo formal interim analyses of end points were carried out. At regular intervals, \nan independent Data Monitoring Committee reviewed confidential reports cov\ufffeering recruitment, safety parameters and primary end point data.\nFull details of the statistical methodology are available in the\xa0Supplementary \nInformation.\nMachine perfusion parameters.

The trial protocol did not stipulate the manner in which these \nparameters should be interpreted.\nOnce trial recruitment was complete, an ad hoc analysis was performed in which \nNMP organs were categorized according to those which, following transplantation, \ndisplayed minimal preservation injury (MPI; peak AST<250 IU l−1\n) and those \nwith severe preservation injury (SPI; peak AST>1,000 IU l−1\n). Groups were com\ufffepared for differences in donor and recipient characteristics, perfusate biochemistry, \nbile production and evidence of post-reperfusion syndrome.\nAdverse events. Reporting of adverse events was in accordance with the European \nCommission MEDDEV guidelines29. Following trial completion, these were \nreviewed by two independent clinicians blinded to the treatment arm. Adverse \nevents with a Clavien-Dindo30 grading greater than IIIa were considered serious \nadverse events. Rates of adverse events are reported with 95% confidence intervals. \nNo statistical tests were applied to these data.\nFull details of the trial methodology are available in the clinical trial protocol28.\nReporting Summary.

Sample size\nDescribe how sample size was determined. Data from 416 liver transplant recipients from University Hospital Essen \ndemonstrated the geometric mean of peak AST to be 608.59 IU/L (the geometric \nmean is used as peak AST is non-normally distributed). 220 transplants (110 per \narm) would have 90% power at 5% significance level to detect a 33% reduction (to \n401.67 IU/L) in the geometric mean of peak AST. Thus the trial required a sample \nsize of 220 livers to be transplanted and reach the primary endpoint. \nOnce trial recruitment was complete, an ad hoc analysis was performed in which \nNMP organs were categorised according to those which, following transplant, \ndisplayed minimal preservation injury (MPI; peak AST <250 IU/litre; n=28) and \nthose with more severe preservation injury (SPI; peak AST >1000 IU/litre; n=25). \n2. Data exclusions\nDescribe any data exclusions. Inclusion criteria for donors and recipients were deliberately broad to represent \nthe full spectrum of clinical practice. Whole livers from brainstem death (DBD) and \ncirculatory death (DCD) donors aged at least 16 years were eligible. \nRecipients were eligible provided they were at least 18 years old and listed for a \nliver-only transplant, excluding those with fulminant liver failure, due to their poor \nprognosis regardless of organ quality. \n3. Replication\nDescribe whether the experimental findings were \nreliably reproduced.\nThis is the first phase 3 randomised controlled trial to compare any form of \nmachine perfusion technology with static cold storage in human liver \ntransplantation. This findings have broadly confirmed those demonstrated in small \nscale animal studies and in small retrospectively matched case series. \nThis was a clinical trial not involving experiments that need replication.\n4. Randomization\nDescribe how samples/organisms/participants were \nallocated into experimental groups.\nOnce an eligible donor organ was allocated to a consented recipient and the \navailability of the normothermic liver perfusion (NMP) team was confirmed, the \nliver was randomised. All clinical decisions thereafter, including graft suitability and \nprocedure scheduling, were made independently of the trial team. \nUsing an online randomisation tool, livers were assigned to NMP or static cold \nstorage with 1:1 allocation ratio as per a computer generated randomisation \nschedule using variable block size, stratified by transplant centre and donor type \n(DBD/DCD). The unit of randomisation was donor livers rather than recipients, but \nanalysis is reported for the transplant recipients.\n5. Blinding\nDescribe whether the investigators were blinded to \ngroup allocation during data collection and/or analysis.\nThis was an open label study. Due to the nature of the intervention (large machine \nperfusion device), it was not possible to blind investigators as to which arm the \nliver had been randomised. .\nNote: all studies involving animals and/or human research participants must disclose whether blinding and randomization were used.\n\n2nature research | life sciences reporting summary June 2017\n6.

The study involved livers from deceased donors aged at least 16 years, with families providing consent for organ donation. Recipients were eligible if they were at least 18 years old and listed for a liver-only transplant, excluding those with fulminant liver failure. Both arms of the study were well-matched in terms of donor and recipient characteristics, including donor type, age, sex, ethnicity, cause of death, BMI, eurotransplant donor risk index, and model of end-stage liver disease score. The study found that NMP significantly reduced the peak alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level during the first week after transplant compared to CCS, with a geometric mean ratio of 0.506 (95% confidence interval 0.388–0.659; P<0.001). The study confirms previous findings from animal studies and smaller retrospective case series, but it is still considered an open-label study since it was not possible to blind researchers to group allocation due to the large machine perfusion device used in NMP. The study also notes that the NMP device used in the study is now CE marked and commercially available through the manufacturer, OrganOx Ltd. However, there are no restrictions on the availability of other materials used in the study. The study follows the ARRIVE guidelines for reporting animal research and provides detailed descriptions of the research animals and cell lines used, as well as information on their validation and authentication. The study also reports the statistical parameters used in analyzing the data, including the exact sample sizes, statistical tests used, and confidence intervals. Finally, the study indicates that there are no restrictions on the availability of unique materials used in the study, except for the NMP device, which is only available through the manufacturer.",0.56,0.8604672481272203,FULL_PAPER

Contraindications for donation\nhave been revised in order to better meet the organ demand. The use of lower-quality\norgans and organs with greater preoperative damage, including those from donation after\ncardiac death (DCD), has become an established routine but increases the risk of graft\nmalfunction. This risk is further aggravated by ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI) in the\nprocess of transplantation. These circumstances demand a preservation technology that\nameliorates IRI and allows for assessment of viability and function prior to transplantation.\nOxygenated hypothermic and normothermic machine perfusion (MP) have emerged\nas valid novel modalities for advanced organ preservation and conditioning. Ex vivo\nprolonged lung preservation has resulted in successful transplantation of high-risk\ndonor lungs. Normothermic MP of hearts and livers has displayed safe (heart) and\nsuperior (liver) preservation in randomized controlled trials (RCT). Normothermic kidney\npreservation for 24 h was recently established. Early clinical outcomes beyond the market\nentry trials indicate bioenergetics reconditioning, improved preservation of structures\nsubject to IRI, and significant prolongation of the preservation time. The monitoring\nof perfusion parameters, the biochemical investigation of preservation fluids, and the\nassessment of tissue viability and bioenergetics function now offer a comprehensive\nassessment of organ quality and function ex situ. Gene and protein expression profiling,\ninvestigation of passenger leukocytes, and advanced imaging may further enhance the\nunderstanding of the condition of an organ during MP. In addition, MP offers a platform\nfor organ reconditioning and regeneration and hence catalyzes the clinical realization\nof tissue engineering. Organ modification may include immunological modification and\nthe generation of chimeric organs. While these ideas are not conceptually new, MP\nnow offers a platform for clinical realization. Defatting of steatotic livers, modulation\nof inflammation during preservation in lungs, vasodilatation of livers, and hepatitis C\nelimination have been successfully demonstrated in experimental and clinical trials.\nTargeted treatment of lesions and surgical treatment or graft modification have been\nattempted. In this review, we address the current state of MP and advanced organ\nmonitoring and speculate about logical future steps and how this evolution of a novel\ntechnology can result in a medial revolution.\nKeywords: transplantation, machine perfusion, marginal, graft, immunogenecity, immunomodulation,\nreconditioning, expanded criteria donor\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nINTRODUCTION\nThe velocity and significance of progress in transplantation\nstarted to decrease around the turn of the century. Up until\nthat point, the number of transplantations performed was\never-increasing, and the outcomes continued to improve. The\nclinical benefit to the patient from the immediate and effective\ntreatment of organ failure was defined by improved patient\nsurvival. Patient survival as an endpoint followed by graft survival\nas a surrogate and indicator of judicious organ attribution\nwere the framework of significant momentum that succeeded\nin making transplantation a standard of care. This success\nwas fueled, however, not only by the healthcare quality gain\nbut also by a flourishing industry producing high-quality and\nexpensive immunosuppressive medication—to be taken for life\nafter transplantation (1–3).\nThe honeymoon period came to an end when both donor\nrates and short-term results stagnated. The established endpoints\nfor clinical trials are difficult to improve in the short run\nafter transplantation, and the field was slow in anticipating\nand responding to the changing circumstances—specifically\nthe shortage of standard criteria donors (SCD). The field of\ntransplantation now finds itself in very difficult circumstances:\n90%+ patient and graft survival rates leave little room for\nimprovement but also little room for error. At the same\ntime, the conditions and circumstances in organ donation are\nradically changing, with increasing donor age and comorbidities\nand donation from non-heart-beating donors. In countries\nspearheading the evolution, donation after cardiac death (DCD)\nand extended criteria donor (ECD) organs make up more than\n50% of the organ pool. With the pressure to maintain and further\nimprove the excellent short- and long-term results, but working\nwith very different resources, the most prominent immediate\nchallenge is to better define and preserve, if not improve, organ\nquality in transplantation.\nAbbreviations: A2AR, Adenosine A2A receptor; AST, Aspartate\naminotransferase; ATP, Adenosine triphosphate; CIT, Cold ischemia time;\nCMV, Cytomegalovirus; CVA, Cerebrovascular accident; DAMP, Danger\ufffeassociated molecular pattern; DBD, Donation after brain death; DC, Dendritic\ncell; DCD, Donation after cardiac death; DGF, Delayed graft function;\nD-HOPE, Dual hypothermic oxygenated perfusion; DRI, Donor Risk Index;\nEAD, Early allograft dysfunction; ECD, Expanded criteria donor; ECMO,\nExtracorporal membrane oxygenation; EMS, Exsanguinous metabolic support;\nESP, Eurotransplant senior program; ET-1, Endothelin-1; EVLP, Ex vivo lung\nperfusion; FABP, Fatty Acid- Binding Protein 1; GFP, Green fluorescent protein;\nGST, Glutathione S-Tranferases; H-FABP, Heart-type fatty acid-binding protein;\nHOPE, Hypothermic oxygenated perfusion; HMP, Hypothermic machine\nperfusion; HMPO, Oxygenated hypothermic machine perfusion; IFNγ, Interferon\ngamma; IL-10, Interleukin-10; IRI, Ischemia-reperfusion injury; KDRI, Kidney\nDonor Risk Index; LDH, Lactate dehydrogenase; MP, Machine perfusion; MSC,\nMesenchymal stromal cells; NAG, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase; NMP,\nNormothermic machine perfusion; NK, Natural killer cell; NKT, Natural killer\nT cell; NRP, Normothermic regional perfusion; OCS, Transmedic Organ Care\nSystem; PDR, Pancreas Donor Risk Index; PGD3, Prostaglandin D3; PNF, Primary\nnon-function; PV, Pressure volume; RCT, Randomized controlled trial; ROS,\nReactive oxygen species; SCD, Standard criteria donor; SCS, Static cold storage;\nSOFT, Survival Outcomes Following Liver Transplantation score; SOP, Standard\noperating procedure; SOT, Solid organ transplantation; TNF-α, Tumor necrosis\nfactor α; UNOS, United Network for Organ Sharing; VEGF, Vascular endothelial\ngrowth factor; WIT, Warm ischemia time.\nWith this as a driving force, modalities to prolong and\nimprove preservation together with the tools to assess organ\nquality and function are emerging as the new frontier. Beyond\nserving an immediate medical need, the technologies evolving\nherald a more fundamental potential for change in healthcare:\nwith the extracorporeal long-term preservation and assessment\nof organs, the capability for human organ treatment and repair\narises. Hence, 20 years after transplantation advanced to become\na standard of care, the field has the potential to play a key role and\nadd a chapter to healthcare once again (4–10).\nIn this review, we aim to address the current state of the\nfield. A clarification of the terminology and the definitions\nof marginal organs, including an overview and comparison\nbetween the definitions for each organ, shall help to provide\na better picture of the actual status. Considering the changing\ncircumstances, the actual impacts of a condition on organ quality\nand function need to be addressed not only from the viewpoint\nof an empirical correlation. The individual parameters need to be\nfurther addressed for their reversibility and treatability. Building\non this concept, the various modalities of MP in their different\nstages of development and actual benefit require a critical\nreflection. While the assessment of organ quality and function\nduring extracorporeal perfusion is in its infancy, the growing\nbody of data may help to eventually develop a comprehensive\npicture of the quality of the components of organs as relevant to\ntransplantation and beyond. An important focus in this context\nis the assessment, definition, and relevance of the immune system\nof organs if isolated from the human body. Immunomodulation\nand immunomasking seem more realistic if attempted under\nthe conditions of an isolated and perfused organ. The vision\nof a realization and refinement of the repair, treatment, and\nmodification of organs is starting to trigger a boost in interest\nboth in academia and in industry.\nDEFINING “MARGINAL” ORGANS\nIn the light of organ shortage, critical reflection on the expansion\nof the donor pool is essential. The definition of organs that are\nmarginal for transplantation is often considered a well-defined\nentity. In reality, however, the definition is very different for each\norgan, and there is incongruence between the various definitions.\nIt is clear and well-justifiable that different organs are considered\nto be extended criteria organs going by different criteria, since the\nrelevance of one single factor may be very diverse. The assessment\nof the outcome after transplantation of extended criteria organs,\nhowever, needs to be seen and interpreted with reference to the\ndiverse definitions used throughout the years.\nECD Kidneys\nThe determination of ECD evolved from the term “marginal\ndonors,” and much of the literature focuses on criteria for living\ndonors. Since this is not the focus of this article, we will restrict\nthe research to deceased donors and deceased donor organs.\nIt is well-known that a number of factors may impact\nthe eventual outcome after transplantation. The definition of\ncadaveric kidney organs marginal for transplantation emerged\nfrom prioritization of and preference for factors that may outrank\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 2 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al.

In the deceased donor situation, the prior medical history\nis not completely known, and the exact determination of\nhypertension, for example, often remains incomplete regarding\ndetails such as manifestation, duration, or response to treatment.\nSome of the understanding of donor risk factors also stems from\nliving donors (12), where early definitions of marginal donors\nrelate to the risks for the recipient rather than the risk for the\ndonor, which was only assessed and understood much later.\nHence, the definition of marginal or ECD kidneys needs to be\nused with caution since the definitions used are building on a set\nof parameters that have not been formally established, validated,\nand re-validated.\nStill, compared to other organ systems in SOT, a comparatively\ngood definition of marginal or ECD has been established.\nNoteworthily, the term “marginal” should be avoided in favor of\nECD, as “marginal” may be considered pejorative by the patients\nwho receive them and also by the programs that transplant\nthem (13).\nThe ECD criteria most widely used in kidney transplantation\nare the OPTN-approved criteria, as described by Metzger et al.\n(13). They are shown in Table 1.\nA helpful tool that combines such parameters is the Kidney\nDonor Risk Index (KDRI), which was generated by weighting the\nfollowing factors into a single number in order to predict the risk\nof post-transplant graft failure: age, weight, height, race, history\nof hypertension, history of diabetes, cause of death, hepatitis C\nstatus, serum creatinine, and DCD. The association of KDRI\nwith the outcome in the Eurotransplant senior program (ESP)\nwas evaluated by Schamberger et al. (14). Kidney transplantation\nfrom Maastricht category-III donors after circulatory death\n(DCD), which introduces a higher risk of primary non-function\nand delayed graft function (DGF), has been added to ECD\ncriteria (15). Furthermore, kidneys from a donor with an acute\nkidney injury before organ procurement correspond to marginal\nquality (16). Importantly, kidneys from donors with a history\nof extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have not been\naddressed specifically but can be classified as marginal organs\nsince deteriorated microperfusion can be assumed (17–19).\nTABLE 2 | Common criteria defining “marginal” or “expanded criteria donor\n(ECD)” livers, as well as “ECD DCD” livers.\nDBD\nCardiac arrest (min) >15\nProlonged hypotensive periods <60 mmHg for >1 hr\nAge (yrs) >55\nBMI (kg/m2\n) >30\nHBV Positive\nHBC Positive\nBMI (kg/m2\n) 79 (100.0)\nMacrosteatosis (%) >30\nHypernatriemia (mEq/L) >155\nICU stay (days) ≥ 5 (mechanical ventilation)\nNosocomial infection Positive blood cultures or pneumonia\nSplit liver yes\nAST (U/L) >170\nALT (U/L) >140\nCIT (hrs) >12\nVasopressor drug requirement Dopamine dose >10 µg/kg/min or\nany doses of other amines)\nNon-heart-beating Yes\nDCD\nAge (yrs) >50\nBMI (kg/m2\n) >35\nFunctional WIT (min) >30\nMacrosteatosis (%) >30\nDCD, donation after cardiac death; DBD, donation after brain death; min, minutes; yrs,\nyears; hrs, hours; CIT, cold ischemia time; HBV, hepatitis B virus; HCV, hepatitis C\nvirus; BMI, body mass index; ICU, intensive care unit; AST, aspartate aminotransferase;\nALT, Alanin-aminotransferase.\nECD Livers\nIn liver transplantation, the term “marginal” does not refer to\na number of distinct internationally accepted criteria that could\ncharacterize a graft, and nor does “ECD.” Instead, both terms\nencompass a variety of factors that have been observed to limit\ngraft quality, but the impact of each of these factors remains\nto be defined. Therefore, several models for the assessment of\nthe sum of such risk factors have been introduced (20). In this\nregard, valuable predictive quality of patient and graft survival at\n3 months was achieved using the Survival Outcomes Following\nLiver Transplantation (SOFT) score (21). Death censored graft\nsurvival at 60 months follow-up was well-predicted by the Donor\nRisk Index (DRI; c-index 0.59) and Eurotransplant-DRI (c-index\n0.58) (20).\nTable 2 lists those criteria that overlap in the mentioned\nscoring systems and that are widely applied when defining\n“marginal” or “ECD” liver grafts (22, 23). Apart from clinical and\nmetric parameters, these include histological criteria, since liver\nbiopsies are considered helpful in order to evaluate the organ\nquality. Whereas, liver fibrosis has been reported to predict a\nhigh incidence of early graft failure (24), Liu et al. (25) suggested\na macrovesicular steatosis of 30 percent as a cutoff value for\nmarginal grafts.\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 3 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al.

Table 3 summarizes\nthe criteria that have been commonly used by various authors\n(27–30). In an attempt to bring such criteria into a clinically\nuseful context, Axelrod et al. (31) presented a Pancreas Donor\nRisk Index (PDR). The score builds a prediction model of graft\nsurvival on donor factors together with ischemia time and type\nof transplantation (31).\nECD Hearts\nDue to the imminent gap between the supply of donor hearts\nand the demand for transplantable organs, strategies have\nemerged to overcome this clinical dilemma. The numbers of left\nventricular assist devices as bridge-to-transplant therapy have\nsignificantly increased over the last decade. Simultaneously with\nthis trend, marginal or “extended criteria” hearts are routinely\nevaluated in order to increase the donor pool. While standardized\ncriteria have not been published by societies so far, there is a\ngeneral consensus when it comes to the definition of marginal\ndonor hearts. The literature on this topic is primarily driven\nby US data. A Meeting Report by the American Society on\nTransplantation on adult cardiac transplantation is still lacking\na unified formal definition.\nTABLE 5 | Common criteria defining standard criteria (SCD), therefore not ECD\nlung.\nAge (yrs) <55\nBMI mismatch donor/recipient (%) >20\nClear chest X-ray Yes\nPaO2 (mm Hg) >300 (FIO2 1.0,\nPEEP 5 mm Hg)\nHistory of smoking (pack yrs) <20\nAbsence of chest trauma Yes\nAbsence of microbiologic organisms endobronchial Yes\nAbsence of malignancy Yes\nAbsence of purulent secretions or signs of aspiration\nendobronchial\nYes\nNegative virology Yes\nyrs, years; BMI, body mass index; FIO2, fraction of inspired oxygen; PaO2, partial pressure\nof oxygen; PEEP, positive end-expiratory pressure.\nBased on the current literature, the factors that should be\nconsidered as extended criteria in heart donation are given in\nTable 4.\nIn order to facilitate a better risk-assessment of allografts,\ndonor profiles have been implemented in Risk Scores. Smits et al.\nhave identified 12 variables associated with donor non-use in\nthe Eurotransplant region and have generated the Eurotransplant\nHeart Donor Score (32). Based on the UNOS database, a risk\nscore model (UNOS Donor Risk Score) has been developed by\nWeiss et al. (33).\nECD Lungs\nBased on the standard criteria donor lung definitions published\nin 2003 by Orens et al. (34), one can define an ECD lung if\nthe donor does not fulfill at least one criterion of the SCD\ncriteria suggested by the International Society for Heart and Lung\nTransplantation (Table 5).\nMACHINE PERFUSION\nThe concept of MP was part of organ preservation long before\nsolid organ transplantation (SOT) started to become a clinical\nreality and routine. With the publication by Collins et al., in\nwhich the authors described a method for the transportation of\nkidneys on ice using a preservation solution with the result that\nthe organs could be shipped in a small box and showed almost\nno damage after 30 h, the era of static cold storage (SCS) had\nbegun (35). The implementation of SCS led to satisfactory results\nwithin the entire field of SOT. However, with the increasing\nuse of organs procured from ECD and DCD, SCS alone is not\nable to deliver the post-transplant results we aim to achieve for\nour patients. The lack of oxygen, the continuation of anaerobic\nmetabolism leading to organ-damage and recipient-harming\nIRI after reperfusion, is significantly pronounced and more\ndetrimental in these marginal donor organs (36).\nFigure 1 illustrates the different possibilities for combining\nall preservation techniques available today clinically for almost\nall organs: static cold storage (as the golden standard,\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 4 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nFIGURE 1 | The past, present, and potential (near) future of organ preservation. Whereas, static cold storage (SCS) has been successfully applied over decades with\ngood outcomes in standard criteria donor (SCD) organs, at present, marginal or expanded criteria donor (ECD) organs in particular are increasingly preserved by\nhypothermic (HMP) or normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) technologies. After initial cold perfusion [*and optimally following normothermic regional perfusion\n(NRP) in Donation after cardiac death (DCD) organs], machine perfusion is commenced either at the retrieval center or at the transplant center in a “back to hub”\napproach. The next step is to effectively use the prolonged preservation times of ECD grafts achieved by optimized machine perfusion protocols to characterize ECD\norgan quality and transplantability via the assessment of biomarkers. To improve graft quality, NMP provides an ideal platform for future immunomodulatory\nmodifications and organ repair.\nso far), hypothermic preservation with/without oxygen, and\nnormothermic perfusion. Normothermic regional perfusion\n(NRP) is mentioned in Figure 1, as it has become an important\ntool for use before the procurement process of DCD starts. The\nfollowing sections will not present NRP data in particular, as the\nreview is about machine preservation in marginal donor organs.\nHowever, good and satisfying results after kidney, pancreas,\nheart, and liver transplantation were reported by several groups\nin the United Kingdom, Spain, and France and have been\nsummarized by previous reviews (37–42).\nRecently, Ruiz et al. presented a series of 46 livers transplanted\nafter NRP and concluded that their results, including 23%\nearly allograft dysfunction, are superior to standard DCD organ\nprocurements and comparable to donation after brain death\n(DBD) results (43). The Cambridge group (United Kingdom),\nclear NRP proponents, commented on this publication in a way\nsimilar to our suggestions illustrated in Figure 1. The publication\nby Ruiz et al. (43), like many others before it, did not compare the\nresults to an adequate prospectively organized control group.\nIt is noteworthy that, only recently, a protocol for NRP\nwas established even for DCD heart transplantation. Due to a\nrestoration of function of the arrested heart, organ assessment via\nechocardiography, pressure-volume loops, and cardiac-output\nmeasurements could be implemented (44).\nAccepted criteria for subsequent heart transplantation after\nweaning from mechanical support are defined as: cardiac\nindex >2.5 L/min/m2\n; central venous pressure < 12 mm Hg;\npulmonary capillary wedge pressure < 12 mm Hg; left ventricular\nejection fraction > 50% in transoesophageal echocardiography.\nNRP leads to a meaningful increment of survival benefits and\nhelps to enlarge the available donor pool by utilizing marginal\ndonor organs in a safe way (45, 46). Future trials are needed to\ncompare DCD organ transplantation +/– NRP followed by +/–\na combination of preservation techniques (42, 45).\nSince 2009, dynamic cold storage—hypothermic machine\nperfusion (HMP)—has progressed to become clinical routine in\nseveral fields of SOT—above all, in kidney preservation. Moers\net al. published their landmark paper in the New England Journal\nof Medicine and demonstrated a significantly lowered DGF\nrate in recipients receiving a hypothermically perfused kidney\ncompared to a renal graft stored on ice in the common way\n(47). Applying the same technology (HMP without supplemental\noxygenation), numerous publications on DCD and ECD kidneys\nhave followed over the past 10 years, showing similar results:\nECD and DCD kidneys and their recipients clearly benefit from\nMP as long as the duration of cold ischemia time (CIT) is\nreasonable (48–52). During the second half of the recent decade,\noxygen as a supplement has been focused on for kidney HMP.\nIn 2016, Jochmans et al. published an overview of ongoing\nMP trials in kidney and liver transplantation, including those\nassessing oxygenated HMP (53). One of these trials run by the\nCOPE\nR\nconsortium (http://cope-eu.com/work%20programme/\ntrials.html) has finished recruiting, and 1-year-follow-up results\nwere presented during the American Transplant Congress 2019.\nThis international RCT on oxygenated HMP of DCD kidneys\nincluded 197 kidney pairs, of which 106 were successfully\nhypothermically perfused and transplanted. Approximately 80%\nof the transplanted kidney pairs were eligible for the primary\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 5 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nanalysis and resulted in a similar eGFR at 1 year after transplant\nfor oxygenated (HMPO) and standard HMP. Analysis of all\ufffecause graft failure, however, showed a higher eGFR in HMPO\nthan in HMP. Overall graft loss was significantly lower in HMPO,\nleading the authors to suggest that HMPO improves 1-year\nkidney graft function when accounting for the beneficial effect\non allograft survival.\nIn contrast, in the field of pancreas transplantation,\ndynamic preservation technologies have not yet experienced\na breakthrough. Neither hypothermic nor NMP technologies\nare well-established, and SCS remains the standard procedure.\nA recent review outlined nine studies on HMP and 10 studies\non NMP. All of them were experimental; none of the human\npancreatic grafts were transplanted. However, the common\nconclusion of all of the published articles considered was that\nIRI, thrombosis, and morbidity after whole organ pancreas\ntransplantation might be reduced by both technologies (54–56).\nLiver transplantation can be regarded as the field in SOT that\nprimarily focuses on the development of preservation techniques,\ncurrently. The most commonly used perfusion types in the\ndaily routine are HOPE (hypothermic oxygenated perfusion),\nD-HOPE (d for dual oxygenation via hepatic artery and portal\nvein), and normothermic liver preservation. HOPE and D\ufffeHOPE studies have produced promising results, showing higher\nadenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels during preservation, less\nIRI, excellent graft survival after DCD liver transplantation,\nand a significantly reduced rate of bile duct injuries (57–60).\nThe Birmingham group was the first to publish its experiences\non livers undergoing HOPE and NMP consecutively (61).\nAlthough such livers were not transplanted, HOPE/NMP livers\ndeveloped less oxidative injury and inflammation and achieved\nenhanced metabolic recovery compared to livers undergoing\nNMP only (61). Liver NMP had its great appearance when the\nfirst prospective international multicenter RCT was published in\nApril 2018 (62). The trial on DBD and DCD livers with NMP\ndurations up to 24 h could show a significantly lower level of graft\ninjury, measured by reduced peak aspartate aminotransferase\n(AST), longer preservation times, and a 50% lower discard rate of\norgans compared to SCS. Bile duct complications and graft and\npatient survival were comparable in both groups (62).\nNMP has been shown to be beneficial in terms of immediate\ngraft function in all organ types in which it has been explored\nclinically: this includes the kidney (63–65), liver (62, 66), and\nthe lung (67, 68). The mechanism by which this occurs has not\nyet been conclusively proven, but the concept is that reperfusion\n(rewarming and oxygen delivery) in the artificial context of the\nperfusion circuit is beneficial by allowing recovery of cellular\nenergetics in the absence of the effector mechanisms needed for\nan acute inflammatory response (as in ischemia-reperfusion).\nORGAN PRESERVATION VS. ORGAN\nCONDITIONING VS. ORGAN REPAIR\nWith a new technology, the accompanying terminology is often\nsomewhat unspecific and unprecise in the beginning. This also\napplies to MP. It is paramount, however, to eventually clarify the\nterminology and define a uniformity for its correct use. Simply\nput, no other terminology than organ preservation would be\njustified at this point in the clinical application, since no targeted\nmeans for organ reconditioning (let alone repair) have been\nestablished. While this remains a glorious goal for the future,\nit also represents a significant legal and ethical challenge, since\nthe framework for the treatment of human organs remains to\nbe established. It remains entirely unclear whether extracorporal\norgan reconditioning and/or repair can be achieved. The hope\nand the hype are building on a growing body of experimental\ndata that indicates the feasibility of success or organ-specific\ntreatment. While this remains a most significant opportunity for\nthe field, we herein aim to adequately define organ preservation,\norgan (re-)conditioning, and organ treatment.\nOrgan Preservation—A Definition\nIt is interesting to note that no entry exists on organ preservation\nin Wikipedia (search, 21.08.2019), while a PubMed search\nyields 17189 entries (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?\nterm=organ+preservation). It seems to be a term where the\ndefinition appears so clear and easy that it does not need to\nbe written down. Yet again, a uniform description of organ\npreservation is not straightforward since it is not necessarily\ndefined by organ retrieval, temperature, metabolic state, or any\nother sole condition. The one possible common ground for a\ndefinition is the purpose. Putting an organ into a state that\nallows later reactivation and restitution of its original function\nwith the aim of minimizing damage during the period of mal\ufffeand non-perfusion.\nOne essential limiting factor in the determination of the\nquality of the preservation method is the poor definition of\nendpoint for a clinical readout. Primary non-function (PNF)\nseems relatively well-defined at first glance, but the actual\ndefinitions leave room for interpretation. PNF does not indicate\nno organ function at all but rather a function insufficient to\nprevent/avoid longer-term organ replacement therapy.\nFor example, in liver transplantation, according to Ploeg\net al., PNF is defined by poor initial function, requiring re\ufffetransplantation or leading to death within 7 days after the\nprimary procedure without any identifiable cause of graft failure\n(69). Such parameters inevitably introduce non-specificity into\nthe definition. The call for the need for re-transplantation and\nthe risk for death are clinician’s calls built on medical facts, the\ninterpretation of the physician, and a projection based on the\nparameters and the experience of the doctor. Since alternatives\nare insufficiently well-established, studies relating preservation\nquality to PNF need to be read in the light of this limitation.\nWhile PNF is seen as a suitable measure for organ preservation,\nother factors impacting on the PNF rate need to be considered.\nThe fact that re-transplantation is a risk factor for PNF indicates\nthat the role of recipient factors may be underestimated (70).\nFurther to this, no clinical preservation trial can seriously build\non PNF as an endpoint, since the PNF rates reported more\nrecently are in the range of 2–5%. Primary poor function is even\nmore vague in its sufficiency as a definition and clinical endpoint.\nVery recently, Dutkowski et al. (71) critically reflected on the\ncurrent parameters used to determine the success of preservation\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 6 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nin liver transplantation trials. While the current practice might be\nreasonable in the sense that it is building on the combination of\nparameters currently best established, alternatives are needed but\nneed to be more formally established prior to considering them\nnew clinical standards.\nA Brief History\nThe original vision of organ preservation as formulated in 1813\nwas built on the continuation of circulation and blood supply\n(72). The substitution of blood with perfusion solutions led to\nprolonged successful preservation of tissues, as described by\nCarrell (73). While prolonged successful preservation of tissues\nseems plausible according to these early findings, the actual\nsuitability for transplantation remained to be established (72).\nSuccessful kidney preservation for 3 to 5 days was achieved by\nthe use of continuous perfusion with cooled, oxygenated blood\nor plasma (74). Since continuous warm perfusion, oxygenation,\nand nutrition of an organ during transportation was technically\nvery demanding, the alternative concept eventually surpassed MP\nin the 1960s. The chemical composition of advanced solutions\nfor hypothermic organ storage resulted in excellent short-term\npreservation with good outcomes after transplantation. As with\nany achievement, the good results are a blessing and a curse.\nWith patient and graft survival as the only hard endpoints for\nclinical trials, the room for improvement became very small—\nat least with standard criteria organs. The search for superior\ntechnologies found a platform for clinical realization only when\nthe results after transplantation became less convincing, with a\ngreater effect on bile ducts as a target for early damage in liver\ntransplantation (72, 75–77). The organ shortage, together with\nthe push to use lower-quality organs and organs with additional\ndamage as a result of DCD, triggered the clinical realization of\nMP in liver transplantation.\nCurrent Situation\nThe current status of organ preservation remains largely defined\nby SCS. The well-established and standardized procedures of\norgan storage in three sterile plastic bags filled with preservation\nsolution (bag 1) or saline/ringer lactate/other (bags 2/3) is well\ufffeestablished, with a relatively good understanding of the risk\naccumulating with the duration of preservation. The major\nadvantage of SCS is the safety of the procedure. Pretty much\nnothing can happen to an organ in plastic bags, on ice, in\na plastic container. The major limitations of this technique\nrelate to the fact that metabolism continues—even though\nat a very low rate—eventually resulting in the accumulation\nof succinate and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (78–81). The\nimmediate exposure to normothermia and oxygen results in an\ninflammatory response and organ-specific damage early after\ntransplantation. The mechanisms responsible for the eventual\norgan damage not only in organ transplantation but also in\nother diseases such as cardiac infarction and stroke are well\ufffeestablished but not are the focus of this review. The key question\nin the consideration of NMP as an alternative to SCS is how\neffectively the mechanisms leading to an IRI are interrupted\nthrough either immediate NMP or NMP following SCS. While\npreclinical evidence (81) and the phase II/III trial by Nasralla et al.\n(62) have delivered evidence suggesting that NMP is superior to\nSCS when applied immediately, the actual net benefit of NMP\nfollowing SCS remains to be more clearly established. While\na key elements in such assessments are the proper definition\nof and agreement in the community on suitable endpoints\nregarding the preservation quality, the accompanying benefits\nand alternative endpoints should not be overlooked. The major\nbenefit of NMP vs. SCS is the time gained with (as it appears)\na relatively safe prolongation of preservation times under close\nto physiological conditions. The ability to monitor the viability\nand function of the organ adds important parameters for decision\nmaking and significantly ameliorates the logistical challenges\nin transplantation. The benefit of transforming transplantations\ninto scheduled procedures has the potential to significantly\nenhance safety but also training and teaching in transplantation.\nOrgan Reconditioning\nThe term organ reconditioning is used in a rather unspecific\nmanner in our field. According to Wikipedia, reconditioning\nmeans “to restore to a functional state, or to a condition\nresembling the original” (search “reconditioning,” September\n2019). The way this can be read in reference to human organs\nis that no intervention aiming beyond the restoration of the\ncondition of an organ prior to retrieval (a) or beyond the optimal\n(naïve) condition of a healthy human organ (b)—depending\non how the term “original” is interpreted in this context—shall\nbe included. These two possible views already point toward\nvery different states of an organ. The way the term was used\nin the recent scientific transplant literature is in agreement\nwith repair of the immediate injury prior to and during organ\nretrieval and storage. The key element of reconditioning/repair\nas clinically applied at this point relates to the prevention of an\neventual ROS burst by mitochondria and subsequent disruption\nof ATP production, mitochondrial permeability transition pores,\nand danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) release upon\nreperfusion. An electron shift toward succinate and subsequent\nreverse electron transfer upon reperfusion is discussed as a\nmechanism of damage and target of therapy in liver HMP (82).\nNMP is suggested to mitigate post-reperfusion hyperfibrinolysis\n(83) and inflammation (84). While these may be indirect effects\nof NMP, the actual immediate therapeutic mechanisms (if any)\nmay be glycogen repletion and ATP regeneration (85). Whether\nthese mechanisms are a simple effect of the restoration of close\nto physiological conditions or specific for NMP remains to be\nestablished. It is likely, however, that the benefit of NMP is\nmostly defined by the replacement or shortening of SCS and the\nindirect effects on logistics and preparation, organ monitoring,\nand decision making. Further to this, NMP may emerge as a\nplatform enabling organ treatment, while it may not have a\ntherapeutic/reconditioning effect per se.\nOrgan Repair\nHuman organ repair, apparently, is treated as an equivalent\nto organ regeneration (Google search “human organ repair,”\nSeptember 2019). While the common understanding of organ\nrepair might be more mechanistic and that of organ regeneration\nmore biological, the distinction between the terms seems vague.\nAlbeit experimental, therapeutic interventions in lungs seem\nmost closely approaching possible clinical implementation (86).\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 7 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nBronchoalveolar lavage, surfactant replacement, and alveolar\nrecruitment maneuvers seem to positively affect organ tissue\nmorphology and organ function. A hurdle to clinical application\nmay be the legislation. Directive 2004/23/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council “on setting standards of\nquality and safety for the donation, procurement, testing,\nprocessing, preservation, storage, and distribution of human\ntissues and cells” largely focusses on tissues and not organs\nbut represents an important reference. Since preservation times\ncan be prolonged with the technologies being developed and\nurgency may no longer serve as justification for immediate\nprocessing (transplantation) without quality assurance, the legal\nframework for tissues and cells could be applied to organs.\nThe second element of the legal consideration relates to the\nelement of organ therapy. Inevitably, the issues of responsibilities\nand possession require clarification for attempts to introduce\nex vivo human organ treatment into clinical application. As\nlong as an organ is labeled as discarded because it seems\nunsuitable for immediate transplantation, the organ will not\nbe allocated to an individual, and hence considerations of\npossession and responsibilities become less demanding. Once\norgans possibly suitable for immediate transplantation have been\ntreated for reasons such as quality improvement or possibly organ\nreconditioning, the allocation process may be completed and the\nfuture recipient indicated. If and how an individual can consent\nto interventions and/or a trial involving organs will eventually\nrequire clarification.\nDirective 2010/45/EU of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council of 7 July 2010 on standards of quality and safety\nof human organs intended for transplantation (https://eur-lex.\neuropa.eu/eli/dir/2010/53/oj) does not provide much guidance\nregarding this issue.\nMACHINE PERFUSION IN CLINICAL\nPRACTICE\nSCS is a simple, safe, and cheap method to preserve and transport\norgans, and it has been successfully applied over decades with\ngood outcomes in SCD organs. However, to date, the large\ndiscrepancy between patients on the waiting lists and available\ndonor organs has forced the transplant community to cope with\nthe demand by pushing the limits and expanding the donor\npool by accepting increasing numbers of marginal organs from\nECD and reestablish DCD programs (87). Importantly, ECD and\nDCD organs have been identified to be particularly prone to IRI.\nAlthough SCS can decelerate degradation of a preserved organ,\nespecially in high risk or marginal organs, limited applicability\nis the consequence (36, 78). Attempting to overcome this issue,\nseveral MP technologies have been developed and now find their\nway into clinical practice in SOT.\nHMP of the Liver\nLiver HMP has been translated from the experimental state to\nclinical reality over the last decade. In 2010, the first phase I\nprospective cohort study was published, reporting on 20 patients\nwho underwent liver transplantation of grafts preserved by non\ufffeoxygenated HMP. Outcomes were compared to a matched SCS\ncontrol group. HMP time ranged from 2 to 7 h, with a total\nCIT below 12 h. Except for a significantly lower peak serum\nAST in the HMP group, no further significant differences were\nobserved in regard to PNF, early allograft dysfunction, or graft\nand patient survival. However, clinical feasibility, as well as non\ufffeinferiority to SCS, was proven, making way for further studies\n(88). Five years thereafter, the same group showed promising\nresults by transplanting 31 ECD livers declined by the United\nNetwork for Organ Sharing (UNOS) region and preserved under\nhypothermic dynamic conditions at 4–8◦C. Compared to well\ufffematched SCS controls, significantly fewer biliary complications\nand shorter hospital stays were observed. This study represents a\nlandmark, since the effectiveness of MP was shown within the\nmost susceptible livers in the donor pool (89). The impact of\nHMP on marginal organs was further investigated by Dutkowski\net al. In an international matched-case analysis, 25 DCD livers\nwere subjected to HOPE and compared to matched SCS DCD\nlivers. HOPE resulted in a significant reduction of ischemic\ncholangiopathy (HOPE: 20% vs. SCS: 46%) as well as a significant\nimprovement of 1-year graft survival rates (90 vs. 69%) (58).\nThe beneficial effect of HMP on DCD grafts was confirmed by a\nprospective case-control liver transplantation study, comparing\n10 grafts with at least 2 h of DHOPE to 20 grafts without.\nAn 11-fold increase in cellular ATP during oxygenation was\ndocumented. In addition to good early graft function, both 6-\nmonth and 1-year graft survival were 100%, while 6-month graft\nsurvival and 1-year graft and patient survival in the control group\nwere 80, 67, and 85%, respectively (57). Moreover, the same\ngroup could demonstrate an attenuation of IRI-associated bile\nduct damage after transplantation of DCD end-ischemic DHOPE\nliver grafts (90).\nHOPE in particular has evolved to become a widely used\ntechnology, showing excellent longer-term results. Schlegel et al.\nprovided data on 5-year outcomes of patients receiving DCD\nlivers preserved with 1–2 h of end-ischemic HOPE (n = 50)\nand compared them to the equal numbers of DCD liver\ntransplants without HOPE or DBD liver transplantations. Five\ufffeyear outcomes of HOPE-treated DCD liver transplants were\nsimilar to those of DBD primary transplants and superior to those\nof untreated DCD liver transplants (HOPE DCD 94% vs. SCS\nDCD 78%) (91).\nNMP of the Liver\nPreserving an organ under physiological conditions is the ideal\ncondition to prevent deleterious effects of ischemia as well as\nIRI following SOT. Similar to HMP, NMP has recently been\nimplemented in clinical routine at a variety of centers. The\ntransfer from the experimental stage to clinical application\nwas first described by Ravikumar et al. in 2016. In this phase\n1 (first-in-man), non-randomized prospective trial, short-term\noutcomes of 20 recipients of NMP-perfused donor livers were\nmatched in a ratio of 1:2 to cold-stored livers. In the study group,\nlivers were preserved under normothermic conditions over the\nentire preservation period (ranging from 3.5 to 18.5 h). Except for\na significantly reduced peak serum AST in NMP-liver recipients,\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 8 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nno differences regarding short-term recipient survival, PNF rate,\nor early allograft dysfunction were observed. Therefore, the safety\nand feasibility of this dynamic preservation method could be\nconfirmed, opening the field for further clinical investigations\nwith major implications on logistics (66).\nFeasibility and reproducibility following transplantation were\nfurther underlined in a U.S. phase I non-randomized pilot study\n(92). However, this trial also pointed out that NMP of an organ\nis not a trivial procedure and runs the risk of graft loss if\nhuman/technical errors occur. Out of 10 procured livers, one\norgan had to be promptly discarded due to an unrecognized\nportal vein twist. The remaining nine organs (four DCD\nMaastricht class III, 5 DBD) were successfully transplanted, and\noutcomes were comparable to matched control liver transplant\nrecipients of SCS grafts. The proof of concept and feasibility gave\nway for larger-scale trials.\nNasralla et al. were first to perform RCT to test the efficacy\nof NMP vs. SCS. After informed consent had been obtained\nfrom the recipient, the allocated liver was either randomized to\nSCS or NMP. NMP was performed over the entire preservation\nperiod. Outcomes of 121 NMP-graft recipients were compared to\noutcomes from 101 well-matched SCS-graft recipients. The key\nfindings of this study were a significantly reduced peak serum\nAST, a significant reduction of post-reperfusion syndrome, and\na 72% lower adjusted odds rate of developing early allograft\ndysfunction (EAD) in the NMP liver recipients compared to\ncontrols. Furthermore, NMP of the liver graft resulted in\nincreased organ utilization with a 50% lower discard rate in this\ngroup (62).\nThe additional positive effect of NMP is the “almost”\nphysiological aspect of this method, which opens up new\npossibilities by means of organ assessment and organ selection.\nThis fact was a matter of investigation in an observational\nstudy, where livers considered unsuitable for transplantation\nas well as highest risk liver were included. In total, 47 livers\nwere biochemically assessed during the preservation, resulting\nin 39 liver transplants. Remarkably, two out of 19 livers deemed\nunsuitable were transplanted (93).\nIn summary, both HMP/HOPE and NMP are accepted\nand clinically established preservation methods, particularly\ninteresting in the preservation and preconditioning of high-risk\norgans. Especially in this organ category, including ECD and\nDCD livers, they have both been shown to be superior to SCS.\nWhether HMP/HOPE or HMP is superior to the other is still a\nmatter of debate since the two methods have not been correlated\nwith each other in clinical settings, and further RCTs are needed.\nHMP of the Kidney\nThe amount of clinical evidence for dynamic preservation of\nkidney grafts is rapidly increasing. Moers et al. were first to\nperform an international RCT on hypothermically perfused\nkidneys for transplantation. One kidney from 336 deceased\ndonors was randomly assigned to HMP, and the other to SCS. A\nreduced risk of DGF and improved graft survival in favor of MP\ufffepreserved organs was shown (47). These promising results were\nconfirmed in a subsequent RCT from the Eurotransplant region.\nJochmans et al. investigated the efficacy of HMP in preserving\nDCD kidneys. Similar to Moers et al., DCD kidneys were assigned\nin a 1:1 match to HMP or SCS, resulting in a total of 164 kidney\ntransplants (82 HMP vs. 82 SCS). HMP resulted in a significantly\nreduced DGF rate as well as better early graft function after\n1 month compared to SCS. However, 1-year graft survival was\ncomparable in both groups (49).\nFurthermore, in another RCT, kidneys were either preserved\nby HMP or SCS. In accordance with Moers as well as\nJochmans, the primary end-point was the occurrence of DGF.\nSecondary endpoints were primary non-function as well as graft\nsurvival. Both the risk of DGF and the incidence of non\ufffefunction were significantly reduced by HMP in their cohort.\nOne-year graft survival and function could be improved by\ndynamic cold graft preservation (52). Despite these findings,\nthe importance of different factors such as the impact of CIT\nand the combination of CIT with HMP have to be mentioned.\nCIT is a known independent risk factor for DGF. In order\nto investigate which kidney graft may further benefit from\nHMP prior to transplantation, Kox et al. analyzed prospectively\ncollected data from the “Machine Perfusion Trial.” A total of 752\nrenal transplants were included with 376 dynamically preserved\nkidneys and 376 statically preserved grafts. They identified CIT\nas an independent risk factor for DGF. Furthermore, HMP did\nnot prevent DGF if CIT exceeded 10 h (51).\nThe optimal timepoint for, as well as the optimal duration of,\nHMP is still a matter of debate. HMP can be used either as a\nprimary preservation method or in the end-ischemic phase as\na reconditioning tool. Matos et al. were able to show a faster\nrecovery of renal function if grafts were subjected to HMP prior\nto transplantation after a mean SCS period of 22 h. MP time was\nat least 6 h. However, this beneficial effect was limited to donors\nunder the age of 50, who represent a rather selective group (94).\nFurther studies followed, indicating a beneficial effect of MP in\nthe end-ischemic phase by displaying a reduction of DGF, as\nwell as an improved organ acceptance. This last positive trend is\nattributed mainly to the possibility of organ monitoring (95, 96).\nNMP of the Kidney\nNMP of the kidney may eventually resolve many issues\nrelated to damage induced by ischemic phases. The idea of\npreserving kidney grafts under almost physiological conditions\nwith the possibility of real-life assessment of the graft prior to\ntransplantation sounds intriguing. However, while the number\nof preclinical studies using animal models as well as discarded\nhuman kidneys is steadily increasing, evidence for NMP of\nthe kidney in a clinical setting is rather poor. Hosgood et al.\nwere first to transform preclinical experience into clinical reality\nby transplanting a 62-year-old ECD kidney into a 55-year old\nrecipient. After 11 h of SCS, the graft was perfused with a\nplasma-free red cell-based solution at 33.9◦C for 35 min prior\nto transplantation. Although a slow graft function was observed,\nthe patient remained dialysis free with a serum creatinine level\nof 132 µmol/L at 3 months post-transplantation. In contrast, the\nrecipient of the opposite kidney developed DGF (64). Based on\nthis first success, the Leicester group translated NMP into clinical\nreality on a larger scale. Eighteen ECD kidneys were subjected to\nNMP reconditioning prior to transplantation. The average NMP\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 9 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\ntime was prolonged to 63 min. Outcomes were compared to 47\nmatched ECD kidneys preserved by SCS. In this study, NMP\nresulted in a significantly reduced DGF rate compared to controls\n(NMP: 5.6% vs. SCS: 36.2%). However, no differences could be\nobserved in regard to 1-year graft or patient survival (97).\nTaken together, HMP of the kidney has been shown to have its\nplace, especially in the preservation of marginal grafts, including\ngrafts from DCD and ECD, with superior outcomes in the early\nphase compared to SCS. However, CIT is still the limiting factor\ninfluencing short- as well as long-term outcomes. In contrast,\nalthough the amount of preclinical data is rapidly increasing,\nNMP is still in its early phase. However, feasibility and non\ufffeinferiority to SCS have been described at this early stage, and\nmulticenter RCTs are planned.\nMachine Preservation of the Pancreas\nIn contrast to the dynamic preservation of liver and kidney,\npancreatic MP is challenging. This is attributed to the physiologic\nas well as the anatomical characteristics of the pancreatic graft\n(98). MP of pancreatic grafts poses major challenges due to the\nsusceptibility of the organ to IRI-associated alterations, including\nacinar necrosis, edema formation, and endothelial disruption.\nThese factors in particular are recognized risk factors for early\ngraft pancreatitis and thrombosis, eventually resulting in graft\nloss (98, 99).\nIn contrast to the liver as well as the kidney, the\npancreas is characterized by a low-flow and low-pressure\nenvironment, which impedes the direct translation of the existing\nperfusion machines for use in dynamic pancreas preservation\n(100). However, the feasibility of pancreatic HMP has been\ndemonstrated in several experimental settings involving the\npreservation of porcine, dog, and discarded human pancreas\ngrafts (55, 101, 102). Although results are promising in this\nexperimental setting, clinical translation is still pending.\nTherefore, assessment and evaluation of a pancreatic graft\nprior to transplantation would be of the utmost importance,\nsince changes in donor demographics result in an increased\nneed for the acceptance of higher-risk grafts at high-volume\ncenters. However, MP of pancreatic grafts must still be considered\nexperimental at this stage.\nMachine Preservation of the Lung\nDue to pre- and peri-retrieval management and direct\nexamination of the donor organ by the explant surgeon, some\nextended criteria organs can be directly used with acceptable risk\nfor the recipient, but a notable number are rejected during the\nretrieval process. There is still a lack of clear decision criteria\nfor lung suitability for transplantation or attempts at lung\nreconditioning using an ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) (103).\nNeedless to say, MP could improve organ availability, which is\ncritically needed in the face of a waitlist mortality that is reported\nto be up to 30% depending on the allocation system (104).\nImportantly, ex vivo prolonged lung preservation resulted in\nsuccessful transplantation of high-risk donor lungs (105), and\nMP is now indispensable for evaluating lung graft quality from\nan uncontrolled DCD (106). Very promising data have come\nfrom experimental EVLP studies, which are outlined later in\nthis article.\nMachine Preservation of the Heart\nAt present, SCS of donor hearts remains the standard practice\nin most transplant units, whereas MP is limited to a few centers\nin the US and Europe. To date, only one device is available for\nclinical use—the Transmedic Organ Care System (OCS) Heart.\nAt mild hypothermia (34◦C), the system uses a combination of\ndonor blood and a proprietary solution as perfusate for the heart.\nIn 2014, heart NMP has led to the first distant procurement DCD\nheart transplantation. To date, over 100 DCD heart transplants\nhave been performed using a cardiac perfusion system (107), and\nMP of hearts exhibited safe preservation in RCTs (108).\nEX VIVO MONITORING OF ORGAN\nFUNCTION AND QUALITY\nCurrently, the decision as to whether organs are suitable for\ntransplantation is determined on the basis of more or less\nsubjective empirically established clinical parameters that have\nbeen shown to be associated with an increased rate of early\nallograft dysfunction or graft failure. Parameters such as donor\npast medical history, last known laboratory values, findings\nduring procurement, and other procurement variables such as\nexpected ischemia times primarily determine the acceptability\nof a graft. These parameters include prolonged warm ischemia\ntime (WIT) >30 min during DCD, prolonged CIT, and\nparenchymal alterations within the graft (e.g., steatosis, fibrosis,\narteriosclerosis). Viability testing and functional assessment\nprior to transplantation are likely to extend the utilization of\nsuboptimal or marginal organs (109–111).\nHMP is an alternative method to standard SCS for the\npreservation of organs. For different types of kidney grafts, HMP\noffers superior preservation compared with SCS. In terms of graft\nquality assessment during HMP, some biochemical parameters of\nthe released perfusate and hydrodynamic parameters are found\nto independently correlate with the outcome—a finding that may\nhelp clinicians in their decision making.\nIncreased Glutathione S-Tranferase (GST), N-acetyl-beta-D\ufffeglucosaminidase (NAG), heart-type fatty acid-binding protein\n(H-FABP), or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations\nduring MP may serve as indicators for suboptimal graft quality.\nFurthermore, levels of redox-active iron measured in the\nperfusate have been correlated with DGF rates (112–114).\nMoreover, the measurement of vascular resistance during MP\nrepresents an additional and objective source of information\nthat can assist clinicians in their decision-making process.\nHigh vascular resistance as a hydrodynamic parameter has\nbeen shown to be associated with an increased risk of DGF\ndevelopment and predictive for 1-year graft failure (115–117).\nTaken together, to date, increased vascular resistance and high\ninjury marker concentrations in the perfusate are risk factors for\nDGF and helpful parameters, but they are not accurate enough\nto justify a decision for discard based on their interpretation\nalone (112–114, 117).\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 10 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nConcerning kidney NMP, a scoring system has been\ndeveloped by Hosgood and Nicholson. The decision on whether\nto transplant an NMP-kidney was based on macroscopic\nappearance, renal blood flow, and total urine output during\nNMP. The authors conclude that, currently, a high percentage of\nretrieved kidneys are being unnecessarily discarded (80, 118).\nCompared to the kidney, data on liver monitoring during\nHMP remain scarce, although recent publications suggest\npromising parameters. A correlation between the AST levels\nin the perfusate during HMP and the peak of AST after liver\ntransplantation has been described. Furthermore, during HMP\nof porcine livers, a cumulative release of Fatty Acid- Binding\nProtein 1 (FABP) or AST may be represented by a linear or\nlogarithmic equation, respectively. Each equation is characterized\nby a b-coefficient that is able to discriminate between livers likely\nto fail. Similarly, during HMP of human livers discarded for\ntransplantation, AST release in the perfusate could discriminate\nbetween livers suitable for transplantation and unsuitable ones.\nMore sophisticated methods to determine graft viability include\nevaluation of ATP content assessed by magnetic resonance\nimaging and spectroscopy (89, 91, 119–121). In this regard, van\nRijn et al. used cellular ATP content during oxygenated dual\n(arterial and portal perfusion) HMP as a viability marker for liver\ngrafts. Cellular ATP content correlated with biochemical function\nearly after transplantation (57).\nFurthermore, there is evidence that a decline in arterial flow\nin a pressure-controlled system of MP can be used as a marker\nfor decreasing graft viability. However, in general, it cannot be\nadvised to use flow values as an indicator of liver damage and\nviability during human liver MP (61, 91, 122).\nConcerning NMP of liver grafts, this technology has been\napplied with promising results for utilization and outcomes\n(62, 66, 92, 123–126), and the option for the assessment of\nliver viability during NMP has been highlighted. Imber et al.\n(127) suggested that bile production is directly associated with\nliver viability. Matton et al. (128) were able to show that a\nbiliary bicarbonate concentration greater than 18 mmol/L has a\nhigh negative predictive value in terms of histological bile duct\ninjury. Moreover, biliary pH greater than 7.48, biliary glucose\nconcentration less than 16 mmol/L, bile/perfusate glucose\nconcentration ratio less than 0.67, and biliary LDH concentration\nless than 3,689 U/L may serve as indicators for high biliary\nviability. Watson et al. (93) published their experience of\ntransplanting declined livers following NMP and graft viability\nassessment. They observed that NMP resulted in a reduced\nincidence of post-reperfusion syndrome and described biliary\npH as a predictive marker for post-transplant cholangiopathy.\nPerfusate lactate and transaminases and bile production during\nNMP were suggested by Op den Dries et al. (129) to serve\nas viability markers. Recently, Mergental et al. (130) published\nviability criteria (applicable within 3 h of perfusion) for livers\nconsidered suitable for transplantation. These include lactate\nclearance, bile production, PH- homeostasis, and stable pressure\nand flow dynamics of the graft.\nThere is growing evidence that hepatic ATP content may serve\nas a viability marker. In clinical studies, hepatic ATP levels prior\nto organ retrieval or during preservation correlated with primary\nliver function after transplantation. Bruisma et al. showed\nthat differences in mitochondrial respiration and restoration of\ncellular ATP contents are possible viability markers in the setting\nof NMP. Moreover, NMP offers the option to perform dynamic\nmetabolomic analyses in both bile samples and sequential liver\nbiopsies (111, 131).\nHowever, although these results seem impressive, none of the\nabove-mentioned viability markers have been validated in larger\nstudies, and the small numbers of patients included in the studies\nmake it difficult to draw robust conclusions.\nRegarding a potential viability assessment of human pancreas\ngrafts during HMP, flow indices and histological assessment\nof duodenal and pancreas-parenchyma biopsies throughout the\nperfusion duration have been proposed. Branchereau et al.\ndescribed an absence of edema, a decrease in resistance indices,\nand normal staining for insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin as\nmarkers for good graft quality (56, 101). Barlow et al. suggested\nthe assessment of amylase levels in the perfusate, fat infiltration\n(detected using standard histology), and exocrine pancreas\nfunction as criteria to assess graft viability during NMP (55).\nConcerning heart transplantation, organ assessment during\nNMP mainly relies on metabolic parameters and measurements\nof lactate levels in the aortic root and pulmonary artery. In the\nPROCEED II trial, three hearts were discarded due to rising total\nperfusate lactate concentrations. Histopathological examination\nshowed myocardial injury (necrosis, hemorrhage, scarring) or\nleft ventricular hypertrophy in those organs (108). Calculations\nof pressure volume loops in the left and right ventricle\nhave been described by switching the heart into a “working\nmode” during NMP. Based on pressure-volume (PV) loop data,\nend-systolic elastance could be calculated as a parameter for\nventricular contractility (44, 132). Due to complicated clinical\ninterpretation and difficulties in reproducibility, “working mode”\nhas been removed from the OCS perfusion module. Contrast\nechocardiography or intravascular ultrasound of coronary\narteries might emerge as tools for anatomical and mechanical\nassessment during NMP but have not been implemented in\nclinical routine so far.\nIn EVLP, assessment of the organ relies primarily on\nfunctional and macroscopic parameters, as has been reviewed\nrecently (103). Adequate gas exchange, stable hemodynamic\nand ventilatory parameters, macroscopic evaluation (absence\nof oedema), bronchoscopy (absence of purulent secretion and\nerythema of the bronchus), and deflation after endotracheal\ntube disconnection (collapse test) during the evaluation period\nare the commonly used decision criteria for acceptance of the\nlung. Yet these criteria are not standardized and differ between\ntransplant centers (103). As physiological parameters are in\nthe lead for decision making in EVLP, clinical single-center\nstudies assessed different biomarkers and metabolic parameters\nof the perfusate or the bronchioalveolar lavage to predict organ\nacceptance and occurrence of early prostaglandin D3 (PGD3).\nMachuca et al. (133) showed that high levels of endothelin-1 (ET\ufffe1) and Big ET-1 measured in perfusate samples have prognostic\nvalue for decline in the lung because of subsequent development\nof poor physiological performance. Subsequently, the same group\nsuggested IL-8 as a powerful predictor for early graft dysfunction\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 11 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\n(134). Furthermore, IL-1β and IL-8 levels measured in the\nperfusate during EVLP were reported to inversely correlate with\nthe recipient oxygenation 24 h post-transplantation (135).\nInterestingly, given the observation that perfusate IL-1β and\nTNF-α at 30 min during EVLP were effective markers for\ndifferentiating between in-hospital survival and non-survival\npost-transplant, blocking the IL-1β pathway during EVLP\nmight reduce endothelial activation and subsequent neutrophil\nadhesion on reperfusion (136).\nIMMUNOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF\n(MARGINAL) ORGANS DURING MACHINE\nPERFUSION\nThe definition of marginal organs per se is a rather arbitrary one.\nThe most commonly used is the dichotomy between standard\ncriteria (SCD) and extended criteria donors (ECD), which is\nsimply discriminated by age and three donor criteria for the DBD\n(and, increasingly, DCD) kidney cohort (13, 137, 138). However,\nin clinical routine, it is not always straightforward to decide if an\norgan is within “standard criteria,” as there are plethora of factors\ninterfering with organ quality, i.e., estimated duration of CIT,\n(functional) WIT, or the grade of steatosis in liver and pancreas,\njust to mention a few.\nWhen we focus on the donor age only, a vast amount of\nliterature exists. There is evidence that the immunogenicity\nof elderly organs is increased, as it is believed that aging in\ncombination with injuries (i.e., brain death) induces a pro\ufffeinflammatory environment, which could lead to an activation\nof innate and adaptive immune responses (139–141). Aging\ninfluences cellular repair mechanisms, and it is known that\nthe number of MHC molecules present on the cellular\nsurface is increased by aged parenchymal cells (139). In\nexperimental studies, transplantation of elderly organs was\nassociated with a more powerful early immune response\ncompared to transplantation of younger ones. Recipients of\nsuch old grafts presented with a higher concentration of\neffector/memory T-cells with an increased alloreactivity, leading\nto acute rejection, which results in a particular high burden\nof damage for the older donor organ (140). Elderly organs do\nnot have the same repair mechanism capabilities, so the clinical\ndamage of acute rejection leaves a more severe defect, explaining\nthe increased rates of DGF and/or graft loss in this donor\ncohort (140, 142).\nAn alteration of immunogenicity in aging organs could be\none reason to focus on preservation techniques (143) such\nas HMP and NMP to learn more about the process or even\nto (re-)condition an organ for reperfusion in the recipient.\nDue to the fact that the reconstitution of a near-physiological\nenvironment might work best to study immune cells, the\nfollowing paragraphs will bring NMP into focus.\nHuman organs are equipped with a sophisticated resident\nimmune system. The kidney, for example, not only hosts tissue\uffferesident macrophages (144); the organ also harbors lymphocytes,\ninnate lymphoid cells, natural killer (NK) cells, natural killer T\n(NKT) cells, and γδ T cells (145). The residential immune cells\nof human organs remain in a balanced homeostatic state unless\nthey are stimulated—by the insult of brain death in an organ\ndonor, for example—when an immunological activation might be\ninduced. Such a response to a significant injury like brain death in\nan organ donor includes both local and systemic inflammation,\ncomprising cellular infiltrates and a cytokine storm (146).\nWith the current gold-standard preservation technologies such\nas SCS, the organs will be transplanted unchanged, in an\nimmunologically activated status, into recipients in whom\nalloantigens will trigger another immune response immediately\nafter reperfusion, presented by donor-derived antigen presenting\ncells to recipient T cells (147, 148). How important donor\ufffederived leukocytes are in the allorecognition and rejection\nprocesses was demonstrated by Lechler and Batchelor years\nago. They impressively showed that placing a rat kidney into\nan intermediate recipient before implanting it into the final\nrecipient could significantly prolong allograft survival. These\nexperiments demonstrated that “clearing” the organ of dendritic\ncells (DC), the “passenger leukocytes” responsible for activating\nrecipient T cells, by using the intermediate rat led to the desired\nsuccess (149, 150). “Parking” the organ in an interim host\nis not a feasible strategy for implementation in the clinical\nroutine. However, NMP offers the possibility to represent the\nintermediate recipient as a conditioning tool to achieve the same\nend result, as previously published by Lechler et al. (150). An\nex vivo setting might provide not only a more physiological\npreservation method but also the ability to assess the organ\nprior to transplantation and to investigate its immunological\ncharacteristics in isolation (42).\nOne of the leading groups analyzing marginal and SCD\norgans after ex vivo perfusion is the Manchester group around\nFildes and Stone. Already in 2015, they compared the clinical\noutcome of patients transplanted with marginal donor lungs\nafter undergoing EVLP compared to standard transplantation\nof acceptable lungs (151). Despite having transplanted marginal\nlungs, there was no significant difference in the clinical outcome\nup to 12 months after transplantation concerning the overall\nincidence of acute rejection and the number of treated infection\nepisodes (151). This work was followed by a study on passenger\nleukocyte migration from donor lungs into the recipients and\nthe effects of donor leukocyte depletion prior to transplantation\nusing EVLP (152). In this experimental work using a porcine\nmodel, Stone et al. illustrated that donor leukocyte transfer\ninto the recipient was reduced by EVLP and therefore reduces\ndirect allorecognition and T-cell priming (152). The same group\ntransferred their experience to an ex vivo NMP model to analyze\ndonor-derived leukocytes in a porcine renal transplantation\nmodel. Stone et al. were able to demonstrate that an inflammatory\ncytokine storm and the release of mitochondrial and genomic\nDNA were initiated in the NMP circuit prior to transplantation.\nHowever, the renal function was not impacted at all after\ntransplanting those organs. They suggest that NMP could be used\nto immunodeplete and to saturate the capacity of inflammation\nof donor kidneys before transplanting them (152). Amin et al.\n(153) evaluated the impact of a post-SCS-preservation flush on\nthe inflammatory burden of a limb allograft (a porcine model for\nvascularized composite allotransplantation). The venous effluent\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 12 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nafter flushing the limbs following either 2 or 6 h of SCS comprised\na large population of viable leukocytes, significant concentrations\nof pro-inflammatory cytokines and mitochondrial DNA. These\nresults support the hypothesis that flushing or dynamically\npreserving the organs prior to transplantation impacts the\ninflammatory burden otherwise transferred to the recipient upon\nreperfusion unchanged (153).\nLiver NMP has recently been implemented as a standard\nprocedure in the United Kingdom and been shown to improve\norgan utilization and post-transplant outcomes following phase I\nand phase III prospective randomized trials (62, 66). Jassem et al.\n(84) transplanted, compared, and analyzed 12 NMP-preserved\nlivers against 27 SCS-preserved livers to assess the impact of NMP\non IRI, necrosis, platelet deposition, neutrophil infiltration, and\nthe degree of steatosis after NMP or SCS pre- and post-perfusion.\nTheir results showed that, with NMP, there were altered gene\ufffeexpression profiles of liver tissue from pro-inflammation to\nregeneration, reduced numbers of interferon gamma (IFNγ)-\nand interleukin-17-producing T cells, and an enlarged pool\nof regulatory T cells. In addition, NMP liver tissue was less\nnecrotic and apoptotic compared to SCS-preserved livers, with\nless neutrophils infiltrating the periportal area (84).\nOverall, with the clinical and experimental evidence gained\nso far for the field of SOT, dynamic preservation methods -\nand NMP in particular - provide the means to introduce\norgan conditioning so as to lower immunogenicity as well as\npro-inflammatory markers while ensuring the promotion of\ngraft regeneration.\nIMMUNOMODULATION DURING MP\nMachine perfusion (MP) offers a previously non-existent link\nbetween basic and clinical science. The opportunity to treat an\norgan during preservation creates a new field of translational\nresearch. In this context, one of the main targets that can now\nbe addressed is the modulation of the immunogenicity of a\nspecific graft. In theory, such immunomodulation could allow the\nobviation of lifelong immunosuppression or even forge a path to\nthe holy grail in transplantation—the achievement of tolerance.\nImportantly, MP offers a platform to apply immunomodulatory\nstrategies that have been elucidated in in vitro or preclinical\nmodels in the past.\nIn the existing literature, three major such strategies have\nbeen investigated, which are discussed herein. One of the\nmost promising is the application of stem or progenitor\ncells, with the potential to suppress immunogenicity and help\nrepair injured tissue. Another strategy is the administration of\nanti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory drugs and agents, and,\nfinally, gene transduction by adenoviral vector gene delivery.\nThe majority of studies have been carried out under\nnormothermic conditions. However, oxygenated perfusion of\na graft per se seems not only to protect against preservation\ninjury but also to downregulate the immune system and\nblunt the alloimmune response, as was shown in a rodent\nmodel of hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) (154). In\nparticular, the constant flow of fluids in the vessels during MP is\nregarded to promote the expression of vasoprotective endothelial\ngenes, alleviating the microcirculatory failure associated with\nischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) (155–157). On the other\nhand, when it comes to additional modification, it is perfusion\nunder normothermic conditions that seems to represent the\nideal platform, since NMP grants a physiological metabolic\nstate (81, 158–160).\nMany of the ongoing studies addressing the field of\nimmunomodulation during MP are carried out in a porcine\nsetting, as pigs have appropriate size and anatomy as well\nas immunologic characteristics (161). Whereas, much of our\nknowledge on organ preservation is derived from various animal\nstudies (162), the porcine model above all has now evolved\nas an ideal model, making ex vivo porcine organ perfusion\nmodels a suitable platform for translational transplant research.\nAccording to a recent review, in 2017, 22 articles discussed ex\nvivo porcine organ perfusion within the context of transplant\npreservation surgery (162), but the number of articles has steadily\nincreased since then. However, also in this setting, it is important\nto highlight potential limitations when translating experiences\nbetween species (158).\nStem and Progenitor Cells\nSeveral candidate cells have been investigated, including stromal\nmesenchymal cells (MSCs), induced adult pluripotent stem cells,\nfetal stem cells from placenta, membranes, amniotic fluid, and\numbilical cord, and hematopoietic cells (163). Among these,\nMSCs have been reported to represent the most promising cell\nsubset. MSCs are multipotent cells that are found in adult tissues,\nincluding adipose tissue and bone marrow, where they support\nfunction and repair. Importantly, they have been shown to abate\nimmune and inflammatory responses via the release of paracrine\neffectors (164, 165).\nThis circumstance has led to a broad application of MSCs in\na variety of pathologies. Therefore, a prerequisite for research\non MSCs is the agreement on criteria that define these cells and\nallow comparability between studies. The International Society\nfor Cellular Therapy has established the minimum criteria that\na cell must meet to be considered an MSC: first, an MSC\nmust be plastic-adherent when maintained in standard culture\nconditions; second, an MSC must express CD105, CD73, and\nCD90 and lack expression of CD45, CD34, CD14 or CD11b,\nCD79alpha or CD19, and HLA-DR surface molecules; third, an\nMSC must differentiate into cell types of mesodermal origin in\nvitro (166, 167).\nThe fact that MSCs are known for their potent anti\ufffeinflammatory and regenerative capacities, combined with the\nfinding that a therapeutic effect can be achieved with either\nautologous or allogeneic MSCs (168), has led to the conduction of\nseveral studies investigating whether their application is feasible\nin the context of MP. However, the detailed mechanisms by\nwhich MSCs exert their anti-inflammatory and regenerative\npotential have not yet been depicted. The main mechanism of\naction is supposed to rely on secreted mediators. Therefore, an\nappropriate timeframe is likely to be required for these cells\nin order to mediate beneficial effects (169). This hypothesis is\nunderlined by the findings of a recent study in a porcine ex\nvivo lung perfusion (EVLP) model. Twelve-hour NMP of DCD\nlungs with intravascular delivery of MSCs (150 × 106\n) resulted\nin reduced levels of interleukin-8 (IL-8), a pro-inflammatory\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 13 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\ncytokine associated with reperfusion injury, along with increased\nlevels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (170). The\nfact that IL-8 was suppressed is of particular note, since MSCs are\nknown to produce the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which\nin turn has been reported to significantly suppress the production\nof IL-8 in a dose-dependent manner (169).\nIn human kidneys, Brasile et al. demonstrated actual\nrenal regeneration mediated by MSCs under 24 h of ex vivo\nnormothermic perfusion. The authors used an exsanguinous\nmetabolic support (EMS) tissue-engineering platform to study\nfive pairs of kidney allografts from DCD donors. Whereas, one\nkidney of each pair solely underwent perfusion, the partner\nkidney was EMS perfused with MSC (1 × 10). Indeed, a reduced\ninflammatory response was observed along with increased\nsynthesis of adenosine triphosphate and growth factors and a\nnormalization of the cytoskeleton and mitosis (171).\nEven though these findings are promising, more insight\nneeds to be gained regarding the effects of the NMP milieu\non MSC themselves and the comparability between human\nand porcine data. These aspects were highlighted in a kidney\nNMP model, showing that while the suspension conditions\nreduced the viability of porcine MSC by 40% in both perfusion\nfluid and culture medium, the viability of human MSC was\nreduced by suspension conditions by 15% in perfusion fluid,\nand no differences were found in survival in culture medium.\nFurthermore, it was shown that a freeze-thawing process\nimpaired survival, metabolism, and the ability to adhere to\nendothelial cells. The authors concluded that NMP conditions\naffect MSC but show sufficient support of their function and\nsurvival that MSC administration through NMP should be\nconsidered, and secondly that slight differences in the behavior\nof porcine and human MSC need to be taken into account (158).\nAnother recent analysis focused on the characteristics of\nculture-expanded MSC, investigating heir viability and homin\nduring NMP. Kidneys were perfused for 7 h in the presence\nof 105\n, 106\n, or 107 human adipose tissue-derived MSC. Intact\nMSCs were detected in the lumen of glomerular capillaries,\nbut only in the 107 MSC group. After a rapid decline of cell\nnumbers during NMP, only a small portion of the MSCs were\nintact, and these were clustered in a minority of glomeruli. Apart\nfrom outlining the complexity of MSC therapy during MP, the\nauthors concluded that “an exciting new window of opportunity\nmight emerge to actively pre-condition isolated organs in a fully\ncontrolled setting and in the absence of an immune response, before\nthey are transplanted” (172).\nIt is noteworthy that such promising findings have recently\nled to the creation of the international “MePEP consortium”\n(173) in order to study this novel modality of treatment in\npreparation for human trials. Therefore, more findings on MSC\nand immunomodulation can be expected in the near future.\nAnti-inflammatory Agents\nAlternatively, pharmacologic interventions to decrease\nimmunogenicity or prevent recurrent disease can be applied\nduring MP. The seemingly most obvious strategy to influence the\ninflammatory profile is the delivery of anti-inflammatory agents\ndirectly into the machine perfusion circuit, treating the liver\nex vivo during the preservation period to obviate the need for\nlifelong immunosuppression or to improve long-term outcomes\nseparate from the physiological quality of the organ at the time\nof transplantation (174).\nSeveral targets for potential agents have been identified.\nAmongst these is TNF-alpha, one of the most potent\nproinflammatory cytokines, which is released in response\nto and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of IRI (175, 176).\nTherefore, in a recent clinical HMP study, it was hypothesized\nthat the administration of the TNF-α inhibitor etanercept\ncould improve outcomes following kidney transplantation.\nHowever, no significant differences were found concerning\nkidney machine perfusion parameters, including average flow\nand vascular resistance, nor did the authors observe significant\nchanges regarding DGF, rejection episodes, or allograft survival\n(177). However, it has to be taken in mind that this study was\ncarried out under hypothermic conditions. Although possible in\nother machine-perfusion techniques, NMP seems to be ideal, as\nactive metabolism permits graft intervention and modification\nduring preservation, circumstances that are not present in\nHMP (178).\nMore promising data come from a porcine study in\nwhich a variety of agents were added to act at different\nlevels. Prostaglandin E1, a prostacyclin analog with vasodilator,\nantiplatelet, fibrinolytic, and several other anti-inflammatory\nproperties, was continuously administered. In addition, n\ufffeacetylcysteine was added due to its free radical scavenging\nproperties. Sevoflurane was administered due to its protective\nproperties on endothelial cells, and carbon monoxide was\nadded with the objective of improving vasodilatation and\nreducing inflammation. Indeed, during a 3-day follow-up after\ntransplantation, this treatment resulted in lower AST levels as\nwell as lower levels of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF- α),\nand galactosidase and increased IL-10 levels (179).\nOther candidate markers for modulation during MP are anti\ufffeinflammatory receptors. In this context, the adenosine A2A\nreceptor downregulates inflammation, including the suppression\nof CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and increases endothelial cell\nnitric oxide (174). Since experiences in rabbit experiments\nshowed that adenosine A2A receptor activation can diminish\nIRI (180), a subsequent study evaluated whether treatment with\nan adenosine A2A receptor agonist could be beneficial during\nnormothermic ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP). Indeed, EVLP\nwith targeted A2AR agonist treatment could attenuate IRI after\ntransplantation of DCD donor lungs subjected to prolonged 12-h\ncold preservation in a preclinical porcine model (181).\nAdenoviral Vector Gene Delivery\nAs cellular metabolism is preserved during normothermic\nperfusion, it represents a potential platform for effective gene\ntransduction in a specific graft (182). To test this hypothesis\nin donor lungs, Yeung et al. used a porcine model of\nEVLP and treated them with an E1-, E3-deleted adenoviral\nvector encoding either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or the\nimmunosuppressive interleukin-10 (IL-10). They observed a\ndecreased expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1,\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 14 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nTNF-α, and IL-6, as well as attenuation of the alloimmune\nresponse following transplantation (174, 182).\nThis finding is also of particular interest, since the delivery\nof adenoviral vectors could result in a prompt innate immune\nresponse by macrophages, recruiting circulating neutrophils,\nwhich in turn propagate the inflammatory response. Moreover,\nin the transplant setting, this preexisting inflammation could\npotentiate subsequent IRI (182, 183). Therefore, the authors\ncompared in vivo and ex vivo administration and showed that\ndonor lung is superior to in vivo delivery since it leads to less\nvector-associated inflammation (182).\nConcerning the kidney, already in 2002, proof of principle of\na similar technique had been reported by Brasile et al., using a\nrecombinant adenovirus, Ad5, CMV5 GFP encoded with green\nfluorescence protein. They achieved effective transfection and\nsynthesis during 24 h of ex vivo normothermic perfusion (184).\nOnly recently has a normothermic ex vivo organ perfusion\ndelivery method for cardiac transplantation gene therapy been\nreported. Adenoviral vector transduction was utilized to deliver\nparticles of an Adenoviral firefly luciferase vector with a\ncytomegalovirus (CMV) promotor to porcine donor hearts\nduring NMP and prior to heterotopic implantation. Along with\na high copy number of vector genomic DNA in transplanted\nhearts, there was no evidence of vector DNA in either the\nrecipient’s native heart or liver, substantiating the applicability\nand safety of the protocol.\nThese findings make it likely that this technology could be\nfeasible for other organ systems as well. A wide variety of\ninteresting genes could be targeted. As has been reviewed lately\n(159), promising possibilities arise when translating the findings\nof rodent models using adenoviruses expressing CTLA4Ig (185)\nto the setting of NMP; also, NMP could be used to deliver\ngene therapies that induce cytoprotection against IRI, such as\nmyr-Akt (159, 186).\nOutstandingly, Figueiredo et al. recently showed that antigen\nsilencing is feasible during NMP. In a porcine model of\nlung NMP, short hairpin RNAs were delivered by lentiviral\nvectors, successfully reducing the immunogenicity of the\nlung by silencing MHC expression on the endothelium.\nThe authors concluded that the decrease in immunogenicity\ncarries the potential to generate immunologically invisible\norgans to counteract the burden of rejection and\nimmunosuppression (187).\nOrgan Reconditioning and Repair\nRecent experimental data primarily focusing on marginal livers\nfurthermore suggested that NMP offers a platform for organ\nreconditioning and repair.\nImpressive data from Birmingham, UK, showed that livers\ndiscarded due to pronounced steatosis could be effectively treated\nwith defatting agents during 6 h of NMP. Tissue triglycerides\nwere lowered by 38% and macrovesicular steatosis by 40%, which\nwas associated with a down-regulation of inflammatory marker\nexpression relevant for oxidative injury and activation of immune\ncells (CD14; CD11b), combined with reduced inflammatory\ncytokines in the perfusate (TNFα, IL-1β) (188). In addition,\narterial vasospasm can be modulated by the application of ET-1\nantagonists, prostacyclin analog, or calcium channel antagonists\nduring NMP (189). Furthermore, NMP can be used for the\ndirect and efficient application of antiviral agents, as shown in\na porcine NMP model, in which Miravirsen, an inhibitor of\nhepatitis C virus (HCV) replication, produced improved uptake\ncompared to SCS control livers. The authors concluded that\nthis approach might offer a future strategy to prevent HCV\nreinfection after liver transplantation (190). Likewise, HCV\ufffeinfected human donor lungs could effectively be treated during\nshort-time EVLP via physical viral clearance combined with\ngermicidal light-based therapies (191).\nIn summary, immunomodulation in the context of MP seems\nto offer a plethora of novel strategies. A series of porcine\nand human studies distinctively underline its effectiveness and\nfeasibility. However, as formulated in a recent review (191, 192),\nthe studies conducted so far just scratch the surface of conceivable\ninterventions. In particular, NMP provides an ideal platform\nfor immunomodulatory modifications. The next step will be the\ntranslation of findings from preclinical and rodent models as well\nas HMP trials into the setting of NMP.\nTHE IMMEDIATE FUTURE IN THE\nTRANSPLANTATION OF MARGINAL\nORGANS\nMuch speculation about the changes in transplantation is\ncurrently energizing the field. The conceptual approach of\nextracorporal organ preservation and monitoring begs for\nspeculation about organ reconditioning, repair, and treatment.\nWhile these are all valid considerations and perfectly reasonable\nhopes, the implementation of machine perfusion is the first\nstep. Immediate and widespread adoption of HMP and NMP is\nunlikely since this technology does not immediately improve the\noutcome with regard to the primary endpoints in transplantation:\npatient and graft survival. Authority approval and market entry\nare largely based on secondary endpoints such as delayed\ngraft function (DGF, kidney) or primary poor function (PPF,\nliver), which are considered to serve as surrogates for improved\nlong-term results. The conceptual limitation with surrogates is,\nhowever, that the predictive value is not uniformly robust or\nformally established and immediately reproducible. The DGF\nrate, for example, in kidneys from DCD donors is high, but\nthe predictive value of DFG in these cases is low (193). The\ndefinition of PPF is mostly based on high AST/ALT values early\nafter transplantation. While these parameters indicate hepatocyte\ndamage, correlation with the eventual outcome is very limited\n(194). Hence, the adoption of the technology is possibly built\non the wish for innovation and the belief in the value of the\ntime gain with NMP. Preliminary data on HOPE in recent and\nongoing trials indicate a possible benefit in organ survival. If such\nan outcome is eventually formally achieved, the arguments for\nimplementation will be more substantial.\nFor clinical implementation, several regional and center\nfactors play an important role. First, the retrieval team\nmay be different from the team eventually performing the\ntransplantation. Even if the retrieval team is familiar with the\ntechnology, the preparation of the graft prior to NMP (more\nthan HMP) is more substantial and more definitive for the\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 15 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631\n\nResch et al. Machine Perfusion for Marginal Organs\nfate of the graft. Hence, in a system with longer-distance organ\nexchange, additional steps and a new routine would need to be\nestablished. The technology and the shifting of the work of the\nbacktable procedure to the retrieving team need to be considered.\nThe alternative approach where the organ is transferred to\nthe recipient center and is then machine perfused is currently\nbeing pursued, but data indicating the actual advantage of this\napproach are lacking (195). For now, NMP serves as a technology\nthat allows one important asset in surgery to be gained: time.\nThe value of time and flexibility is dependent on the regional\ncircumstances but may hold great potential for easing the surgery\nlogistics, working hours, and surgical training but also gives rise\nto higher risks of nighttime procedures. The actual value of time\nin this context, however, requires further attention and needs to\nbe better defined.\nThe consideration of longer-term organ preservation under\nnormothermic conditions further carries the challenge of\ndefining the responsibilities for managing and monitoring the\norgans. Eventually, the working place description of health\ncare workers involved in this will require adoption and formal\ntraining. Standard operating procedures (SOP) and safety\nparameters need to be established for a wider spread use of\nthe technology. It is likely that the advanced technological\nrequirements and the need for 24-h availability of knowhow and\npersonnel would favor the establishment of regional hubs for MP.\nDespite the hype in the field, the clinical adoption of MP is\nslow. In addition to the above-mentioned factors, the lack of\nreimbursement is a stringent limitation in many regions. For the\ntechnology to be reimbursed, the authorities will require hard\nfacts. Hence, the path to more widespread clinical use might\nbe long, and the focus should remain on the demonstration of\nsuperiority regarding the most relevant clinical endpoints.\nOne major important step toward collective advancement in\nthis field would be the definition of data points during and\nafter MP and the establishment of registries for coordinated\ndata collection. Such data points should include the definition\nand terminology of the various time points and actions such as\ncold flush and storage prior to MP, temperature and flow during\nMP, parameters indicating metabolic function and bile/urine\nproduction during MP, second flush, second cold ischemia time,\nand others. One of the hurdles in improving NMP is the\nlarge number of variables added to preservation. Identifying\nthe relevance of individual parameters will require attention\nto the details of the procedure and adequate data collection\nand handling. To the knowledge of the authors, no routine\ndata collection and no consensus toward data points have been\nestablished at present.\nThe decision-making process in MP is relatively arbitrary\nsince the data collected during MP are suggestive but not formally\nestablished as quality-defining parameters. Since the decision to\ntransplant an organ or not is extremely meaningful, great care\nneeds to be applied in the process, and detailed documentation\nof the reasoning for decision making should be carried out. A\ngreater effort toward orchestrated data collection could help to\nstreamline and eventually enhance the robustness of the decision\ufffemaking process.\nThe preference for MP to be used for the preservation\nof marginal organs results from the greater need for\norgan assessment and the greater potential benefit of better\npreservation. This might be particularly true and relevant for\norgans from uncontrolled DCDs, where the circumstances and\nthe accumulated damage to the organs might be less clear. The\nvalue of an additional assessment under these conditions is not\nonly meaningful with respect to the number of additional organs\nfor transplantation but also for preventing the transplantation\nof organs that are severely damaged. While the assessment\nof this subject would be highly valuable and is much needed,\nthe behavior of the investigators in the NMP trial by Nasralla\net al. indicates the limitations and conflicts observed with this\napproach (62). Since the trial cannot be fully blinded, the bias\ngenerated by the fact that a technology is used that is deemed\nsuperior and the data generated during MP define a deviation in\nthe behavior of the decision makers.\nTHE FAR FUTURE OF (MARGINAL) ORGAN\nTRANSPLANTATION\nThe fantasies building on the realization of extracorporal organ\npreservation under physiological conditions are currently\nfuelling hopes that this technology could facilitate tissue\nregeneration, organ repair, immunomodulation, xenograft\nhumanification, and many other things. MP as a platform\nmay impact medicine far beyond transplantation and delivers\na unique chance to alter the treatment of organ failure and\norgan disease. Between the imagination and the realization\nof medical advancement stands a mountain of work and an\nas yet unknown but probably large number of technical and\nmethodological challenges. An important initial goal is the\nexpansion of the duration of MP and the establishment of\nan equilibrium of the condition of the organ. Preservation\nof organs for several days will likely require additional\nmodifications from the currently existing technologies.\nPreservation of the acid-base equilibrium, nutrition organ\nweight-induced pressure, electrolyte shift, hemolysis, and many\nother challenges may require closer attention. A tissue- and/or\ncell-specific and targeted treatment is a realistic consideration,\nand proof of concept trials indicate the feasibility of this\napproach (196, 197). The treatment and replacement of\ndamaged or displaced elements of organs may evolve as a\nnew discipline and help the field to make the leap to serve\none of the greatest unmet needs: The effective treatment of\ndamaged organs.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nTR and SS conceived and designed the study and wrote the\nmanuscript.

How has the evidence changed regarding acceptable macro/microsteatosis in liver grafts?,"['nature publishing group\nHuman hepatocyte transplantation for liver disease: current\nstatus and future perspectives\nV Iansante1\n, R R Mitry1\n, C Filippi1\n, E Fitzpatrick1 and A Dhawan1\nLiver transplantation is the accepted treatment for patients\nwith acute liver failure and liver-based metabolic disorders.\nHowever, donor organ shortage and lifelong need for\nimmunosuppression are the main limitations to liver trans\ufffeplantation. In addition, loss of the native liver as a target organ\nfor future gene therapy for metabolic disorders limits the\nfuturistic treatment options, resulting in the need for\nalternative therapeutic strategies. A potential alternative to\nliver transplantation is allogeneic hepatocyte transplantation.\nOver the last two decades, hepatocyte transplantation has\nmade the transition from bench to bedside. Standardized\ntechniques have been established for isolation, culture, and\ncryopreservation of human hepatocytes. Clinical hepatocyte\ntransplantation safety and short-term efficacy have been\nproven; however, some major hurdles—mainly concerning\nshortage of donor organs, low cell engraftment, and lack of a\nlong-lasting effect—need to be overcome to widen its clinical\napplications. Current research is aimed at addressing these\nproblems, with the ultimate goal of increasing hepatocyte\ntransplantation efficacy in clinical applications.\nOrthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is currently\nconsidered the gold standard treatment for end-stage\nliver disease, acute liver failure, and liver-based metabolic\ndisorders, and is the only intervention with proven clinical\nbenefits and long-lasting effects. However, the shortage of\ndonors limits the number of patients who may benefit from\nOLT and means that there is a significant waiting list and high\nmortality. OLT has several disadvantages, including the risks\nof complications related to surgery, the high cost of the\nprocedure, and the need for lifelong immunosuppression.\nTheoretically, a potential alternative to liver transplantation is\nhepatocyte transplantation (HT), in which transplanted cells\nprovide the missing/impaired hepatic function once engrafted\ninto the recipient’s liver. Mature hepatocytes are considered\nthe most obvious cell type for liver cell transplantation since\nthey are the major functional components of the liver. In\nprinciple, hepatocyte transplantation has several advantages\nover OLT: (i) it is less invasive and less expensive not\ninvolving a complex surgery; (ii) it can be performed\nrepeatedly if required; (iii) cryopreserved cells isolated from\ndonor livers are available immediately when needed; (iv)\nnative liver remains in place serving as a backup in case of cell\ngraft failure and allowing potential regeneration in patients\nwith acute liver failure (ALF), as well as representing a\npossible target for future gene therapy in patients with liver\ufffebased metabolic disorders; and (v) because this procedure\nonly requires a fraction of the cells isolated from a donor\norgan, multiple patients can be treated from one donor tissue,\nthus saving other organs for patients who do require OLT.\nThe first experimental attempt of hepatocyte transplanta\ufffetion was developed in 1976 (1) to treat the hyperbilirubinemic\nGunn rat, an animal model for Crigler–Najjar syndrome type\nI (CN), and along with other preclinical observations (2–4), it\nled to the first transplant of autologous hepatocytes in 10\npatients with liver cirrhosis in 1992 in Japan with uncertain\nresults (5). Since then, reports have been published of more\nthan 100 patients with liver disease treated by HT worldwide\n(6). To date, human hepatocytes transplantation has resulted\nin partial correction of a high number of liver diseases\nincluding urea cycle disorders (7–9), factor VII deficiency\n(10), glycogen storage disease type 1 (11), infantile Refsum’s\ndisease (12), phenylketonuria (13), severe infantile oxalosis\n(14), and acute liver failure (15–18) (Table 1). The level of cell\nreplacement required to achieve physiological benefit varies\ndepending on the disease, and it has been considered around\n5 − 10% of theoretical liver mass in the transplantations carried\nout so far. Although encouraging clinical improvements are\nseen in patients transplanted with allogeneic hepatocytes, long\ufffeterm efficacy is still hampered by insufficient engraftment/\nlong-term acceptance of cellular allografts, despite immuno\ufffesuppression (19). Even though promising, HT still faces\nlimitations. First, there is a limited supply of donor livers from\nwhich high-quality hepatocytes can be isolated, as the source is\nsuboptimal livers that are otherwise unsuitable for organ\ntransplantation (20). These cells are often poorly functioning.\nSecond, cryopreservation of hepatocytes results in impaired cell\nviability after thawing due to freeze–thaw damage (21). Third,\ncell engraftment is quite poor, estimated to be from 0.1 to 0.3%\n1\nDhawanLab, Paediatric Liver GI and Nutrition Center and MowatLabs, Institute of Liver Studies, King’s College London, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King’s College\nLondon, King’s College Hospital, London, UK.

Finally, allogeneic rejection is most\nprobably the main cause for the observed decline of cell graft\nfunction within 1 year of HT (19). Although the safety of\nclinical HT has been very well established, therapeutic benefit\nhas been modest and only temporary so far. This is partially in\ncontrast with very convincing preclinical results obtained in a\nnumber of animal models of liver disease (2–4), possibly\nbecause these models do not properly mimic the disease in\nhumans. Animals usually develop liver injury within a few days\nor weeks, whereas in humans the injury is significantly more\nsevere occurring over many decades, thus highlighting a need\nof more realistic models of liver disease.\nPROCEDURES: HEPATOCYTE SOURCE, ISOLATION, QUALITY\nCONTROL, AND ADMINISTRATION FOR CELL\nTRANSPLANTATION\nHuman hepatocytes are isolated from (i) whole donor livers\nunsuitable/rejected for OLT, mostly because of severe\nsteatosis, prolonged ischemia time, older, or non-heart\ufffebeating donors, or (ii) from liver segments, mainly I and\nIV, which are available for cell isolation after split liver\ntransplantation. Alternatively, fetal and neonatal livers are\nbeing explored as a potential cell source (23,24) as they are\ncurrently not considered for OLT and may allow the isolation\nof very high-quality cells (9). Neonatal-derived hepatocytes,\nalthough not fully mature, show activity of some of the main\nenzymes responsible for hepatic-detoxifying functions (23).\nExplanted livers from patients with liver-based metabolic\ndisorders have also been considered as a potential source of\ncells. This concept was adopted from a similar approach used\nin the so-called “domino” liver transplantation performed\nsince the mid-1990s, in which a liver transplant recipient with\na known metabolic defect can donate his explanted native\nliver for use as liver graft in another patient (25). In a similar\nway, liver explants from patients with defined metabolic\ndisorders could become a source of hepatocytes, since their\nmissing enzymatic function would be performed by the\nrecipient’s native liver, left in place. This approach was used in\na 6-year-old boy with severe phenylketonuria transplanted\nwith hepatocytes isolated from a glycogen storage type 1b\nliver explant, with significant reduction of blood phenylala\ufffenine levels up to 3 months after transplantation (13).\nIn order to isolate the hepatocytes, a standardized three-step\ncollagenase perfusion technique originally developed by Berry\nand Friend and later modified (26–28) is used. First, major\nhepatic vessels are cannulated and perfused with Hank’s buffered\nsalt solution (HBSS) containing EGTA, which is able to chelate\ncalcium ions, thus disrupting the desmosomes, calcium\ufffedependent cell-to-cell adhesions. Second, the liver is flushed\nwith plain HBSS to remove any residue of EGTA. Third, the\ntissue is perfused with a calcium-dependent collagenase solution\nto digest the extracellular matrix. After breaking of the liver\ncapsule, the released liver cells are filtered and centrifuged at low\nspeed to separate hepatocytes from nonparenchymal cells.\nHepatocytes can be used fresh for transplantation or cryopre\ufffeserved. Several protocols have been described to cryopreserve\nhuman hepatocytes, with the best results being achieved\ncryopreserving 106\n–107 cells/ml in the University of Wisconsin\norgan preservation solution containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide\nand 5% glucose, and using a controlled-rate freezer (29).\nCryopreserved hepatocytes are then stored at –140 °C until\nrequired for HT. Hepatocyte isolations for use in clinical HT\nmust be performed under good manufacturing practice (GMP)\nin an aseptic and accredited units.\nEvaluation of hepatocyte quality before transplantation is\nvital, especially on cryopreserved cells, as it has been shown\nthat freeze-thawing cycles damage mitochondria, affect cell\nrespiration with a dramatic drop of ATP levels (21), and may\ninduce apoptosis (unpublished data). Most centers use trypan\nblue exclusion test as the main and often only criterion to\nassess cell quality before transplantation, usually accepting\ncells with viability equal or higher than 60% for clinical\napplications. However, viability assessment does not detect\nany sign of early apoptosis in the cells or their functions,\nwhich should probably be included in the cell quality control\nto ensure that high-quality hepatocytes are transplanted (30).\nIn keeping with GMP standards, microbiological analysis\nmust be undertaken at each stage of cell preparation and the\nfinal product must be exempt from any contamination before\nrelease of hepatocytes for cell transplantation.\nThe most widely used administration route for clinical delivery\nof HT is intraportal infusion, with the catheter placed in the\nportal vein or in one of its branches. In newborn babies, the\nportal vein can be accessed by catheterization of the umbilical\nTable 1.

In older children, a cut-down approach may be used or a\nlaparoscopic/mini laparotomy insertion of a central venous\ncannula into a tributory of the portal vein. Hepatocytes\n(~20 − 40 μM in diameter) move across the sinusoidal vessels\nand induce transient occlusions in the periportal vascular areas\ndependent on cell size, followed by restoration of normal blood\nflow by vascular permeabilization, which allows transplanted\ncells to reach the liver parenchyma (31,32). Hepatocytes\nremaining in the portal vessels are cleared by macrophages\nwithin 24 h. The number of cells injected is limited by portal\npressure, which should be monitored throughout by Doppler\nultrasound, and should not exceed 12 mm Hg to avoid the risk\nof portal hypertension (33). Cell dose and infusion rate depend\non the patient weight and clinical situation, with the aim of\ninjecting around 5% of the total liver mass. Most centers\nconsider a dose of 2 × 108 cells per kg of body weight as the\nupper safe limit for hepatocyte transplantation. In some\nsituations when a high number of cells is needed to ensure\nclinical benefits, multiple infusions can be performed. Intras\ufffeplenic administration has been suggested as an alternative to\nintraportal injection in patients with liver cirrhosis, in whom\naltered liver architecture impacts hepatocyte engraftment (34).\nThe peritoneal cavity represents an attractive administration\nroute as it is easily accessible and may contain a large number of\ncells. For these reasons, it has been used in patients with acute\nliver failure (15,17). However, lack of anchorage for the\ntransplanted cells and host immune response result in a rapid\ndecline in transplanted cell viability. A way to overcome this\nproblem is the encapsulation of hepatocytes in alginate\nmicrobeads so that immune cells cannot reach them, thus\nprolonging their survival (35).\nINDICATIONS\nHepatocyte transplantation has been used clinically both in\ncongenital metabolic disorders affecting the liver and acute\nliver failure (Table 1). The most encouraging outcomes have\nbeen shown in liver-based metabolic disorder, where the\nnumber of cells needed to compensate for a single gene defect\nis lower than that for acute liver failure.\nInborn Errors of Liver Metabolism\nUrea cycle defects represent the most common liver-based\nmetabolic disorders treated with hepatocyte transplantation. These\ndiseases are characterized by an incapacity of fully converting\nammonia into urea, with hyperammonemic crisis, frequently\nleading to death. To date, hepatocyte transplantation has been\nused in different types of urea cycle defects, including ornithine\ntranscarbamylase (OTC) deficiency (7,36–40), argininosuccinate\nlyase (ASL) deficiency (8), citrullinemia (7), and carbamoylpho\ufffesphate synthetase (CPS) deficiency (7,40). Although most patients\nshowed clinical benefits, the effects were not maintained over the\nlong term. Soltys et al. recently published findings from two\npatients with urea cycle defects, who underwent hepatocyte\ntransplantation after preconditioning with irradiation. The two\npatients, a 4-month-old girl with CPS1 deficiency and a 7-month\ufffeold child with OTC deficiency, received 1.25 and 2.0 × 108 viable\nhepatocytes/kg body weight, respectively. Clinical benefits were\nseen in the patient with OTC deficiency, however, after around\n40 days, the child developed frequent hyperammonemia. Both\nchildren received an OLT after a few months (40).\nCrigler–Najjar syndrome is due to a defective UDP\ufffeglucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzyme determining increased\nserum-unconjugated bilirubin levels, which can lead to severe\nbrain damage and death. Current treatments include liver\ntransplantation and phototherapy. There are reports of patients\nwho have received up to 7.5 billion hepatocytes, showing up to\n50% reduction in bilirubin and increase in UGT activity. The\nmajority of these patients received an OLT within a year. One\npatient was transplanted 4 years later (41–43).\nGlycogen storage disease type I is due to mutations impairing\nthe activity of glucose-6-phosphatase complex, with abnormal\naccumulation of glycogen and fat in the liver and kidneys.\nHepatocyte transplantation was used in two adults with\nimproved glucose control up to 7 − 9 months (11,44).\nOther liver-based metabolic diseases shown to improve\nfollowing hepatocyte transplantation include factor VII (fVII)\ndeficiency, where there was a 70% reduction in the need for\nrecombinant fVII for 6 months (10), and familial hyperch\ufffeolesterolemia, where autologous ex vivo-corrected hepatocytes\nwere transplanted with not significant clinical improvement,\nprobably due to low efficiency of genetic correction (45). In\naddition, hepatocyte transplantation has been used to treat\npatients with alpha1-antitrypsin (34), infantile Refsum’s\ndisease (12), primary oxalosis (14), and phenylketonuria\n(13,40). Safety of the method was confirmed in all these\ntreatments, however, similarly to the other diseases treated,\nefficacy was not maintained over the long term.\nAcute Liver Failure\nHepatocyte transplantation aims to bridge patients with acute\nliver failure to recovery through regeneration of their own\nliver or to OLT in case an organ becomes available. Cell\nnumber necessary to provide hepatic function able to replace\nthe injured liver is slightly higher than for metabolic\ndisorders, estimated to be ~ 10 − 15% of liver cell mass (46).\nCell transplantation through the portal system is not always\npossible in these patients, due to frequent coagulopathy issues;\ntherefore, other administration routes have been used, such as\nintraperitoneally (15,17) or intrasplenic (16,34).\nIn many cases, hepatocyte transplantation in patients with\nfulminant liver failure resulted in clinical improvements with\nreduction in ammonia and bilirubin and hepatic encephalo\ufffepathy, as already extensively described in other reviews\n(34,47). However, it is difficult to conclude about the efficacy\nof this approach without randomized controlled trials.\nIMMUNOSUPPRESSION AND IMMUNE RESPONSE TO CELL\nGRAFT\nThere is no consensus regarding the optimum immunosup\ufffepressive treatment following HT. Most centers have adapted\nimmunosuppressive protocol used for orthotopic liver\ntransplantation to HT. Common immunosuppressive\nReview | Iansante et al.\n234 Pediatric RESEARCH Volume 83 | Number 1 | January 2018 Copyright © 2018 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.\n\nregimens include induction with steroids and calcineurin\ninhibitors (tacrolimus or cyclosporine) (8,10,11,42). Some\ncenters have also included therapy with anti-interleukine-2\nreceptor antibodies (basiliximab) (7). Experiences with OLT\nhave highlighted that liver is an immune-privileged organ,\nleading in some cases to graft tolerance development and\npossibility of immunosuppression withdrawal. Hepatocyte\ntransplantation has been erroneously considered similar to\nliver transplantation in terms of immunogenicity and it was\ninitially assumed that hepatocytes would have the same\nimmune privilege as the whole liver. Unfortunately, allogeneic\nhepatocytes seem to be highly antigenic in vivo unlike the liver\n(20). This discrepancy between inherent tolerogenicity of\nwhole-liver and isolated hepatocytes may suggest that either\nother hepatic cells like stellate cells or liver sinusoid\nendothelial cells contribute to liver tolerance (48) or that\nhepatocytes lose their tolerogenic potential in an allogeneic\nenvironment (49). Rejection of hepatocytes is mediated by\nboth the innate and adoptive immunity, and detailed\nelucidation of the mechanisms involved will probably\nimprove HT outcome.\nThe innate immune system plays a critical role after HT, as\nit has been demonstrated that up to 70% of transplanted\nhepatocytes might be eliminated by early phagocytic immune\nresponse, without significant differences between allogeneic\nand syngeneic cell transplantation (50). Different mechanisms\nseem to be involved in hepatocyte early rejection. First, part of\nthe transplanted cells undergo cytolysis mediated by granu\ufffelocytes and monocytes activated by surface adhesion proteins\nexpressed on hepatocyte cell membrane, like cadherins,\notherwise hidden and inaccessible to them in case of whole\ufffeliver transplantation (51). Second, a process first described in\nislet transplantation and known as “instant blood-mediated\ninflammatory reaction” (IBMIR) is partly responsible for cell\nloss. The IBMIR is initiated by tissue factor expressed on\nhepatocyte cell membrane and is characterized by activation\nof the coagulation and complement systems, binding of\nactivated platelets to hepatocyte surfaces with formation of\nclots, and infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes\nresulting in the loss of transplanted cells (52,53).\nIn addition to the innate immune response, hepatocytes are\nalso rejected by the adaptive immune system. It has been\nshown that injecting hepatocytes in T-cell-deficient mice\nimproved cell graft survival, not observed in case of\nB-deficient, or selectively CD4+ or CD8+ T-cell-deficient\nmice, suggesting that immunologic rejection of allogeneic\nhepatocytes is mediated primarily by T cells (54). More recent\nstudies showed a lack of donor-specific antibodies, confirming\nthat humoral B-cell-mediated response may be not involved\nin hepatocyte rejection (38).\nIMPROVEMENT IN ENGRAFTMENT/PROLIFERATION OF\nTRANSPLANTED CELLS\nThe outcome of HT is strictly dependent on the level of\nengraftment of transplanted hepatocytes into the recipient’s\nliver (Figure 1). This concept applies both to acute liver\nfailure and liver-based metabolic diseases. In case of metabolic\ndisorders, the ultimate goal is to achieve a long-lasting level of\ncell integration allowing a stable expression of the missing\nprotein/enzyme over time. Several strategies have been\ninvestigated to increase engraftment and/or proliferation of\ntransplanted hepatocytes. There has been much interest in\nusing the therapy in certain diseases that provide a natural\nselective advantage for transplanted cells, such as hereditary\ntyrosinemia type I (55), alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency (56),\nand Wilson’s disease (57). Unfortunately, most liver diseases\ndo not offer a selective advantage to transplanted cells, thus\nmaking necessary the development of new strategies to\nachieve this aim, including genetic modification of donor cells\nor induced injury to the recipient’s liver.\nA study aiming to enhance the proliferation capacity of\ndonor hepatocytes before transplantation showed that\ntransfecting freshly isolated murine hepatocytes ex vivo with\nthe nonviral sleeping beauty (SB) transposon vector carrying\nFoxM1 gene, a known cell-cycle regulator, significantly\nimproved liver repopulation without inducing tumorigenesis\n(58). Many attempts have been made to precondition the\nrecipient’s liver and give a selective advantage to the\ntransplanted cells, mainly partial hepatectomy (59), portal\nembolization (60), and liver irradiation (40), as suggested by a\nconsensus meeting held in London in 2009, where the main\nrepresentatives of the active clinical hepatocyte transplant\nprograms identified the main limitations of HT and suggested\nsolutions to overcome them (61).\nPartial hepatectomy has been successfully used in several\nanimal models of liver disease and showed significant liver\nrepopulation (62,63). Despite its clinical safety being reported\nmore than two decades ago (45), there are still some doubts\nabout its efficacy in humans. Recently, two patients with\nCrigler–Najjar syndrome type I underwent partial hepatect\ufffeomy followed by hepatocyte transplantation. Even though cell\ngraft function was lost in one patient for discontinuation of\nimmunosuppression, the other patient showed a decrease of\nbilirubin to ≈50% of pretransplant concentrations for more\nthan 6 months. However, he finally underwent liver\ntransplantation since graft functions were completely lost\n~ 600 days after HT (59).\nAnother approach to improve donor hepatocyte engraft\ufffement is partial embolization of the portal vein. This procedure\nis routinely used in patients undergoing liver resection in case\nthe remaining liver is too small to ensure hepatic function\n(64). Portal vein embolization (PVE) is safe, well tolerated by\npatients, and induces hypertrophy of nonembolized liver\nlobes. Dagher et al. (60) demonstrated that PVE of 50% of the\nliver mass followed by HT in Macaca monkeys resulted in\nreplacement of 10% of the organ total volume in the\nnonembolized lobe, and reversible PVE obtained with an\nabsorbable material determined similar results (65). Partial\nhepatectomy with PVE was used in nonhuman primates and\nin Watanabe-heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits, an animal\nmodel of familial hypercholesterolemia type IIa (FH),\nHepatocyte transplantation | Review\nCopyright © 2018 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc. Volume 83 | Number 1 | January 2018 Pediatric RESEARCH 235\n\nfollowed by transplantation of autologous hepatocytes\ntransduced ex vivo with lentiviral vectors (65,66).\nIrradiation of the native liver has been investigated as a way\nto inhibit native hepatocyte proliferation and enhance the\nengraftment and proliferation of donor hepatocytes. Pre\ufffeclinical studies of HT in the Gunn rat model of Crigler–Najjar\nsyndrome type I, showed that preparative hepatic irradiation\non a portion of the liver combined with stimulation of\nhepatocyte proliferation by administration of hepatocyte\ngrowth factor viral vector 24 h after HT led to a complete\ncorrection of the metabolic defect during the 16-week\nobservation period (67). A recent study showed that porcine\nhepatocytes were transplanted into immunosuppressed non\ufffehuman primates preconditioned with 10 Gy liver-directed\nirradiation targeting the right lobe, engrafted, and proliferated\nconstituting up to 15% of the irradiated lobe (40).\nFurthermore, irradiation as a host-preconditioning approach\nwas used in three patients treated with HT. Two infants with\nurea cycle defects preconditioned with irradiation on 1/3 of\nthe liver mass before HT showed early graft loss. Immune\nrejection was monitored through measurement of CD154+\nT-cytotoxic memory cells (TcM), shown to predict acute\ncellular rejection in children with intestine and liver\ntransplantation (68,69). CD154+ TcM were measured in a\n16-h mixed lymphocyte culture, consisting of recipient\nperipheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) cocultured with donor\nor third-party HLA-mismatched PBL. If donor lymphocytes\nwere not available, PBL from normal human HLA-matched\nsubjects were used. The immunoreactivity index (IR),\nrepresented by the ratio of donor-induced to third-party\ufffeinduced CD154+ TcM, was analyzed every 7 days after cell\ntransplantation and used as a sign of increased risk of\nrejection when IR≥ 1.3.

Despite the encouraging\nresults, the authors of this study highlighted that the level of\ndonor hepatocyte replacement was lower than expected,\npresumably because HT was performed too early within 24 h\nafter preconditioning (40).\nAn additional difficulty in cell engraftment evaluation after\nHT is the lack of tracking methods to measure the number of\ntransplanted hepatocytes in an accurate and noninvasive way.\nIn preclinical studies, cells can be easily labeled with\ntransfection/transduction of a fluorescent protein or pre\ufffestained with a dye and monitored over time. However, this\napproach is not applicable in humans. Hepatocyte labeling\nwith radioactive indium-111 was used in a 5-year-old child\nwith OTC deficiency treated with HT and resulted in a\nnoninvasive analysis of the biodistribution of transplanted\nhepatocytes (70). Although promising, this technique can be\nuseful only for short-time tracking, being limited by the short\nhalf-life of the radioisotope. Labeling with magnetic resonance\ncontrast agents has also been proposed (71) and investigated\nin preclinical studies (72). In liver-based metabolic disorders,\nindirect evidence of engraftment after HT can be obtained\nfrom levels of metabolic products as a consequence of the\nintroduction of the missing enzyme/protein (e.g., decrease of\nammonia in urea cycle defects and bilirubin in Crigler–Najjar\npatients). However, these measures do not provide reliable\ninformation about the exact number of functioning engrafted\nhepatocytes. Direct evidence of engraftment can be obtained\nby analyzing liver biopsies for sex chromosome, short tandem\nrepeats, or HLA antigens, if different in a recipient and a\ndonor (22,73). However, biopsies are not always available,\nbeing invasive. Furthermore, they only sample a very small\nproportion of tissue, thus being unrepresentative of the entire\nliver. An alternative approach to quantify cell engraftment\nafter HT could be the quantification of proteins released in\nthe bloodstream carrying polymorphisms in a donor and\nrecipient detectable by mass spectrometry (e.g., apolipopro\ufffetein and haptoglobin). A similar approach may consist of the\ncharacterization of exosome cargos released by donor grafts,\nas shown in a xenogeneic islet transplant model (74). High\ninterest has been recently shown for the development of new\nmethods to measure graft rejection. Since cell-free circulating\nDNA (cf-DNA) is released into the bloodstream by necrotic\nand apoptotic cells and can be genotyped and matched to\ndonor cells, it has been successfully used as a marker of early\nrejection in patients after liver transplantation (75). However,\nadditional studies are required to investigate whether this\nmethod can be translated to the detection of rejection in case\nof cell transplantation, where the number of cells releasing cf\ufffeDNA is significantly lower than in organ transplantation.\nFUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\nThe improvement of cell engraftment by host conditioning or\ndonor cell modification, as well as a better understanding of\nthe immune responses involved in hepatocyte rejection are\ndefinitely needed in order to overcome the issues limiting HT\nefficacy. In addition to this, a limited source of hepatocytes\nand often poor quality of isolated cells still represent an issue\nfor wider clinical applications. Other cell sources, combina\ufffetion therapies, and cell transplantation strategies have been\nconsidered to improve HT outcome.\nMesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) represent an attractive\ntool for regenerative medicine due to their ability to\nproliferate and differentiate, as well as their anti\ufffeinflammatory and immune-privileged status. MSCs exist in\nmany tissues, including bone marrow, umbilical cord, and\nadipose tissues, and are able to differentiate in mesenchymal\ntissue cells, i.e., adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes.\nMSCs have recently been isolated from the liver and named\nliver-derived human MSCs (LHMSCs). Some studies have\nshown that these cells can be transdifferentiated into\nhepatocyte-like cells, thus potentially being used for cell\ntransplantation in liver-based disorders (76,77). Although it is\nstill debated whether LHMSCs may efficiently repopulate a\nhost liver and provide adequate hepatic function (78), their\nanti-inflammatory role is undoubted (79). Furthermore,\nMSCs derived from bone marrow or umbilical cord and\ncocultured in vitro with human hepatocytes have shown\nsignificant improvement of hepatic functions (80), suggesting\nthat cotransplanting these cells and/or possibly LHMSCs with\nhepatocytes might ameliorate HT outcome, decreasing\ninflammation and improving hepatocyte performance.\nThere has been worldwide interest in the reprogramming of\ndifferentiated somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells\n(iPSCs), which can be potentially differentiated into cells\nbelonging to any germ layer, including cells with hepatocyte\ufffelike morphology and function, known as hepatocyte-like cells\n(HLCs) (81). Several groups have developed efficient and\nstandardized protocols for the development of iPSC-derived\nHLCs, some with GMP-approved protocols and reagents.\nHowever, HLCs generated by current methods are not fully\nmature, being phenotypically and functionally more similar to\nfetal than adult hepatocytes, with low albumin and urea\nproduction, and persistent high expression of alpha-fetopro\ufffetein, despite showing some CYP450 activity, as well as\nglycogen and lipid storage activity (82). It is likely that these\nhurdles regarding iPSC-derived HLC production will be\novercome in the near future, with several groups working on\nthis worldwide (83). However, a main safety concern for\nclinical applications is their tumorigenic potential, which\nneeds to be solved before these cells can be used safely in\nhumans.\nIn an attempt to decrease the immune response against\ntransplanted allogeneic cells in patients with liver-based\nmetabolic defects and thus improving engraftment, ex vivo\ngenetic correction of hepatocytes for autologous transplanta\ufffetion may be considered. This approach was used more than\ntwo decades ago in five patients with familial hypercholester\ufffeolemia who underwent partial hepatectomy of the left lateral\nlobe, followed by hepatocyte isolation, retroviral transduction\nHepatocyte transplantation | Review\nCopyright © 2018 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc. Volume 83 | Number 1 | January 2018 Pediatric RESEARCH 237\n\nof the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, and autologous\ntransplantation. Although significant and prolonged reduc\ufffetions in LDL cholesterol were demonstrated in three out of\nfive patients, the use of retroviral viruses—unable to transduce\nnonproliferating cells—drastically impaired clinical efficacy\n(45). This approach has been recently reconsidered in a\nporcine model of hereditary tyrosinemia type I, in which\nex vivo transduction of hepatocytes with lentiviral vector\ncarrying FAH missing gene was performed followed by\nautologous transplantation, with very encouraging results\n(84). This approach would be even more promising if applied\nto HLC derived from iPSCs, thus decreasing the invasiveness\nof the method.\nFinally, a simple approach to avoid the immune reaction\nduring HT has been proposed for the management of patients\nwith ALF. Human hepatocytes can be encapsulated in alginate\nmicrobeads (85), and then transplanted intraperitoneally.\nThis approach would allow transplanted donor hepatocytes to\nperform all the hepatic functions absent in the failing liver,\nwithout the need of immunosuppression as the alginate would\nbe able to protect donor cells from the host immune cells. The\ntechnique has been proven successful in a rat model of acute\nliver injury (35), and has shown encouraging results when\nused in children with ALF (unpublished). Furthermore, a\nrecent study has shown that alginate microbeads containing\nhepatocytes can be cryopreserved with some maintenance of\nhepatic functions after thawing, figuring the possibility of an\noff-the-shelf product available in an emergency setting typical\nof fulminant liver failure (86).\nCONCLUSION\nThe last two decades have seen a considerable development of\nhepatocyte transplantation, with demonstration of short-term\nefficacy and safety. However, some hurdles still need to be\novercome to widen hepatocyte transplantation clinical\napplications, mainly regarding isolation of high-quality cells\nfrom marginal donor liver, improvement of cell engraftment,\nand long-lasting effects, as well as optimal immunosuppres\ufffesion regimen identification.\nNew challenges are needed to improve hepatocyte trans\ufffeplantation efficacy, and include mainly the identification of\nnew cell sources, which could overcome liver donor scarcity,\nand new approaches to decrease the impact of immune\nresponse against transplanted cells, hence improving cell\nengraftment in liver-based metabolic disorders.\nSTATEMENT OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT\nThe authors acknowledge “MowatLabs” for financial support.\nDisclosure: The authors declare no conflict of interest.\nREFERENCES\n1.

However, recipients still need long-term immunosuppressive drug treatment\nto control allogeneic immune rejection, which may cause various complications\nand affect the long-term survival of the recipient. Many liver transplant researchers\nconstantly pursue the induction of immune tolerance in liver transplant recipients,\nimmunosuppression withdrawal, and the maintenance of good and stable graft function.\nAlthough allogeneic liver transplantation is more tolerated than transplantation of other\nsolid organs, and it shows a certain incidence of spontaneous tolerance, there is\nstill great risk for general recipients. With the gradual progress in our understanding\nof immune regulatory mechanisms, a variety of immune regulatory cells have been\ndiscovered, and good results have been obtained in rodent and non-human primate\ntransplant models. As immune cell therapies can induce long-term stable tolerance, they\nprovide a good prospect for the induction of tolerance in clinical liver transplantation. At\npresent, many transplant centers have carried out tolerance-inducing clinical trials in liver\ntransplant recipients, and some have achieved gratifying results. This article will review the\ncurrent status of liver transplant tolerance and the research progress of different cellular\nimmunotherapies to induce this tolerance, which can provide more support for future\nclinical applications.\nKeywords: tolerance, liver transplantation, operational tolerance, cell therapy, hematopoietic stem cell\ntransplantation, regulatory T cells, regulatory dendritic cells\nINTRODUCTION\nLiver transplantation has been a preferred option for patients with end-stage liver disease. Since Dr.\nStarzl performed the first human liver transplantation in 1963, the short-term survival rate of liver\ntransplant recipients has improved significantly, which can be attributed to advances in surgical\ntechniques and immunosuppression (IS) agents (1). However, owing to the long-term use of IS\nagents, complications concerning the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems, diabetes, chronic\nrenal insufficiency, infection, or tumors seriously affect the long-term survival of liver transplant\nrecipients (2, 3).\n\nDu et al. Liver Transplant Tolerance\nImmunological self-tolerance refers to the ability of a healthy\nimmune system to produce a protective immune response to\npathogens and foreign antigens while maintaining tolerance to\nits own tissues. Therefore, transplant tolerance refers to accepting\norgans without the need for long-term IS and maintaining\nprotective immunity (4). Tolerance is usually classified as\ncomplete immune tolerance, operational tolerance (OT), and\nprope tolerance, referred to a condition with a low, non-toxic\ndose of IS (5). In clinical applications, the focus of the study is\nOT, that is, long-term functional graft survival in a patient not\nrequiring maintenance IS (6).\nThe liver is an immunologically privileged organ compared\nto other transplant organs such as the heart, kidney, or pancreas\n(7). Liver transplant recipients generally maintain a low level of\nIS and the hepatic graft can provide immunological protection\nwhen transplanted in combination with other solid organs (8).\nSince Calne first recognized the liver tolerance effect (8) in\n1969, people have been enthusiastic about the induction of liver\nimmune tolerance.\nAs the body’s largest digestive organ, the liver has two\nsets of blood supplies, the portal vein and the hepatic\nartery. It is constantly exposed to enterically-derived blood\ufffeborne pathogens, which gives the liver a unique form of\nimmune privilege (9). Numerous sinuses constitute the largest\nreticuloendothelial system in the human body and contain\nthe largest number of specialized and non-specialized antigen\ufffepresenting cells (APC) and cells that maintain liver immune\ntolerance, including resident macrophages (also known as\nKupffer cells), dendritic cells, hepatocytes, hepatic sinusoidal\nendothelial cells (LSECs), and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) (10).\nWhen pathogen-derived products such as lipopolysaccharides\npass through the liver, like an immune filter, their concentration\ncould be reduced 100-fold, enabling the hepatic immune\nmicroenvironment to have sufficient capacity to regulate the\nnature and intensity of its response (11). Numerous immune\nregulatory mechanisms in the liver, including downregulation\nof co-stimulatory molecules, secretion of inhibitory cytokines,\ninhibition of effector T cell activation, and induction of\nregulatory T cells, predispose the immune response of the liver\nto tolerance rather than activation (12).\nCURRENT STATE IN SPONTANEOUS\nTOLERANCE\nFactually, in liver transplantation, spontaneous tolerance\ninitially came from the casual clinical observation. Owing\nto poor compliance, infection complications, posttransplant\nlymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) or doctor’s advice, some\nliver transplant recipients developed spontaneous tolerance after\nAbbreviations: IS, immunosuppression; OT, operational tolerance; APC, antigen\ufffepresenting cells; NK cells, natural killer cells; PBMC, peripheral blood\nmononuclear cells; HSCs, hematopoietic stem cells; HSCT, hematopoietic stem\ncell transplantation; GVHD, graft vs. host disease; Tregs, regulatory T cells; DC,\ndendritic cells; regDC, regulatory dendritic cells; tolDC, tolerogenic dendritic\ncells; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; GMP, Good\nmanufacturing practice.\ndiscontinuing IS, which has aroused great interest of transplant\nresearchers. In 1993, Reyes et al. in Pittsburgh reported that\n8 liver transplant recipients with poor compliance ceased IS\nfrom 0.5 to 11 years after transplantation, but unexpectedly\ndeveloped OT. Among them, after weaving from IS, 7 recipients\nmaintained good allograft function for 1 to 14.3 years. The\nremaining recipient underwent liver retransplantation after 7.7\nyears of IS withdrawal for viral hepatitis. In addition, 6 recipients\nwere shown to have systemic chimerism (13).\nOver nearly three decades, many liver transplant centers\nhave conducted clinical trials of IS withdrawal in both adult\nand pediatric liver transplant recipients. It has been reported\nthat normal liver function was successfully maintained in adult\nand child liver transplant recipients, with ∼20% of patients\n(6–63%) achieving complete immunosuppressive withdrawal\n(Tables 1, 2) (14–33).\nSanchez-Fueyo et al. of the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona\nconducted a prospective and multicenter IS withdrawal clinical\ntrial in 98 liver transplant recipients (NCT00647283). Of these,\n41 achieved clinical tolerance (41.8%) and 57 developed mild\nrejection (58.2%), which was followed by remission within 5.6\nmonths. During the 3-year follow-up after IS withdrawal, no\nsignificant histological damage was found in liver biopsies of the\ntolerant recipients. Statistical analysis showed that years post\ufffetransplantation correlated positively with tolerance induction\nand could be the strongest predictor (27).\nComparing with calcineurin inhibitors (CNI), sirolimus,\na kind of rapamycin inhibitor (mTOR-I), has no significant\ndrug toxicity, such as nephrotoxicity, hypertension, diabetes,\ninfections and neoplasms (34). Another advantage of sirolimus\nis its immunomodulatory ability that could facilitate safe IS\nwithdrawal (35). To assess if sirolimus could increase the\ntolerability in liver transplant recipients, Levitsky et al., at\nNorthwestern University, performed a prospective clinical trial\nof single sirolimus withdrawal (NCT02062944). They recruited\n15 recipients with non-viral or immunological hepatitis more\nthan 3 years after liver transplantation. After 12 months from\nsirolimus withdraw, it showed that 8 recipients (53%) achieved\nOT. Of the other 7 patients, 3 failed IS withdrawal, 3 developed\nmoderate cellular rejection (TCMR) on liver biopsies at the end\nof the study, and 1 was withdrawn from the trial owing to\nadrenal metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (32). The current\nresult showed the OT rate of sirolimus was comparable to CNI\ufffewithdrawal studies. Except for free CNI toxicity, whether liver\nrecipients can benefit more from sirolimus withdrawal, it still\nneeds more and larger trials.\nFor pediatric liver transplant recipients, Feng et al. in the\nUniversity of California conducted a multicenter, prospective\nclinical trial of IS withdrawal (WISP-R, NCT00320606). A total\nof 12 (60%) of the 20 enrolled pediatric recipients achieved\nclinical tolerance, and during follow-up for more than 2 years\nafter IS withdrawal, the graft function was normal and there\nwas no significant change in biopsy compared with baseline.\nA total of 3 recipients underwent acute rejection (n = 2) or\nuncertain rejection (n = 1) during IS withdrawal, and 4 recipients\nfailed to achieve clinical tolerance owing to uncertain acute\nrejection within 1 year of drug withdrawal.

Another\nrecipient was withdrawn from the study after IS withdrawal for\nviolating exclusion criteria. Similar to the results of the adult\nstudy, the time after transplantation was significantly longer in\nthe tolerance group than in the non-tolerance group, suggesting\nthat the time after transplantation is an important predictor of\ntolerance formation (26). Of 12 OT recipients followed for 5\nyears, 9 cases were positive for class I or class II DSA, but no cases\nresulted in chronic rejection, graft loss, or death. According to the\ngraft biopsy, there was no progressive increase in inflammation\nor fibrosis, suggesting that liver grafts after immune retreat can\nmaintain stability during a certain period of time (30).\nThere are also many studies focused on biomarkers that can\npredict immune tolerance. Bohne, et al. found that recipients\nwith spontaneous tolerance show an increased number of natural\nkiller (NK) cells and γδT cells in peripheral blood. High levels of\nhepcidin in liver tissues and ferritin in the serum, increased iron\ndeposits in hepatocytes, and high expression of the related liver\ntissue genes can accurately predict the outcome for a group of\nindependent patients with IS withdrawal (36). Mazariegos et al.\nshowed that the ratio of monocytoid dendritic cells (mDC) and\nplasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) precursors in the peripheral\nblood of patients with tolerance increased significantly compared\nto the healthy control group and the IS maintenance group\n(37). Levitsky et al. also found that, compared with the baseline,\nthe tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDC), regulatory B cells (Breg),\nand cell phenotypes associated with chronic antigen presentation\nin peripheral blood of the OT group was significantly higher\nthan that of the non-OT group. In addition, gene signatures\nin peripheral blood/biopsy tissue showed that 12/14 LTR could\naccurately predict tolerance (32). Chruscinski et al. performed\na clinical trial (NCT02541916) for the predictive value of gene\nsignatures in peripheral blood/biopsy tissue. Preliminary results\nsuggest that 5 of the 9 patients, consistent with the inclusion\ncriteria, had discontinued IS for more than 2 years (38). However,\nthe feasibility of this method still needs to be verified by adequate\nprospective, multicenter, large-scale follow-up trials.\nLong-term studies on the safety of immunosuppressive IS\nwithdrawal regimens are inconclusive, and most of them lack\nevidence of invasive liver biopsy. However, direct comparisons\nof these trials are difficult because of the lack of standardization.\nAccording to the current research results, the acute rejection rate\nafter IS withdrawal varies from 12 to 76% (Tables 1, 2), but it is\ngenerally moderate and almost reversible. Chronic rejection is\nrare (0–6%), and the incidence of graft loss owing to rejection\nis extremely low (39, 40). Over time, however, the prevalence\nand severity of chronic graft injury such as subclinical rejection,\nchronic portal inflammation, borderline hepatitis, and/or fibrosis\n(periportal and/or perivenous) would increase (41–51). Ten years\nafter transplantation, most studies report that normal histology\nis present in up to 30% of allografts; bridging fibrosis and/or\ncirrhosis may be equally common, accounting for about 60%\n(42, 45, 52). The transcriptome analysis of liver tissue revealed\nan expression profile very similar to that of T-cell mediated\nrejection (53). Notably, more than 90 percent of patients who\nstopped IS 20 years after the transplant did not experience\nrejection (27). To date, there is no definitive data suggesting that\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 4 June 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1326\n\nDu et al. Liver Transplant Tolerance\nprogressively abnormal histology leads to loss of liver graft or\ndeath of recipient. However, the OT is not a permanent stable\nstate, still needed regular inspection and to deal with in time.\nBecause of the difficulty to conduct prospective, multicenter,\nand longitudinal long-term studies on clinical transplant\ntolerance, the risk of IS withdrawal in liver transplant\nrecipients remains uncertain. However, based upon a broad\nunderstanding of liver disease, increased fibrosis in the allograft\nindicates the development of portal hypertension and associated\ncomplications. IS withdrawal alone could make recipients at\nthe risk of re-transplantation after some years, especially for\npediatric recipients. Therefore, there is a wide area of research\nfor the development of induced liver tolerance, especially with\ncell therapies.\nHEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL\nTRANSPLANTATION (HSCT) FOR THE\nINDUCTION OF LIVER TRANSPLANTATION\nTOLERANCE\nMixed hematopoietic chimerism is associated with alloantigen\ntolerance, a phenomenon first identified by Owen in freemartin\ncattle (fraternal twins sharing placental circulation retain\nallogeneic tolerance to each other after birth) in 1945\n(54). Subsequently, Kashiwagi and Starzl discovered donor\nimmunoglobulin in the peripheral blood of liver recipients\nin 1969, proposing the concept of chimerism in human\ntransplantation (55).\nIn a series of pioneering studies that began in 1961, Till\nand McCulloch demonstrated that bone marrow consists of a\ngroup of cells, known as hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which\nhave the ability to self-renew and differentiate into multiple\nmyeloid cell types (56–58). Afterward, Starzl et al. observed\npersistent multilineage hematopoietic microchimera (defined as\n<1% donor cells) in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues\nof long-lived liver or kidney transplant recipients, including\npatients on IS for many years after transplantation in 1993 (59).\nOver the past 30 years, many researchers have been exploring\nways to induce tolerance of solid organ transplantation (SOT)\nusing HSCT. Both autologous and allogeneic HSCT have been\napplied to induce transplant tolerance clinically (60–63).\nClinically, hematopoietic stem cells were first harvested from\nthe bone marrow of the ilium (64). In the 1990s, the protocol to\nmobilize stem cells into peripheral circulation with granulocyte\ncolony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and isolate from PBMC by\nmagnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) or flow sorting, thereby\nseparating CD34+ cells, greatly amplified the clinical application\nof HSCT. Subsequent studies show that combination with\nchemokine receptor 4 antagonist (AMD3100) and G-CSF can\nmobilize stem cells more effectively (65).\nAllogeneic HSCT Inducing Chimerism\nAfter lymphoablation of the recipient, transfusion of allogeneic\ndonor bone marrow can lead to mixed hematopoietic chimerism,\nwhere genetically different donor HSCs are implanted into\nthe host and differentiate into donor-derived lymphocytes that\ncoexist with the host. Central tolerance is a key mechanism\nof allograft tolerance induced by long-term HSCs (66). When\ndonor bone marrow is injected into the host that has undergone\nlymphoablation, such as total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) and\nanti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), HSCs are implanted into the\nrecipient bone marrow and thymus for differentiation, and the\nhost immune system is repopulated with various lymphocyte\ncells from the donor following by the immunoreconstitution.\nThe presence of donor progenitor cells in the thymus leads\nto the apoptosis of T cells that recognize the donor antigen\nexpressed by the transplanted organ itself without developing\nand donor-reactive T cells would undergo clonal deletion, so\nthe host can tolerate the allograft (67). The coexistence of host\nand donor hematopoietic cells is called chimera, and it is this\nchimera state in the host that drives central tolerance. According\nto the percentage of hematopoietic cells of donor origin, the\nchimerism was divided into microchimerism (donor <1%) and\ntwo forms of macrochimerism: full chimerism (donor ∼100%)\nand mixed chimerism (donor >1% but <100%) (68). Although\ncentral tolerance is the primary mechanism for HSCs-induced\ntolerance to homo-antigens, it may be incomplete, in part because\nnot all donor antigens are expressed by HSCs in the host thymus.\nFurthermore, T lymphocytes with low affinity for their own\nantigens may escape the selection process, thereby entering the\nperipheral lymphocyte cycle. In fact, peripheral mechanisms are\nneeded to maintain immune tolerance when the self-reactive\nT cell subsets evade the thymus selection process. In the\ntransplant environment, a mild pre-treatment regimen designed\nto induce chimerism can also control the survival of mature\nalloreactive T cells through peripheral regulation mechanisms,\nresulting in clone deletion, anergy, or apoptosis of the extra\ufffethymic alloreactive T lymphocytes (66, 67, 69–71). Persistent\nmicrochimerism may also be an important determinant for long\ufffeterm graft survival and transplant tolerance (72, 73).\nSince the mid-twentieth century, scientists have used HSC\ntransfusion by injecting donor bone marrow to alter host\nimmune responses in a variety of autoimmunity diseases and\nsolid organ transplantation (SOT) (74, 75). The ideal state of\nclinical transplant tolerance is to combine HSCT with SOT\nfrom the same donor to form a stable hematopoietic chimera\nof donor and recipient (76). However, myeloablative therapy\ncarries significant risks, most notably graft vs. host disease\n(GVHD) and severe infections, which are too high-risk to be\napplied in liver transplants routinely. Therefore, researchers\ninvestigated protocols for non-myeloablative bone marrow\ntransplant, including co-stimulatory molecules blockade, low\ndose irradiation, T cell depletion by monoclonal antibody,\netc. (77–79). Chimerism has always been the main method of\ninducing tolerance in renal transplantation. Clinical studies on\ntransplant tolerance induced by bone marrow chimerism in\nrenal allografts have also achieved gratifying results. In 2008,\nKawai et al. reported the first successful application of mixed\nchimerism tolerance in human kidney transplantation without\nlong-term maintenance of IS (80). The authors then reported that\n5 out of 10 kidney recipients had achieved transplant tolerance.\nAlthough the detectable duration of chimerism was transient,\nit was observed that donor-specific mixed lymphocyte response\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 5 June 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1326\n\nDu et al. Liver Transplant Tolerance\n(MLR) and CTL activity decreased in vitro and FOXP3 mRNA\nlevel increased in vivo (81). Based on the enriching of HSC with\ntolerogenic CD8+/TCR− facilitating cells (FC) and the depleting\nof GVHD-producing cells, Leventhal et al. performed a clinical\ntrial in 19 patients with uremia undergoing combined HLA\ufffemismatched hematopoietic stem cell/kidney transplantation.\nThen 12 of them achieved stable chimerism and OT status of\n8–48 months without GVHD after IS withdraw (82). Scandling\net al. reported that 16 of 22 HLA-matched patients who had\nreceived the same treatment regimen established a persistent\nmixed chimera (>12 months), with successful withdrawal from\nimmunosuppressants. Renal graft function was stable for up to 7\nyears after withdrawal, and no incidence of GVHD or rejection\nwas observed (83).\nIn the field of liver transplantation, there have been some\ncase reports and clinical trials with HSCT transfusion. Ringden\net al. reported a liver cancer patient who received HSCT from the\nsame donor after liver transplantation, underwent preoperative\nmyeloablation, achieved chimerism, but subsequently died of\nopportunistic infection (84). Donckier et al. recruited 5 patients\nwith advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent\nliving liver transplantation and received donor CD34+ stem\ncell transfusion based on the induction regimen of non\ufffemyeloablative therapy. Two patients successfully stopped IS\nwithout allograft rejection. Three patients developed acute\ncellular rejection after immunosuppressant withdrawal, two of\nwhich were given steroid pulse therapy, whereas the other was\nreintroduced to calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) immunosuppressive\ntherapy, with no observation of macrochimerism (85, 86).\nTryphonopoulos et al. recruited 45 adults who received\ncadaver livers and subsequently underwent transfusion of donor\nbone marrow cells on the day of the transplant. IS were\ndiscontinued for more than 3 years, starting 3 years after\nsurgery. Acute rejection occurred in 69% of the treated patients,\nand immunosuppressive therapy was successfully withdrawn\nin 22.2% of the treated recipients. However, there was no\nsignificant increase in the success of withdrawal and chimerism\nlevels, compared to patients who did not receive bone marrow\ntransplants (20). Liver transplantation is mainly performed from\ncadaver donors, and recipients generally suffer from severe\ndiseases during the perioperative period, as well as postoperative\ncoagulation and circulatory dysfunction, which may lead to\nserious infection and tumor recurrence.\nSurprisingly, Alexander et al. reported a successful case that\na 9-year-old girl with type O, RhD negative underwent RhD\nblood type conversion to positive after receiving the liver graft\nof a male donor with type O, RhD positive. Furthermore, CD19\n+ B cells (XY) were found in the sample of bone marrow\npuncture. Peripheral blood lymphocyte analysis showed that\n94% of T cells came from male and 6% from female; 98% of\nthe B cells came from male and 2% from female; 100% of\nthe granulocytes and NK cells came from male. These results\nsupport the formation of chimera. When IS was withdrawn 14\nmonths after transplantation, both the graft and the recipient\nwere healthy for 5 years without GVHD or acute rejection. This\nindicates that fully tolerated chimera can still occur under certain\nconditions (87).\nFor the application of allogeneic HSCT in liver transplant\ntolerance and chimerism, there are some challenges to overcome,\ne.g., the risk of serious infection, coagulation and circulatory\ndysfunction following the myeloablative, the tumor recurrence\nand the permanence of existence in recipient.\nAutologous HSCT Inducing Chimerism\nAutologous HSCT is performed by pre-collecting and cryo\ufffepreserving autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem\ncells isolated from the patient and then re-transfusing after\nmyeloablative treatment to reconstruct the immune system,\nwhich could lead to a more tolerant immune system (88, 89).\nIn autologous stem cell transplantation, the cells come from the\nrecipient, which theoretically prevents the possibility of immune\nrejection or GVHD. Moreover, autologous bone marrow or\nperipheral stem cells are easier to obtain and store.\nAlthough there are some differences between allogeneic and\nautologous HSCT with regard to tolerance mechanisms, they\nboth attempt to reconstruct the recipient immune system and\nachieve immune tolerance through “re-education.” The basic\nprinciple of autologous HSCT is to first eliminate reactive and\nmemory immunity and then regenerate the immune system;\nthat is, to exhaust autoreactive and memory T and B cells\nthrough a myeloablative or non-myeloablative regimen, followed\nby reconstruction of immune tolerance (89, 90). The immune\nmonitoring analyses have shown that this can recreate new\nauto-tolerant immune T and B cell banks, enhance immune\nregulation mechanisms, and induce changes in the recipient’s\nanti-inflammatory environment (63, 91–95). Muraro et al. found\na large number of new T cell clones emerged after autologous\nHSCT in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), substituting for\nthe original T cell receptor (TCR) bank and showing a greater\ndiversity of TCR spectrum (63). The immune cell gene expression\nprofiles showed that the number of CD3 + cells remained low\nafter autologous HSCT, and the number of CD8 + cells could\nreturn to normal after 3 months postoperatively (92). Another\nimportant phenotypic observation is that the recipient’s CD4 +\nCD25 + FoxP3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) were significantly\nincreased (96–98) and so were the CD8 + Foxp3 + Tregs (99),\ncompared to the preoperative state. The ratio of Bregs increased\nbriefly after autologous HSCT and remained at a higher level for\nat least 2 years after transplantation, suggesting that Bregs may\nbe involved in the reconstruction of self-tolerance after AHSCT\n(95, 100). In addition, a variety of cells, such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL\ufffe8, IL-10, IL-17, IL-18, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and TGF-β play an essential\nrole in immune reconstruction and regulation (95, 97).\nIn recent years, autologous HSCT has been used in clinical\ntrials to eliminate various types of refractory autoimmune\ndiseases such as multiple sclerosis, systemic sclerosis (SSc),\nsystemic lupus erythematous (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA),\nCrohn’s disease, juvenile arthritis, and type 1 diabetes (T1D),\npresenting better results than traditional therapies and showing\npromising prospects for long-term remission of autoimmune\ndiseases without IS (90, 93, 95, 101–105). At present, autologous\nHSCT has also been widely used in various types of liver\ncirrhosis, improving liver function in varying degrees (106–109).\nCoupled with the study of transplant animal models, these studies\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 6 June 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1326\n\nDu et al. Liver Transplant Tolerance\nprovide abundant theoretical basis for expanding autologous\nHSCT application in organ transplantation (110–112).\nIn Toronto University (Canada), Levy et al. have performed a\nclinical trial on autologous HSCT for allogeneic organ transplant\ntolerance (ASCOTT) (NCT02549586) (38). Six liver transplant\nrecipients were recruited, five of whom were enrolled. The\nHSCs of patients were mobilized, purified, and cryopreserved\nahead of liver transplant. After immune ablation (Busulfan\n+ Cyclophosphamide + rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin), the\npatients received autologous HSCT and liver transplantation.\nIS was withdrawn in five patients with evidence of deletion of\nalloreactive T cell clones. Two of them were still healthy at 406\nand 518 days after HSCT; one died of heart failure at 212 days,\none patient received re-transplantation at 166 days after HSCT\nowing to complications of venous occlusive disease, and one\npatient died of erythrocytic syndrome at 87 days after HSCT.\nHowever, non-hematological toxicity in grades 3–4 was found\nin almost all patients. It is suggested that there is a certain\napplication prospect of HSCT-induced immune tolerance after\nliver transplantation, but the potential toxicity is an important\nproblem to be solved.\nCD4 + REGULATORY T CELLS IN LIVER\nTRANSPLANT TOLERANCE\nUnder physiological conditions, Tregs account for 5–10% of\nCD4 + T cells in peripheral blood. Tregs are characterized by\nhigh stable expression of CD25 and FoxP3, and are divided into\nnatural regulatory T cells (nTreg) produced in the thymus and\nperipherally induced regulatory T cells (iTreg) (113). Modern\nresearch shows that CD4 + Treg is the key to control self\ufffetolerance. The combination can induce peripheral tolerance to\nautoantigens and alloantigens through a variety of mechanisms,\nmainly cell-to-cell contact-induced cell lysis, local depletion of\nIL-2, inhibition of DC maturity, downregulation of DC function,\nsecretion of immunosuppressive cytokines (such as IL-10, IL-35,\nand TGF-β), etc. (114). In addition, Tregs can migrate to the\ninflammation site, and their inhibitory activity is usually located\nin the inflammation site, without significant effects on overall\nimmunity (115).\nIn rodent models of liver transplantation tolerance, Tregs\nare present in increased proportion in liver grafts and are\ninvolved in the induction of liver tolerance (116, 117). Relevant\nclinical studies have also shown that, in OT liver transplantation\nrecipients, the proportion of Tregs in peripheral blood and liver\nincreases, which shows a protective effect on liver allografts (118,\n119). Therefore, the use of Tregs to mediate transplant tolerance\nis an important part of transplant immunology research.\nTreg adoptive infusion is a method to induce tolerance,\nwhere the principle is to tilt the immune response toward Treg\ndominance, rather than to cause rejection of T effector cells, in\norder to reduce the dependence of patients receiving solid organ\ntransplantation on immunosuppressant drugs.\nIt is now generally accepted that the best method to make\nTreg clinically is to effectively expand it in vitro and maintain\nhigh purity and inhibitory activity (115). Under certain culture\nconditions, human Treg can be expanded to 100–1,000 times in\n2 weeks (120, 121). The required cell dose varies depending on\nthe type of disease and the presence or absence of combination\ntherapy (115, 122, 123). Treg separation and purification\nmethods mainly include MACS and flow cytometry sorting.\nSome researchers have used the chimeric antigen receptor\n(CAR) technology to produce donor antigen-specific Treg\n(CAR-Treg) and can overcome the limitation of alloantigen\ufffestimulation-based protocolsin vitro. In these studies, CARs could\nbe developed to redirect Tregs toward a specific donor leucocyte\nantigen (HLA) class I molecule (HLA-A2). Unlike HLA class\nII, the selected donor HLA class I is expressed ubiquitously in\ngrafts. Compared with polyclonal Tregs, CAR-Treg could have\nbetter safety, stability, and effectiveness in theory and have strong\ntherapeutic potential to protect allograft (124–127).\nClinical trials of various autoimmune diseases and GVHD\nhave confirmed the safety and feasibility of adoptive Treg\ninfusions (128–131). Clinical reports of adoptive infusion of Treg\nin kidney transplant recipients have demonstrated the safety of\nthis method in solid organ transplantation, and, through the\nmethod of isotope plutonium labeling (3H), it has been found\nthat Tregs can still be detectable for up to 1 year after infusion\n(132, 133).\nCurrently, multiple transplant centers around the world are\nconducting clinical trials of liver transplantation Treg treatment.\nTodo et al. from the Hokkaido University in Japan, studied\n10 liver transplant recipients who received a single dose of\ndonor antigen-specific Treg. Tregs from recipient lymphocytes\nwere amplified by co-culture with irradiated donor cells in the\npresence of anti-CD80/86 monoclonal antibodies in vitro for 2\nweeks. CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + Tregs were amplified 3–6-fold\nto 28.1% of CD4 + cells and still maintained inhibitory activity.\nOn the 13th day after the operation, the cells were infused back to\nthe recipient with 0.23∼6.37 × 106\ncell/Kg intravenously. IS was\ngradually reduced during 6 months and withdrawn 18 months\npostoperatively. These recipients were subjected to rigorous\nmonitoring, including liver biopsies, T cell activity assessments,\nand level of donor-specific antibodies. After 16 to 33 months\nof follow-up, 7 patients achieved OT without rejection and 4\nremained IS-free for 24 months. Mild rejection occurred in 3\npatients, and low dose IS was maintained afterward (121).\nSafinia et al., at London University (UK), performed a\ncombined I/IIa clinical trial ThRIL (NCT02166177) for the\napplication of Treg immunotherapy in the field of liver\ntransplantation. Tregs were isolated from liver transplant\nrecipients by Good manufacturing practice (GMP) separation\ntechnology based on CliniMACS sorting. IL-2 and rapamycin\nwere used for Tregs expansion in vitro. A stable Treg population\n(purity of CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 + > 95%) can be\nobtained in 36 days, reaching a sufficient number for its clinical\napplication (120). With stimulation by rapamycin, the amplified\nTregs could maintain high levels of FOXP3, CD127lo, and\nCTLA4, and, with continued expression of CD62L and CXCR3,\nensure the stability and functionality of Treg amplification,\nwhich could prevent Treg from transforming into Th17 cells\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 7 June 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1326\n\nDu et al. Liver Transplant Tolerance\nin the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines (134). Nine\nliver transplant recipients have received autologous polyclonal\nTreg infusions, showing that the procedure is safe, does not\nincrease the incidence of infection or cancer, and can temporarily\nincrease circulating Treg pools and reduce anti-donor T cell\nreaction (135).\nThe current research has opened the door for adoptive\ninfusion of Treg in liver transplantation induction therapy,\nshowing good application prospects. Subsequent research may\nneed to focus on isolation purity, functional induction, CAR\ufffeTreg, and clinical induction protocols for OT of Treg in vitro.\nREGULATORY DENDRITIC CELLS IN\nLIVER TRANSPLANT TOLERANCE\nIn 1973, Steinman et al. found a cell type with a “star shape,”\nor dendritic morphology, found in the preparation of adherent\nspleen cells and named dendritic cell (DC) (136). It has been\nrecognized that DCs are a group of highly heterogeneous cell\npopulations derived from the myeloid or lymphoid, which\nare widely distributed in all tissues and organs and are the\nmost powerful APC in the body, regulating both innate and\nadaptive immunity and playing an important role in promoting\nself-tolerance in healthy homeostasis (137, 138). In humans,\naccording to their cell morphology and function, DCs are divided\ninto two mean lineages of CD11c + conventional DCs (cDCs)\n(HLA-DR + CD11c +) and CD11c- plasmocyte-like DCs (pDCs)\n(HLA-DR + CD123 +) (139).\nIn 1996, Steptoe and Thomson defined the DC population that\ncan induce immune tolerance in vivo as tolerogenic DC (tolDC)\n(140). However, it is still unclear whether tolDCs constitute a\nparticular lineage or just reflect a specific activation state of\nDCs (141). In 2003, Sato et al. named the tolerogenic DCs\nthey cultured in vitro as ""regulatory DCs (regDC),” because\nthey had the ability to inhibit T cell activation, induce T cell\nanergy, and induce Tregs. They could also maintain strong\nimmunoregulatory properties in inflammatory conditions and\nhave the potential to resist multiple immune diseases (142,\n143). This nomenclature has also been widely used in classic\ntolerogenic DCs and their derivatives (144–148). Currently, two\nmethods of naming such tolerant DCs are both widely used.\nOver the past 20 years, a large number of studies have found\nthat regDCs could be used to treat various autoimmune diseases\nin animal models, such as T1D, SSc, RA, Cohn’s Disease, etc.\n(149–152), and to induce tolerance of in GVHD and allografts\n(115, 143, 153, 154). They also have good clinical application\nprospects in the field of liver transplant tolerance (139, 155).\nThe phenotypic characteristics of regDC include low\nexpression of MHC class I and II molecules and T cell co\ufffestimulatory molecules (CD80/B7.1, CD86/B7.2, CD40, OX40L),\nT cell co-inhibition of ligands (such as programmed death\nLigand 1 PD-L1), high expression of death-inducing ligands\n(FasL), and low expression of adhesion molecules (156, 157).\nUnlike immature DCs, there are indications that tolerability of\nregDCs is the result of a specific transcription program, rather\nthan the preservation of immature status (158).\nRegDCs retain the ability to present antigens to specific\nT cells, and they can also build up peripheral tolerance\nthrough different immunoregulatory mechanisms. These related\npromotion mechanisms include the following:\n• T cell anergy and T cell clonal deletion (159, 160);\n• Apoptosis in naive and memory T cells through\nincreased expression of Fas (CD95)/FasL and indoleamine\n2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) (161, 162);\n• Inducing and expanding regulatory lymphocytes, including\nTregs (163, 164) and Bregs (165);\n• Producing double negative (CD3 [+] CD4 [−] CD8 [−]) T\ncells (166);\n• Development of tolerance by increasing the expression and\nrelease of immune regulatory molecules, such as the anti\ufffeinflammatory cytokines IL-10, TGF-b, NO, and HO-1 (167–\n170), the apoptosis-inducing PD-L 1, PD-L2, and human\nleukocytes Ag-G (HLA-G), and the tumor necrosis factor\n(TNF) (161, 164, 171, 172).\nRecent studies have shown that exosomes released by regDCs are\nalso involved in the induction and maintenance of peripheral T\ncell tolerance (172–174).\nAlthough DCs are widely distributed in tissues, their\nproportion is very low. Immature DCs (imDCs) are tolerogenic\nin the body, but they are also unstable and may differentiate\ninto immunogenic DCs in inflammatory conditions. Therefore,\nit is very important to establish a mature system for regDC\nculture in vitro to obtain a sufficient number of functional and\nstable regDCs.\nDCs in the immune system act as “immune checkpoints,” with\nthe key role of turning immune signals on or off. A large number\nof anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive mediators can\npromote tolerogenic phenotypes by interfering with DC\ndifferentiation or activating checkpoints (157). Researchers\nhave explored different strategies for generating stable regDCs,\nsome of which have been performed in clinical trials, but\na consensus hasn’t been reached on the best approach\nyet (115, 157, 172, 175, 176).\nCurrently, regDCs in vitro are mainly derived from rodent\nbone marrow cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear\ncells, as it is easier and less invasive than to operate in humans,\nand abundant DC precursors are also available. Granulocyte\ufffemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) ± IL-4 can\nbe added to fresh or frozen blood mononuclear cells or\ntheir precursors to promote the differentiation of myeloid\ntolDCs (143, 175). Then, one or more anti-inflammatory and\nimmunosuppressive agents should also be added to inhibit\ntheir maturation and promote tolerance. These agents include\nanti-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-10, TGF-β, TNF-α),\nanti-inflammatory/IS drugs (CNI, rapamycin, mycophenolate,\ncorticosteroids, or aspirin), Vitamin D3, Prostaglandin E2,\nretinoids, and HLA-G, tissue factors, such as hepatocyte growth\nfactor (HGF) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), etc. (139,\n143, 153, 177–180).\nIn rodent and non-human primate transplantation models,\nadoptive infusion of DCreg prior to transplantation can prolong\nthe survival of allografts and promote specific tolerance to\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 8 June 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1326\n\nDu et al. Liver Transplant Tolerance\nthe graft either alone, or in combination with short-term\nIS (144, 154, 181–183). Clinical trials on the safety and\neffectiveness of regDC have been conducted for a variety of\nautoimmune diseases, including T1D, RA, multiple sclerosis\n(MS), Crohn’s Disease (184–188) (NCT02618902, NCT02903537,\nNCT01352858, NCT00445913), and renal transplant rejection\n(137) (NCT 0364265, NCT02252055). So far, although there\nare no long-term results, it has been confirmed that a regDC\nregimen is safe and feasible without significant side effects, and\nthat the patient’s compliance is good. These results provide a\ngood theoretical guide for a regDC therapeutic schedule for\nliver transplantation.\nIn Pittsburgh University (USA), Thomson et al. performed a\nsingle-center, phase I/II clinical trial on regDC in living donor\nliver transplantation (NCT03164265). The study recruited low\uffferisk living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) recipients, isolated\nmonocytes from peripheral blood from potential living organ\ndonors, and cultured cells with GM-CSF, IL-4, VitD3, and IL\ufffe10 for 7 days in vitro. GMP-grade donor-derived regDCs could\nbe induced (153, 189), and a single intravenous infusion of 2.5–\n10 × 10 6 donor-derived regDCs/kg was administered 7 days\nbefore the surgery. Meanwhile, half a dose of mycophenolic\nacid (MPA) was given, without ATG or Ab. MPA and Tac\nwere administrated within 6 months after transplantation. At\n6 months after transplantation, recipients who meet specific\ncriteria [non-rejection and liver function allowance tests (LFTs)]\nmay gradually discontinue MPA. TAC withdrawal assessments\nare performed 1 year after transplantation and then discontinued\ngradually to achieve complete IS withdrawal 18 months after\nliver transplantation. The recipients will be followed up for 3\nyears from IS withdrawal. During the follow-up period, clinical\ndata and peripheral blood were regularly collected and analyzed\nto evaluate changes in liver function, renal function, donor\ufffespecific antigen (DSA) levels, cardiovascular risk factors, and\nquality of life. Meanwhile, liver biopsy is to be performed after\n1 and 3 years from the withdrawal of IS (146). This study\nis still in the research stage, but we are looking forward to\nthe results.\nAutologous DCs seem to be more feasible than donor-derived\nDCs, especially for liver transplantation from deceased donors, as\nit can avoid the risk of sensitization. Autologous regDC infusion\nwith or without donor antigen pulse has shown good tolerogenic\neffects in animal transplant model studies (179, 190). Some\nstudies have shown that autologous tolDC is more effective than\ndonor DC in delayed transplant rejection (180, 191). Under the\nleadership of the European Union, in Nantes University (France),\nMoreau A. et al. conducted a Phase I/II (feasibility/safety) “one\nstudy” (www. onestudy.org) on kidney transplant recipients with\nautologous tolDCs infusion (NCT0225055) (192), and its clinical\neffects are still being observed.\nThere are few clinical trials about regDC in the induction\nof liver transplantation tolerance, and still in the observation\nstage up to now. As a kind of powerful immune-regulating cell,\nthe prospect of regDC is still thrilling in liver transplantation\ntolerance. For the successful conversion from preclinical\nresearches to clinical application, researches still have\nmany issues to be studied extensively, such as the further\noptimization of the regDC induction scheme to extend its\nhalf-life, the stability of immunomodulatory function, and the\nadministration scheme of IS. However, the further exploration\nof methods to induce immune tolerance will also improve our\nunderstanding of the biological characteristics of DC and the\nmechanisms of tolerance.\nSUMMARY AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT\nImmune tolerance has always been the “holy grail” in the field\nof organ transplantation. On the basis of a large number of\npreclinical studies, various cell therapies could hold promising\nprospects for inducing liver tolerance. This article reviews the\nrelated research and progress regarding spontaneous tolerance\nand the HSCT, Tregs, and regDCs strategies in the field of\nliver transplant tolerance. There are many other cells not\nreviewed that may also have the potential to induce liver\ntransplant tolerance, such as mesenchymal stem cells, regulatory\nmacrophages, regulatory B cells, and bone marrow-derived\nimmunosuppressive cells. At present, the clinical trials of various\ncell therapies are still in the early stages, and most of them are\nsingle-center studies. Thus, there is no clear clinical effect, the\npurity and stability of cell-induced therapy and its safety for long\ufffeterm recipients should still be explored for a long time, as many\nissues need to be observed.\nThe immune system is extremely delicate and complex. It may\nbe difficult to achieve immune tolerance using only one type of\ntolerant cell or one mechanism. It may be necessary to consider\ndifferent mechanisms in combination with different immune\ncells or drugs. The development of immunologic surveillance and\ntolerance markers is also critical. This could develop personalized\ntolerance induction programs for transplant recipients and could\nguide the timing of immunosuppressive drug withdrawal or early\ndetection of rejection, infection, or tumors.\nWith the in-depth development of multi-field, multi\ufffedisciplinary, and multi-level research, the application of various\nnew experimental methods can provide more possibilities and\ntheoretical guidance for liver transplant tolerance. With the\ndevelopment of multi-center clinical trials, we are optimistic\nabout the good prospects for liver transplant tolerance.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nZC devised this topic.

The spread of obesity\nworldwide in pandemic proportions has led to a rapid rise of\nNAFLD in developed and developing countries alike. There are\nno approved pharmacological agents to treat steatohepatitis\nor advanced fibrosis but obeticholic acid recently has shown\nsome promise in phase III trial. Currently, NAFLD is the\nnumber one etiology for simultaneous liver and kidney trans\ufffeplantation in the USA, second most common indication for\nliver transplantation (LT) and projected to become number\none very soon. LT for NAFLD poses unique challenges, as\nthese patients are generally older, obese and more likely to\nhave a number of metabolic risk factors. Bariatric surgery is\nan option and can be considered if a structured weight loss\nprogram does not achieve the sustained weight loss goal.\nComprehensive cardiovascular risk assessment and aggres\ufffesive management of comorbid conditions are crucial in the LT\nevaluation process to improve post-transplant survival. Re\ufffecurrent nonalcoholic steatohepatitis after LT is not uncom\ufffemon, and thus warrants primary and secondary prevention\nstrategies through a multidisciplinary approach. Prevalence of\nNAFLD in a donor population is a unique and growing concern\nthat limits the access to quality liver grafts.\nCitation of this article: Gadiparthi C, Spatz M, Greenberg S,\nIqbal U, Kanna S, Satapathy SK, et al.

Today, NAFLD\nis a major global health problem and has emerged as the 2nd\nmost common indication for liver transplantation (LT) in the\nUSA, and is projected to become number one soon.1 NAFLD is\na spectrum of liver disease that includes two major types:\nnonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), when there is steatosis, and\nnonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), when there is significant\ninflammation. Because of sedentary lifestyle and poor dietary\nhabits, combined with advancing age, prevalence of NAFL and\nits progression to NASH cirrhosis, liver failure, and HCC, and\nultimately the need for LT, are continuing to rise.\nWhile LT is curative and has been shown to improve\nsurvival of patients with advanced liver disease of any\netiology, there are unique challenges in NASH patients.\nFirst, there is no effective pharmacotherapy currently avail\ufffeable to halt progression of NASH to advanced fibrosis stages,\nunlike viral hepatitis. Second, NASH patients are often older,\nobese and have numerous comorbidities compared to those\nwith other chronic liver disease (CLD) etiologies, thus increas\ufffeing the risk of mortality during and after LT. Third, increased\nprevalence of NAFLD in the donor population may adversely\naffect the availability and quality of liver grafts in future.\nFinally, recurrent NASH after LT in recipients can negatively\naffect graft and patient survival. In this evolving landscape,\nthe purpose of this review is to discuss the burden of NAFLD,\nits risk factors, and its implications on LT.\nEpidemiology of NAFLD\nAs noted previously, due to the growing obesity epidemic now\naffecting more than 1.9 billion adults globally, NAFLD has\nbecome one of the leading causes of CLD.2 According to\nrecent estimates, NAFLD affects as many as one billion indi\ufffeviduals throughout the world. Similarly, in the USA, NAFLD\naffects nearly 80-100 million individuals, making it the\nnumber one etiology of CLD.3 Nearly 25% of patients with\nJournal of Clinical and Translational Hepatology 2020 vol. 8 | 215–221 215\nCopyright: © 2020 Authors.

Although the preva\ufffelence of NAFLD is increasing throughout the world, there\nappears to be a significant geographical variation. Overall\nglobal prevalence of NAFLD is reported to be 25.2%, accord\ufffeing to a recent meta-analysis, with the highest rates being in\nthe Middle East (32%) and South America (31%) and the\nlowest in Africa (14%).4 The prevalence is 27% in Asia, fol\ufffelowed by 24% in North America, and 23% in Europe.\nThe prevalence of NASH in the general population is\nestimated to be in the range of 1.5% and 6.45%.2 However,\nthe true prevalence of NASH is difficult to ascertain, primarily\nbecause of inaccuracies of diagnostic modalities used. Ultra\ufffesound fails to identify the mild form of liver steatosis; up to\n50-80% of patients with NAFLD may have normal liver\nenzymes, and the gold standard liver biopsy suffers consid\ufffeerable sampling error.5 Nevertheless, if the current trend con\ufffetinues, the future burden of NASH and its related\ncomplications are only going to rise astronomically. Novel\nmethodologies used in modeling studies have given a\nglimpse into future projections. For example, in a modeling\nstudy utilizing obesity (by body mass index) and incidence of\nT2DM in eight countries, involving approximately one-quarter\nof the world’s population, Estes and colleagues6 estimated a\nsignificant rise in NASH and related complications by 2030.\nSpecifically, they reported a 63% increase in NASH preva\ufffelence, 168% increase in incidence of decompensated NASH\ncirrhosis, 137% increase in hepatocellular carcinoma inci\ufffedence, and 178% increase in liver-related death, with\noverall number of deaths as high as 800,000. Figure 1 sum\ufffemarizes the natural history and progression of NAFL/NASH to\nrelated CLD, LT and recurrent NAFL/NASH.\nRisk factors of NAFLD\nIt is very well established that T2DM, obesity and related\nmetabolic syndrome (hyperlipidemia, increased waist circum\ufffeference, hypertension) play a major role in the pathogenesis\nof NAFLD. According to a large systematic review, involving\n222,816 diabetic patients from 25 countries, the NAFLD\nprevalence in T2DM patients is as high as 61.1%.7 Similarly,\nthe prevalence of NASH and advanced fibrosis ($F3) in biop\ufffesied diabetic patients was reported as 64% and 10.4%\nrespectively.7,8 NAFLD prevalence increases with increasing\nbody mass index8 and it is estimated that 95% of morbidly\nobese patients undergoing weight-loss surgery have NAFLD.9\nAs the rates of obesity amongst children have risen from\n5.0% in 1960 to 16.9% in 2010, NAFLD is increasingly diag\ufffenosed in children and adolescents.10\nAmong the non-modifiable risk factors, age, sex and\nethnicity are implicated in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. In\nthe USA, NAFLD is most prevalent in Hispanic Americans,\nfollowed by non-Hispanic Whites, and is least common in\nAfrican Americans.11 According to population studies, NAFLD\nis more common in males and prevalence increases with age.\nNAFLD also causes substantial economic impact due to health\ncare dollar spending. The 10-year burden of NAFLD is esti\ufffemated to reach more than 1 trillion dollars in the USA alone.\nIn Europe, the 10-year burden is expected to reach 334 billion\neuros.10\nNASH as an indication for LT\nAs already noted, NAFLD is now the most common cause of\nCLD in the USA and Europe and is continuing to rise world\ufffewide.10 Among the top indications for LT in the USA, based on\nthe United Network for Organ sharing (UNOS) data from\n2003-2014, NASH experienced the highest rate of increase\n(162%) compared to alcohol (55%) and hepatitis C virus\n(HCV) (33%).12 Subsequently in 2013, NASH became the\n2nd leading indication for LT in the USA.1 In the same year,\nthe advent of direct acting antiviral agents, a highly effective\nand safer type of medications, has led to dramatic reduction\nin chronic HCV disease burden and rates of LT. The decline of\nHCV prevalence, combined with recent resurgence of alcohol\ufffeism, has resulted in alcoholic liver disease (ALD) to become\nthe number one cause for LT in the USA, surpassing HCV.13\nHowever, this trend is not expected to last very long, as\nNASH, with its current trajectory, is expected to replace ALD\nand become the leading indication very soon.\nAlthough NASH patients undergoing LT are older and obese\ncompared to those with other etiologies, studies have dem\ufffeonstrated that the short-term and long-term post-transplant\nsurvival rates are very similar. For example, 1- and 3-year\npost-transplant survival rates for NASH LT recipients were\n84% and 78% compared to 87% and 78% (p=0.67) for other\nindications (HCV, ALD, and cholestatic and autoimmune hep\ufffeatitis). In addition, the 3-year graft survival rate was 76% for\nNASH LT recipients.14 In another study, the 5-year survival of\nLT recipients for NASH was superior to those with HCV\n(77.81% vs. 72.15%).12 More recently, in a retrospective\nstudy of 26,121 LT recipients with HCC from 2002-2016,\nNASH patients were older (mean age of 62.9 years) com\ufffepared to those with HCV (59.2 years), HBV (57.2 years) and\nALD (60.6 years), obese (body mass index of >30, NASH\n60.5% vs. HCV 32.9%, HBV 14.4% and ALD 40%) and\nmore likely to be diabetic (NASH 60.3% vs. HCV 22.5%,\nHBV 19.3% and ALD 32.7%). The 1-year post-transplant sur\ufffevival rate was similar across all cohorts (p>0.5) but long-term\nmortality and graft loss were highest in HCV and lowest in\nHBV.15\nAlthough HCV has remained as the most common cause of\nHCC in LT candidates, NASH was the most rapidly growing\ncause, with 11.8-fold increase from 2002 to 2016. Figures 2\nand 3 demonstrate the temporal trends of annual waitlist\nadditions and LT rates in the USA from 2008-2018 for the\ntop 5 etiologies of CLD based on the most recent UNOS\ndata. These graphs demonstrate a steady and upward trend\nfor NASH-related LT in the USA.\nFig. 1. Natural history of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic\nsteatohepatitis and recurrence after liver transplantation.\n216 Journal of Clinical and Translational Hepatology 2020 vol. 8 | 215–221\nGadiparthi C. et al: Liver transplantation in NASH patients\n\nStrategies to prevent progression of NAFL/NASH\nT2DM, insulin resistance, obesity and other metabolic risk\nfactors are the main factors driving the prevalence of NAFLD\nand remain the primary targets in its prevention and pro\ufffegression. Lifestyle modifications, such as exercise and a\nhealthy diet, resulting in sustained weight loss are the only\nproven and effective strategies available currently to curtail\nthe NAFL/NASH burden.2 NAFLD is considered to be the\nhepatic manifestation metabolic syndrome. Approximately\n70% of patients with T2DM have NAFLD and these diseases\nshare common pathophysiological pathways.\nAntidiabetic drugs, as well as statins, can improve bio\ufffechemical and histological features of NAFL/NASH.16 Manage\ufffement of comorbidities is not only critical in decreasing\nprogression of NASH but is also pivotal in decreasing cardio\ufffevascular mortality, which is the major cause of death in these\npatients. While weight loss is the single most effective inter\ufffevention, it can be extremely challenging for patients to\nachieve the sustained weight loss goal. Structured weight\nmanagement programs with a multidisciplinary team have\nhad variable success. In morbidly obese patients, who are\nless likely to be considered for LT surgery, bariatric surgery\nmay be necessary and has not shown to have any negative\nimpact on the LT outcomes.17 Additionally, bariatric surgery\nimproves and sometimes eliminates other comorbid condi\ufffetions in many patients and has shown to improve long-term\nsurvival from the two most common causes of death in\nNAFLD, malignancy and cardiovascular disease (CVD).18\nRecent advances in pharmacotherapy\nThe two primary endpoints of numerous ongoing clinical trials\nare resolution of steatohepatitis and improvement in liver\nfibrosis or both, which are considered surrogate markers for\nslowing the progression of NASH. Despite the vast knowledge\nof risk factors and clear elucidation of pathophysiologic path\ufffeways in NASH, there has been no significant breakthrough in\ndisease-specific pharmacotherapy yet. However, recent\nstudies have shown some promise. Obeticholic acid, which\nis already approved for primary biliary cholangitis, is currently\nunder review by the national Federal Drug Administration and\ncould potentially be the first approved medication for NASH.\nIn recent interim analysis of the REGENERATE trial, a phase\nIII multicenter, randomized placebo-controlled study, biopsy\ufffeproven NASH patients with F1-F3 fibrosis, treatment with\nobeticholic acid at 25 mg a day has reached the primary end\npoint of improvement in liver fibrosis score by $ 1 stage\nwithout worsening of NASH at 18 months follow-up compared\nto placebo (23% vs. 12%, p=0.0002).19\nA number of other agents, such as cenicriviroc, elafibranor,\naramchol and resmetirom, are in the pipeline with phase III\ntrials. Primary end points are fibrosis improvement and\nprevention of worsening of NASH for cenicriviroc and NASH\nresolution and prevention of progression fibrosis for elafibri\ufffenor.20 Elafibranor with its favorable safety profile and toler\ufffeability makes an attractive choice, but the phase III results of\nthe RESOLVE-IT trial are delayed. Cenicriviroc’s phase IIb\nresults were promising, but poor preliminary efficacy results\ncast doubt over the success of the ongoing AURORA phase III\ntrial.21 The strong safety and efficacy found in a phase II trial\nas well as in preliminary results of the phase III MAESTRO\ufffeNASH trial has made resmetirom a hopeful alternative.22\nFinally, early results of aramchol are inconsistent but phase\nIII trial is in progress.\nSpecial considerations of NASH in LT\nNASH is a multisystem disease associated, with clinical\nmanifestations beyond the liver. NASH patients are at higher\nrisk of mortality and morbidity due to increased prevalence of\nmetabolic comorbidities. Importantly, CVD and malignancies\ncontribute to higher mortality in NASH patients than liver\uffferelated morality (cirrhosis and HCC).23 These factors should\nbe considered in the LT evaluation process.\nCardiovascular risk assessment and management in LT\nNASH independently contributes to increased cardiovascular\nmortality and morbidity, regardless of other cardiovascular\nrisk factors. In addition to coronary artery disease, several\nother cardiovascular complications are reported in NAFLD\npatients, such as premature atherosclerosis to left ventricular\ndysfunction and hypertrophy, aortic sclerosis, congestive\nheart failure, and cardiac arrythmias (atrial fibrillation and\nprolonged QTc).24 Based on the recent meta-analysis by\nTargher et al.,\n25 including 34000 patients, presence of\nNAFLD is associated with 65% increase in fatal and non\ufffefatal cardiovascular events at medial 7-year follow-up\nperiod. LT surgery is inherently stressful to the heart\nbecause of sudden changes in hemodynamic parameters\nand furthermore, post-operative complications can unmask\nunderlying clinically silent CVD leading to poor outcomes\nand increased mortality.26 Compared to other etiologies,\npost-transplant cardiovascular events are higher in LT recipi\ufffeents with NASH cirrhosis, especially in the immediate post\ufffeoperative period.27 Therefore, several societies recommend\ncomprehensive cardiovascular risk assessment and testing\nduring the LT evaluation process.\nWhile it is important to thoroughly evaluate these patients,\nit is unclear what constitutes comprehensive cardiovascular\nevaluation and that itself varies significantly across the LT\ncenters. However, the general approach should focus on\nidentifying underlying CVD, congestive heart failure and\nportopulmonary hypertension, and optimize these conditions\nprior to LT surgery and exclude high-risk patients. Patients\nwith clinically significant congestive heart failure should be\nexcluded from LT due to the risk of decompensation and\ndeath. High-risk patients with coronary artery disease should\nFig. 2. Temporal trends in annual waitlist additions for top 5 etiologies in\nthe USA UNOS 2008-2018.\nAbbreviations: ALD, alcoholic liver disease; CC, cryptogenic cirrhosis;\nHCV, hepatitis C virus; NASH, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; UNOS,\nUnited Network for Organ Sharing.\nJournal of Clinical and Translational Hepatology 2020 vol. 8 | 215–221 217\nGadiparthi C. et al: Liver transplantation in NASH patients\n\neither undergo revascularization before transplant surgery or\nbe excluded from the waitlist.28 Additionally, patients with\nmoderate to severe portopulmonary hypertension who fail\nto respond to vasodilator therapy are considered high-risk\nand should be excluded from LT.29\nBoth structural and functional cardiac evaluation is\nrequired in LT candidates. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing\nis challenging because cirrhotic patients may be decondi\ufffetioned with poor performance status, ascites, malnutrition,\nand frailty. Doppler echocardiography is routinely performed\nto assess left and right ventricular and valvular function and\nto screen for pulmonary hypertension. Noninvasive stress\ntesting is performed using dobutamine stress echocardio\ufffegram or myocardial perfusion imaging, and if abnormal,\nfurther evaluation with cardiac catheterization may be\nrequired. Although, dobutamine stress echocardiogram has\nshown to be a good noninvasive test to evaluate coronary\nischemia in the general population, it suffers from poor\nsensitivity in cirrhotic patients due to difficulty in achieving\ntarget heart rate and double product, perhaps due to use of\nbetablockers for variceal prophylaxis in many patients.30\nBecause of these limitations, several centers routinely\nperform right and left heart catheterization as a part of trans\ufffeplant evaluation process of NASH patients. Although this\napproach is debated, it may be reasonable in these patients\ndue to their inherently higher cardiovascular risk. Further\ufffemore, this approach allows identifying patients with clinically\nsilent coronary artery disease and provides an opportunity to\nrevascularize them prior to LT. However, it is interesting to\nnote that in a small study of 13 patients, 50% with severe\ncoronary artery disease died due to cardiovascular causes\nafter LT surgery despite undergoing revascularization (3 per\ufffecutaneous coronary intervention and 6 coronary artery\nbypass graft surgery) prior to surgery.31 This suggests that\nthere may be other factors to consider before embarking on\nLT surgery in NASH patients.\nOther traditional risk factors, such as hypertension, hyper\ufffelipidemia, T2DM and CKD should be screened and managed\nappropriately. Despite the small potential risk of hepatotox\ufffeicity, statins have far reaching benefits against progression of\ncirrhosis, portal hypertension and HCC beyond treating\nhyperlipidemia and thus should be strongly considered.32\nFinally, the LT evaluation process should include a multidisci\ufffeplinary team approach, including cardiology, cardiac anes\ufffethesiology, nephrology, endocrinology and nutrition in\naddition to hepatology and transplant surgery, to appropri\ufffeately risk stratify and optimize NASH patients to improve\npost-transplant outcomes.\nObesity and role of bariatric surgery\nIt is clear that obesity is highly prevalent in NASH patients.\nObesity by itself and high body mass index are not absolute\ncontraindications for LT surgery. Moreover, body mass index is\nnot a reliable indicator and tends to overestimate obesity in\nthe presence of ascites and volume overload. Studies on\neffects of obesity on LT outcomes have shown conflicting\nresults. In a large meta-analysis published in 2015 that\nincluded 13 studies comparing 2275 obese patients with\n72212 non-obese LT recipients, body mass index did not\nnegatively impact the post-transplant survival.33 Because\nbody mass index is a less reliable surrogate for obesity,\nother parameters such as visceral adipose tissue and\nmuscle mass should be included in the evaluation process to\noptimally predict post-transplant survival.34\nBased on the Scientific Registry of Organ Transplants data\nfrom 1994 to 2013 that included over 85,000 adult LT\nrecipients, body mass index values did not impact post\ufffetransplant survival, whereas T2DM in LT recipients in both\npre-transplant (hazard ratio of 1.21, 95% confidence interval\nof 1.12-1.30) and post-transplant settings (hazard ratio of\n1.06, 95% confidence interval of 1.02-1.11) and T2DM in\ndonors (hazard ratio of 1.10; 95% confidence interval of\n1.02-1.19) were associated with poor outcomes.35 Therefore,\nit is evident that, not obesity alone, but the presence of other\nmetabolic comorbidities in addition to obesity lead to poorer\noutcomes. Nevertheless, a body mass index of $40 is gener\ufffeally considered a relative contraindication for LT in most\ncenters.\nBariatric surgery is a feasible option for morbidly obese\npatients. Due to lack of data regarding long-term follow-up,\nthe optimal timing of bariatric surgery whether before, during\nor after LT surgery remains unclear. Although metabolic\ncomorbidities seem to improve with bariatric surgery in the\npre-transplant setting, studies have reported significantly\nhigher post-operative complications.36,37 Concomitant LT\nand bariatric surgery is an option in highly select patients.\nIn a Mayo study, LT candidates with a body mass index of\n$35 who were unable to achieve weight loss goal in the\npre-transplant setting underwent combined LT surgery and\nsleeve gastrectomy.38 Compared to the LT alone group, the\ncombined LT-sleeve gastrectomy group achieved more sus\ufffetained weight loss at 3-year post-transplant follow-up and\nwere less likely to develop insulin resistance, hepatic steato\ufffesis and hypertension. However, this approach is limited by\nprolonged surgery time, immediate need for immunosup\ufffepression post-transplant, and risk of poor nutrition status.39\nOverall, based on studies, sleeve gastrectomy appears to be a\npreferred option compared to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass\nsurgery and has several advantages. Compared to Roux-en\ufffeY gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy requires less operative\ntime, does not cause malabsorption or altered anatomy,\nmaintains adequate immunosuppression, and provides endo\ufffescopic access to the biliary system in the event of post-oper\ufffeative biliary complications.26 While weight-loss is a desired\ngoal in NASH patients, it is important to screen and manage\nmalnutrition and sarcopenia, which are independent predic\ufffetors of poor waitlist and post-transplant mortality. Studies\nFig. 3. Temporal trends of annual liver transplantations for top 5 etiol\ufffeogies in the USA UNOS 2008-2018.\nAbbreviations: ALD, alcoholic liver disease; CC, cryptogenic cirrhosis;\nHCV, hepatitis C virus; NASH, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; UNOS,\nUnited Network for Organ Sharing.\n218 Journal of Clinical and Translational Hepatology 2020 vol. 8 | 215–221\nGadiparthi C. et al: Liver transplantation in NASH patients\n\nhave shown that up to 25% of obese patients suffer from\nmalnutrition.40 Therefore, it is very critical to maintain\nproper nutrition and adequate protein supplementation in\nobese NASH patients who undergo bariatric surgery or are\nenrolled in weight-loss programs, to avoid malnutrition and\nsarcopenia.\nPost-transplant outcomes of NASH compared other\nCLDs\nDespite the higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in\nNASH patients, several studies have shown that post-trans\ufffeplant outcomes of NASH patients are similar to those of other\nindications of LT. In a large systematic review comparing LT\nrecipients with NASH (n=717) and non-NASH (n=3520), 1-\nyear, 3-year, and 5-year post-transplant survival rates were\nsimilar between the two groups, although the NASH patients\nwere older, with higher prevalence of women, had higher\nbody mass index, and were more likely to have T2DM, hyper\ufffetension and hyperlipidemia compared to non-NASH counter\ufffeparts.41 While NASH patients experienced higher mortality\ndue to CVD (odds ratio of 1.65, 95% confidence interval of\n1.01-2.70; p = 0.05) and sepsis (odds ratio of 1.71; 95%\nconfidence interval of 1.17-2.50; p = 0.006), graft failure\nwas lower (odds ratio of 0.21; 95% confidence interval of\n0.05-0.89; p=0.03) compared to non-NASH LT recipients.\nStudies based on UNOS data, showed similar results. From\n2001 to 2009, comparing 1959 NASH LT recipients and\n33,822 non-NASH patients, 1-year and 3-year post-LT sur\ufffevival was similar: 84% and 78% for NASH respectively,\n86% and 79% for cryptogenic cirrhosis, and 87% and 78%\nfor other indications (p=0.67).14 A more recent UNOS study\nfrom 2003 to 2014 showed outcomes of 63,061 adult LT recip\ufffeients, including 20,782 HCV patients (32.96%), 9470 ALD\npatients (15.02%), and 8262 NASH patients (13.11%).\nResults of this study demonstrated that 5-year post-trans\ufffeplant survival was better in NASH patients compared to HCV\n(77.81% vs. 72.15, p<0.001) despite the NASH cohort being\nmore likely to have obesity and higher rates of T2DM and\nCVD.12\nIn another retrospective study, Sadler et al.42 showed that\nHCC patients with NASH (60/929, 6.5%) and non-NASH\n(869/929, 93.5%) had similar 1-year, 3-year, 5-year survival\nrates (98%, 96%, and 80% respectively in NASH vs. 95%,\n84%, and 78% in non-NASH, p=0.1). Overall, based on mul\ufffetiple studies, both single-center as well as those involving\nlarge databases, NASH patients, despite the older age and\nhigher prevalence of comorbidities compared to other etiolo\ufffegies, showed similar post-transplant survival. This could, in\ufffepart, be explained by better graft survival rates and rigorous\nLT selection process, where patients with higher cardiovascu\ufffelar risk are excluded from the LT waitlist.26\nRecurrent NASH after LT\nWhile recurrent NASH is an important complication in LT\nrecipients with NASH, de novo NASH is a growing concern in\nnon-NASH LT recipients. There are several reasons for this:\npatients in the post-transplant setting generally feel well, not\nin a catabolic state of cirrhosis, and are more likely increase\nthe daily calorie intake, resulting in accelerated weight gain.\nIn fact, use of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive\nagents, including calcineurin inhibitors and mammalian target\nrapamycin inhibitors can result in metabolic derangement and\ndevelopment of obesity, insulin resistance, T2DM, hyperten\ufffesion, and hyperlipidemia.43–46 Additionally, some studies\nhave suggested that non-NASH indications, such as HCV\nand ALD, are also associated with development of de novo\nNASH after LT.47,48 There exists a considerable heterogeneity\namong the studies that estimated the prevalence of recurrent\nand de novo NASH. In a study, 30% of the LT recipients with\nNASH developed recurrent steatohepatitis at 1-year;\nhowever, none of them developed cirrhosis in long-term\nfollow-up.49 The rates of recurrent NAFL in another study,\ncomprising 257 NASH/cryptogenic cirrhosis LT recipients, at\n1-year, 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year follow-up were higher\n(8.2%, 13.6%, 24.9%, and 32.9% respectively) compared\nto non-NASH/cryptogenic cirrhosis LT recipients (3.1%,\n5.9%, 9.6%, and 10%).50 However, the rate of recurrent\nNASH was much lower, at 5% (13 out of 257), and advanced\nfibrosis was rare, and in fact, post-LT survival was similar to\nthat in the non-NASH/cryptogenic cirrhosis group. Neverthe\ufffeless, CVD and infection-related complications were higher in\npatients with recurrent NAFL. Therefore, these patients\nshould be closely monitored to prevent rapid weight gain,\nand screened for development of metabolic conditions and\nmanaged accordingly.\nPresence of NAFLD in donor livers is another challenge,\ndue to overall increasing prevalence of NAFLD in the general\npopulation. This ominous trend not only affects the quality\nand numbers of donor livers but it also may cause delayed or\nprimary graft dysfunction, as well as graft loss and poor\nrecipient outcomes ultimately.51–54 Steatosis-induced\nmicrocirculatory and cellular dysfunction following reperfu\ufffesion is thought to be a major cause for hepatocyte necrosis\nand graft loss. Thus, it is important to identify the extent of\nsteatosis in donor livers. Mild steatosis (<30%) in the donor\ngrafts is generally accepted and not associated with poor\noutcomes compared to more than >30%, which showed\npoor outcomes at 1-year after transplant.51,52,54 Some\ntransplant centers routinely perform donor rush liver\nbiopsy prior to LT and discard high-risk grafts; however,\nthis approach may prolong cold-ischemia time and is not\nwidely available in all centers. Nonetheless, donor steatosis\ndoes not appear to affect rates of recurrent NASH in NASH\uffferecipients more than non-NASH recipients and therefore,\nthere is insufficient data to recommend different approach\nin each group at this time.\nConclusions\nNAFLD is steadily raising throughout the world and is on a\ntrajectory to become the number 1 indication of LT in the USA.\nDespite the prevalence of metabolic comorbidities, post\ufffetransplant survival for NASH is comparable to other etiolo\ufffegies. Obesity alone is not a contraindication for LT in the\nabsence of other comorbid conditions and body mass index is\nnot a reliable indicator of obesity in the presence of ascites\nand volume overload. Weight loss surgery before or during LT\nsurgery can be considered in select patients but it is limited\nonly to specialized centers, due to higher complication rates.\nPrevention of sarcopenia and malnutrition while achieving\nweight loss is a challenging task. LT cures end-stage liver\ndisease but not the underlying metabolic risk factors asso\ufffeciated with NAFLD; therefore, strategies to address these\ncomorbidities are crucial to improve outcomes and prevent\nrecurrence of NAFLD after transplantation.

This potential dysfunction of mitochondria after I/R injury \ncould be responsible for the initial poor graft function or primary nonfunction observed after liver \ntransplantation. Thus, determining the mechanisms that lead to human hepatic mitochondrial \ndysfunction might contribute to improving the outcome of liver transplantation. Furthermore, early \nidentification of novel prognostic factors involved in I/R injury could serve as a key endpoint to \npredict the outcome of liver grafts and also to promote the early adoption of novel strategies that \nprotect against I/R injury. Here, we briefly review recent advances in the study of mitochondrial \ndysfunction and I/R injury, particularly in relation to liver transplantation. Next, we highlight various \npharmacological therapeutic strategies that could be applied, and discuss their relationship to \nrelevant mitochondrion-related processes and targets. Lastly, we note that although considerable \nprogress has been made in our understanding of I/R injury and mitochondrial dysfunction, further \ninvestigation is required to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these \nprocesses, thereby identifying biomarkers that can help in evaluating donor organs.\nKey words: Liver transplantation; Mitochondria; Ischemia/reperfusion injury; Liver preservation solution; \nPharmacological conditioning\nIntroduction\nIschemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a \nmultifactorial process by which cellular damage is \ninitiated in organs during hypoxia, after which cells \nare then stressed by restoration of oxygen delivery \nand rebalancing of pH. This phenomenon is a major \nfactor underlying the injury that occurs in liver \nsurgery, mostly during liver transplantation (LT), and \nremains a source of major complications affecting \nperioperative morbidity and mortality. Consequently, \nit is critical to clarify the molecular mechanisms and \nregulatory processes involved in organ damage after \nI/R injury, a complex process that comprises a \ncascade of events that promote inflammation and \ntissue damage, including energy loss, generation of \nreactive oxygen species (ROS), release of cytokines \nand chemokines, and, finally, activation of immune \ncells [1-5].\nIn I/R injury, one of the most notable features is \nthe deterioration of mitochondrial function coupled \nwith subsequent adjustment of energy metabolism. \nDuring ischemia, the absence of oxygen leads to \ncessation of oxidative phosphorylation (which plays a \nIvyspring\nInternational Publisher\n\nInt. J. Med. Sci. 2018, Vol. 15\nhttp://www.medsci.org\n249\ncrucial role in energy production), heightened \ngeneration of ROS, and initiation of apoptosis [6].\nCurrently, to treat patients with end-stage liver \ndiseases or irreversible tumors of hepatic origin, LT is \nan established therapeutic regimen. However, an \nobstacle to LT is related to the lack of a donor pool; \nconsequently, the mortality rate among LT \nwaiting-list patients has been estimated to exceed \n20%. This shortage has encouraged the adoption of \nextended criteria for selecting donor organs; however, \nthese organs are particularly susceptible to I/R injury \n[7-9]. In LT, functional and structural damage caused \nto donor organs by the process of cold \npreservation/warm reperfusion are major problems, \nand these can result in a non-functional graft or \nprimary graft dysfunction [10, 11].\nTo understand liver damage caused by I/R \ninjury, characterizing mitochondrial activity after I/R \nis critical. The early identification of the cellular and \nmolecular changes that occur might allow the \nadoption of new strategies that protect against I/R \ninjury, and thus help maintain mitochondrial function \nand liver energy balance.\nLiver Transplantation\nLT has developed over the past six decades from \nan experimental procedure to the standard of care for \npatients with end-stage liver disease. In LT, the \nlong-term outcome has been improved as a result of \nadvances in surgical techniques, the subsequent \nimmunosuppressive regimens, in donor liver \nselection, and in postoperative care. However, during \nthe past few decades, the number of patients awaiting \nan organ for transplantation has increased [7, 12, 13], \nand this has necessitated the extension of the criteria \nfor organ donation and the use of marginal donors \npreviously considered inadequate for LT (e.g. \nallowing for an increase in the age considered suitable \nfor donors, the use of organs after prolonged cold \nischemia, or donation after cardiac death or hepatic \nsteatosis) [14]. Notably, the risk of primary graft \nnonfunction after the transplant of fatty donor organs \nis markedly higher than that after non-steatotic grafts \n(60% vs 5%).\nSevere macrovesicular steatosis (> 60%) has been \nlinked with > 60% risk of primary nonfunction after \ntransplantation, and this has been calculated to be \nresponsible for the rejection of 25% of donor livers [15, \n16]. As a consequence of the shortage of donors, the \nMELD score (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease \nscore) was adopted in 2002. The MELD score is used \nto predict the 3-month mortality from the patient’s \nliver disease, and it was adopted worldwide to help \nselect patients from the recipient waiting list that \nshould receive specific donor organs [17]. Selection of \nthe correct donor, particularly in living donor LT, is \ncritical to increase the survival of the graft and the \nrecipient [18].\nDiagnosing pre-existing liver disease is a crucial \npart of donor organ evaluation, and histopathological \nexamination plays an essential role in this analysis \nand in the assessment of the donor liver. However, \ndespite efforts to improve the quality of the donor \nliver pool, some of the LT patients will develop initial \npoor function and primary nonfunction [19, 20].\nCurrently, the three most common indications \nfor LT are hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatitis C virus \ninfection, and alcoholic cirrhosis. In this regard, other \nindications are also used, such as those for acute \nfulminant liver failure (e.g. acute acetaminophen \noverdose, mushroom poisoning, fulminant hepatitis \nA or B infection, Wilson’s disease, acute Budd-Chiari \nsyndrome, or failed LT), cholestatic liver disease (e.g. \nprimary biliary cirrhosis), and metabolic disorders \n(e.g. α-1-antitrypsin deficiency, non-alcoholic fatty \nliver disease) [21, 22].\nIn LT, the outcome is potently affected by liver \npreservation, which is one of the most critical \ncomponent steps of LT [23]. The standard practice of \nliver preservation involves the use of preservation \nsolutions at low temperatures (2–4 °C) under static, \ncool preservation conditions. In the 1980s, Belzer and \nSouthard designed the University of Wisconsin (UW) \nsolution, which is probably the most commonly used \nstatic preservation solution employed under \nhypothermic conditions, wherein the organ is \nperfused with cool preservation solution and held on \nice; this has become the prevalent method for liver \nallograft preservation. The UW solution features an \nintracellular-type electrolyte composition, and to \nprevent tissue edema, the solution contains three \ninhibitory molecules: lactobionate, raffinose, and \ncolloidal hydroxyethyl starch [24]. Conversely, in the \nhistidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution, \nwhose potassium concentration is slightly lower than \nthat of the UW solution, the main impairment \nmolecule is the amino acid histidine, and the HTK \nsolution does not contain a colloid [25]. Another \npreservation solution, Celsior, which was developed \nin early 1990, contains histidine, a low concentration \nof glutathione, and incorporates lactobionate and \nmannitol as inhibitors. Celsior and the HTK solution \nare considerably less viscous than the UW solution \n[26].\nLastly, in clinical LT, the application of ex vivo\nmachine preservation/perfusion is currently under \ninvestigation, and various temperatures (hypothermia \nor normothermia) and diverse preservation solutions \nare being tested. The development of new techniques \nwill likely lead to an alteration in the manner in which \n\nInt. J. Med. Sci. 2018, Vol. 15\nhttp://www.medsci.org\n250\norgans are perfused, preserved, and transported \n[27-29].\nIschemia/Reperfusion\nI/R injury induces damage to a hypoxic organ \nafter oxygen delivery is restored, and this might occur \nin several clinical situations, such as trauma, \nhemorrhage, shock, thermal injury, transplantation, \nand certain types of liver surgery. In contrast to the \nischemia under such clinical conditions, cold ischemia \nis exclusively related to the transplant setting.\nThe specific period of cold ischemia (used to \nreduce metabolic activities of the graft) begins when a \ndonor graft is harvested using a cold perfusion \nsolution and ends after the tissue reaches the \nphysiological temperature during the implantation \nprocedures. The cold ischemia process is followed by \na period of warm ischemia, which ends with the \ncompletion of surgical anastomosis after blood-flow \nrestoration [30, 31]. Inevitably, this step is responsible \nfor the major part of the LT injury and the \ndevelopment of graft failure that is coupled with \nconsiderable morbidity and mortality in patients [32]\n(Figure 1).\nThe cellular and molecular mechanisms of I/R \ninjury are poorly understood; however, the injury is \nrecognized to affect hepatocytes and biliary epithelial \ncells. The I/R injury caused by cold ischemia and \nwarm ischemia can produce common and specific \neffects on various subsets of cells. For example, \nsinusoidal endothelial cells are more susceptible to the \neffects of cold preservation than are hepatic \nparenchymal cells. In the remaining viable endothelial \ncells, the expression of adhesion molecules is affected, \nand this accentuates the I/R injury (Figure 2).\nFigure 1. Schematic timeline of the liver transplantation phases of I/R injury.\nFigure 2. I/R injury caused by cold ischemia and warm ischemia can produce common and specific effects on various subsets of cells. For example, sinusoidal \nendothelial cells are more susceptible than hepatic parenchymal cells to the effects of cold preservation, and the reperfusion phase amplifies the ischemic injury with \nthe preferential involvement of the hepatic parenchymal cells; A- space of Disse; B- sinusoid; C- sinusoidal endothelial cells (with fenestrae); D- biliary canaliculus; E\ufffeStellate cell; F- Kupffer cell; H- hepatocyte; N- nucleus.\n\nInt. J. Med. Sci. 2018, Vol. 15\nhttp://www.medsci.org\n251\nConversely, in the reperfusion phase, ischemic \ninjury can be amplified with the preferential \ninvolvement of hepatocytes. During this period, the \ngeneration of ROS causes nonspecific oxidative \ndamage to lipids, proteins, and DNA [33].\nTwo distinct phases follow reperfusion: an early \nphase that lasts for the first 2 h after reperfusion; and a \nlate phase that extends from 6 to 48 h after \nreperfusion.\nThe early phase is characterized by the activation \nof immune cells and oxidative stress. In the initial \nstages, the activation of Kupffer cells leads to ROS \ngeneration, which causes moderate hepatocellular \ninjury. This oxidative damage is then increased as a \nconsequence of the release of several \nproinflammatory chemokines and cytokines (e.g. \ntumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interleukin (IL)-12 \nand IL-1β), and this promotes and amplifies the later \nsecondary inflammatory phase [34, 35].\nThe occurrence of the late phase is mediated by \nneutrophils, whose involvement depends on the \nchemokines released in the early stage. These \nneutrophils release proteases and other cytotoxic \nenzymes (e.g. collagenase, elastase, cathepsin G, and \nheparanase) that act within cellular membranes and \non matrix components, thereby promoting cellular \ndegradation [36, 37].\nMitochondrial Activity and I/R\nMitochondrial activity is involved in the I/R \nprocess, and the change in in this parameter might be \ncritical for I/R injury. The most crucial change \ninduced by I/R injury is related to the deterioration of \nmitochondrial function and the consequent alteration \nin energy metabolism.\nIn cold ischemia, oxygen deprivation and \nmetabolite reduction lead to a reduction in the natural \nfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and in \nATP synthesis; this results in failure of \nATP-dependent enzymes and a concomitant rise in \nADP, AMP, and Pi concentrations, coupled with the \nconsequent disturbances in membrane ion \ntranslocation and cytoskeletal disruption. During this \nperiod, any ATP that is produced is used to preserve \nthe mitochondrial membrane potential, and the ATP \nyield from glycolysis is insufficient [36,37].\nDuring ischemia, an increase in the intracellular \nconcentrations of H+, Na+, and Ca2+ causes \nmitochondrial dysfunction. This increase in Na+ is \nassociated with ATP depletion, which inhibits\nNa+/K+ ATPases. The increased Na+ concentration \npromotes Ca2+ influx through the Na+–Ca2+\nexchanger, which is responsible for the irreversible \ncell injury that occurs. The intracellular Ca2+ increase \nassociated with Ca2+-ATPase failure mainly affects \nsinusoidal endothelial cells [38].\nThe source of ROS generation during hepatic I/R \nremains unclear; however, it might involve complexes \nI and III of the electron transport chain or possibly \nxanthine/xanthine oxidase. ROS promote the \nperoxidation of the components of the phospholipids \n(unsaturated fatty acids) of the inner mitochondrial \nmembrane, and this disrupts the electron flow \nthrough the electron transport chain. Moreover, \nduring the reperfusion phase, the damage caused to \nmitochondrial lipids and proteins enhances ROS \ngeneration. If the tissue damage occurs for only a \nshort time, mitochondria can repair themselves and \ncontinue to generate ATP; however, if a critical period \nis exceeded, mitochondrial recovery is not possible \n[39].\nDuring mitochondrial damage, once mitochon\ufffedrial permeability transition (MPT) has been \npermanently initiated, the mitochondrial inner \nmembrane collapses, which enables solutes with a \nmolecular mass of up to 1.5 kDa to cross the inner \nmembrane. MPT promotes the release of certain \napoptotic factors (such as cytochrome c) from the \nmitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol \nthrough channels formed by Bax (a proapoptotic Bcl-2 \nfamily member). After I/R, the predominant type of \ncell death is necrosis, but the onset of MPT can induce \napoptosis in the ischemic liver [4, 40-42]. MPT is a \ncommon pathway leading to both types of cell death \nafter I/R: necrosis and either apoptosis or necroptosis.\nDamaged mitochondria are cleared through the \nselective autophagy process of mitophagy, a catabolic \npathway that favors cell survival by preserving \nenergy levels and preventing the accumulation of \ndamaged mitochondria and cytotoxic mitochondrial \nsubproducts [43, 44]. At least two types of mitophagy \nexist: the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-dependent \nand -independent types [45]. In normoxia or short \nischemia, the demand for mitophagy is negligible \nbecause only a few mitochondria are damaged. By \ncontrast, in prolonged ischemia and reperfusion, the \nincrease in Ca2+ and ROS levels induce numerous \ndamaged mitochondria, which must be rapidly \nremoved via mitophagy to prevent autophagy failure \ncaused by the increase in the number of injured \nmitochondria [46].\nMitochondrial Targeting Strategies \nagainst I/R Injury in Liver \nTransplantation\nI/R is a multifactorial process and the animal \nmodels used to study it have limitations; thus, most of \nthe animal studies on I/R have not translated to \nhuman trials [4]. In the literature, multiple therapeutic \nstrategies against hepatic I/R injury have been \n\nInt. J. Med. Sci. 2018, Vol. 15\nhttp://www.medsci.org\n252\nreported. Furthermore, numerous experimental \ninvestigations have suggested that the use of various \ndrugs (synthetic and natural derivatives) could \nprevent or reduce the injury related to I/R; however, \ndespite these efforts, no ‘optimal’ drug has been \nidentified to date. Nevertheless, the strong \nimplication of mitochondrial involvement in I/R \ninjury justifies a careful analysis of various available \ntherapeutic options in relation to their effects on \nmitochondrial function. Diverse therapeutic \napproaches have been attempted thus far, including \nthose involving the storage process (cold storage, \nmachine perfusion), manual conditioning, and \nmultiple pharmacological conditioning. These \napproaches can promote a reduction in I/R injury, \nwhich indicates the importance of the relationship \nbetween mitochondrial activity and the mitigation of \nI/R injury.\nWith regard to the aforementioned relationship, \nthe most important mitochondrion-related processes \nand targets are the following: (1) MPT onset, (2) \ncalcium channel inhibition, (3) autophagy, (4) \nantioxidants, (5) nitric oxide (NO), (6) TNF-α, (7) \napoptosis, and (8) nucleic acids as drugs (Figure 3).\nMPT is a phenomenon involved in calcium \nsignaling and cell destruction. A previous study \nshowed that MPT inhibition with cyclosporine A \nreduced mitochondrial ROS production in response to \ncalcium [47]. Moreover, Mg2+, acidic pH, and \ntrifluoperazine were shown to prevent the opening of \npermeability transition pores; whereas calcium, \ninorganic phosphate, alkaline pH, and ROS were \nshown to promote the onset of MPT [48]. \nMitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation and \noverloading are responsible for the cell abnormality \nassociated with I/R injury. In one study, pretreatment \nwith the calcium-channel blocker amlodipine restored \ncellular normality and counteracted the alteration in \nmitochondrial enzymes induced by I/R injury [49]. In \nanother study, the calcium-channel inhibitor, \n2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, prevented Ca2+\noverloading, cytochrome c release, and cell death \nduring I/R [50].\nMitochondrial autophagy can play a protective \nrole in liver I/R injury [51]. Heme oxygenase-1 can \nprevent liver I/R injury by suppressing inflammation \nand eliciting an antiapoptotic response, and inhibition \nof this enzyme reduced autophagy and upregulated \napoptosis [52]. Furthermore, autophagy inhibition \naggravated starvation-induced ROS accumulation, \nwhich contributed to hepatocyte necrosis [53].\nThe deleterious effects produced by ROS could \npotentially be reduced using antioxidants. For \nexample, mangafodipir trisodium, a powerful \nantioxidant, exerts a protective effect when \nadministrated to the donor before organ harvesting \n[54]. Furthermore, herbal antioxidants, such as green \ntea catechins, tetrandrine, quercetin, and \ntrans-resveratrol can efficiently reduce I/R injury and \ncould act directly as antioxidants and indirectly \nthrough the activation of Nrf2 [55-57]. Another \nexample is glutathione, a crucial molecule in the cell’s \ndefense against oxidative stress, and N-acetylcysteine, \na glutathione precursor, might help to maintain or \nreplenish hepatic glutathione stores [58]. Pretreatment \nwith N-acetylcysteine can improve glutathione \nhomeostasis, enhance ATP regeneration, and increase \nsurvival [59].\nMitochondria reduce nitrite to NO, and this is \nusually sufficient to inactivate redox-active iron ions. \nNO is a signaling mediator involved in numerous \ncellular activities, such as the regulation of \nmicrocirculation and the inhibition of caspase activity \nin apoptosis pathways [60]. Nitrite protects against \nI/R injury and improves mitochondrial function by \ninhibiting the iron-mediated oxidative reactions that \noccur as a consequence of the release of iron ions \nduring hypoxia [61]. During liver I/R injury, the \nprotective effects of NO, including the potentiation of \nhepatic ATP levels, reduce oxidative damage and \nalleviate the adverse effects of endothelin. However, \nthe safe therapeutic window of NO is limited because \nlarge amounts of NO can damage liver tissue [62, 63].\nTNF-α is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays \na major role in hepatocyte apoptosis and triggers \napoptotic liver damage. In mitochondria, TNF-α\ninduces the formation of MPT pores, the release of \ncytochrome c, and the activation of caspases [64-66]. \nIn animal models, TNF-α induces apoptotic liver \ninjury only when hepatocyte-specific transcription is \ninhibited, whereas in the absence of this inhibition, it \nprotects against liver damage. Thus, TNF-α \npreconditioning with low doses of TNF-α or the \nblockade of TNF-α action (e.g. with anti-TNF-α \nantibodies) prevents hepatocellular apoptosis and \nliver injury [67].\nAs a consequence of I/R injury, the \nmitochondrial respiratory chain is disrupted, and this \ncan lead to ATP loss and initiation of apoptosis \nthrough caspase activation and cytochrome c release. \nCyclosporine A treatment could serve as a promising \nadjunct therapeutic approach, because cyclosporine A \nlimits the activation of the apoptotic machinery by \ninhibiting MPT [68]. Moreover, supplementation with \ndibutyryl-cAMP could promote the inhibition of \nmitochondrial apoptosis by stimulating the cAMP \nsecond-messenger signaling pathway and \nsubsequently reducing the release of cytochrome c\ninto the cytosol [69].\nCurrent data indicate that circulating \n\nInt. J. Med. Sci. 2018, Vol. 15\nhttp://www.medsci.org\n253\nmicroRNAs could serve as non-invasive biomarkers \nbecause of their association with liver diseases and \nliver injury. Farid et al. demonstrated that serum \nlevels of microRNAs (e.g., miR-122) increased before \nan elevation of transaminase levels [70]. This could \nrepresent a critical finding because the currently used \nbiochemical blood parameters related to liver \ndisease/injury and dysfunction are nonspecific [71]. \nSome studies relate the role of mitochondria \nwith the genetic regulation by RNA \ninterference[72-75](Figure 4). \nThe use of nucleic acids as drugs represents the \nultimate therapy [76]. RNA interference (RNAi) is a \nbiological process in which RNA molecules neutralize \ntargeted mRNA molecules by inhibiting gene \nexpression or translation. Several options are \navailable for synthetic and expressed RNAi. The most \ncommonly used form of synthetic RNAi involves the \nuse of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which occur \nnaturally in the cytoplasm or are synthesized outside \nand then introduced into the cell. Intraportal \nadministration of siRNAs targeting caspase-8 and \ncaspase-3 promoted a reduction in lesions induced in \nthe liver by warm I/R via RNAi-mediated inhibition \nof the expression of caspase-8 and caspase-3, which \nare both components of the apoptotic process [77]. \nOther RNAi therapies that have been applied to \nprevent I/R injury targeted IL-1β/nuclear factor \nkappa B (NF- κB) (transcription-related factors), Fas \ncell surface death receptor (Fas) and acid \nsphingomyelinase (ASMase) (apoptosis), and \nadiponectin (oxidative stress)[78-80]. Recent advances \nin nanomedicine have led to progress in the design of \nRNA/DNA drug-delivery systems, such as the \ndevelopment of a multifunctional envelope-type nano \ndevice that can control intracellular trafficking in \nspecific cells in vivo and enables drug targeting to the \nmitochondrial system [81, 82]. MITO-Porter is a \nspecific delivery system to mitochondria that allows \nthe introduction of macromolecules cargoes into \nmitochondria. To date, this system was used to \ndelivery antisense oligo-RNA with functional effect \non mitochondria[83, 84].\nOne of the therapeutic approaches that has\nattracted the most attention recently is the use of \nmachine perfusion. The first randomized controlled \ntrial comparing normothermic machine perfusion \nwith cold storage revealed that machine perfusion is \nsafe and can preserve liver function outside the body \nfor 24 h. Moreover, using this technique, liver \nfunction can be assessed, including bile production \nand clearance of lactic acidosis [85]. In the future, it is \nbelieved that it should be possible to assess specific \nmiRNAs during organ preservation to evaluate the \npotential liver injury related to the I/R process and \nthe RNAi that might be active during normothermic \npreservation or the reperfusion phase.\nFigure 3.

Interaction between the regulation of gene expression by RNA interference due to the presence of pre-mature (pre-miRNA) and mature (miRNA) \nmicroRNAs and the mitochondria system\nConclusions and Future Perspectives\nAlthough considerable effort has been devoted\nto studying I/R injury, the molecular and cellular \nmechanisms involved in this process remain \nincompletely determined and require further \ninvestigation. \nIn evaluating the quality of donor organs for LT, \na critical aspect could be the identification of \nbiomarkers. For example, microRNAs have been \nestablished as key posttranscriptional regulators in \nthe liver, and could be used in LT as valuable \nbiomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. \nTo improve the outcome of the LT, \npharmacological agents could be added to the \npreservation solutions used for the donor liver. \nAlthough this has been extensively investigated using \nanimal models, few clinical trials have been \nconducted, because most of these studies were \nconducted in unrealistic conditions without the \npotential to be translated for clinical use [86]. \nThe development of new mitochondrial drug \ndelivery systems could be helpful to use some of these \nmitochondrial targets directly into the mitochondria\n[87]. \nNowadays, the most promisor’s \nmitochondrion-related targets are the antioxidant \nagents or caspase inhibitors, which are being studied\nin Phase II trials [88]. \nLastly, because I/R injury is a multifactorial \nprocess, it will probably be necessary to perform \nstudies to assess the results of treatment with \nemergent pharmacological drugs that act on multiple \ntherapeutic targets. Translational research could \nrepresent a solution to increase the donor liver pool \nand improve the outcome of LT [89, 90].\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by Sociedade \nPortuguesa de Transplantação (SPT), Astellas Pharma \nand Centro de Investigação do Meio Ambiente, \nGenética e Oncobiologia (CIMAGO).

How has the evidence changed regarding acceptable macro/microsteatosis in liver grafts?,"['Yang\xa0et\xa0al.

Currently, whole organ allograft \ntransplantation is the gold standard for the treatment of end-stage liver disease. A shortage of suitable organs, high \ncosts and surgical complications limit the application of liver transplantation. Mesenchymal stem cell therapy has \nbeen considered as a promising alternative approach for end-stage liver disease. Some clinical trials have confirmed \nthe effectiveness of MSC therapy for liver disease, but its application has not been promoted and approved. There are \nstill many issues that should be solved prior to using MSC therapy in clinical applications. The types of liver disease \nthat are most suitable for MSC application should be determined, and the preparation and engraftment of MSCs \nshould be standardized. These may be bottlenecks that limit the use of MSCs. We investigated 22 completed and \nseveral ongoing clinical trials to discuss these questions from a clinical perspective. We also discussed the impor\ufffetant mechanisms by which MSCs play a therapeutic role in liver disease. Finally, we also proposed novel prospective \napproaches that can improve the therapeutic effect of MSCs.\nKeywords: Mesenchymal stem cells, Liver disease, Cell therapy\n© The Author(s) 2020.

Many stimuli, such as \nviral hepatitis, alcohol abuse, drugs, metabolic diseases, \nand autoimmune attack, can trigger chronic/acute liver \ninjury and inflammation, which result in liver failure, cir\uffferhosis and associated hepatocellular carcinoma. Ortho\ufffetopic liver transplantation is the only effective treatment \nfor liver cirrhosis and liver failure. However, the number \nof suitable donor organs is very limited. Adults on the \nwaiting list for liver transplantation suffer from a mor\ufffetality rate of almost 11% [1]. Patients are too weak to \nwait for suitable donor organs, so the best opportunity \nfor treatment is missed. In addition, liver transplanta\ufffetion is expensive and not available for all patients. There \nis an urgent need to search for a more effective and \nfeasible treatment for patients with liver cirrhosis and \nliver failure.\nAt present, cell therapy with hepatocytes, hemopoietic \ncells, immune cells, endothelial progenitor cells and mes\ufffeenchymal stem cells has been suggested to be a promis\ufffeing candidate therapy for liver diseases [2]. A large body \nof studies investigated their advantages and disadvan\ufffetages (Table\xa0 1). Among the cell types, MSCs have been \nthe most promising cells because of their many advan\ufffetages. (1) MSCs can be isolated easily from a wide variety \nof tissues and can be expanded in\xa0vitro without changing \ntheir properties. (2) MSCs can be injected into patients \nby allogeneic transplantation because of their low immu\ufffenogenicity. Therefore, we can generate reserves of MSCs \nthat we can give to patients at any time. (3) MSCs have \nthe properties of self-renewal and can differentiate into \nmultiple cell types. (4) Researchers have also shown \nthe robust immunomodulation of MSCs. (5) MSCs \ncan also produce secretomes, including soluble factors \nand exosomes, which can favor regeneration and injury \nrepair. (6) Most importantly, MSCs can migrate to injury \nOpen Access\nCell & Bioscience\n*Correspondence: chenchen_z1@126.com\nTumor Immunology and Gene Therapy Center, Shanghai Eastern \nHepatobiliary Surgery Hospital, 225 Changhai Road, Shanghai 200438, \nChina\n\nYang\xa0et\xa0al.

Therefore, \nMSCs have been used to treat various tissue injuries and \nimmune-related diseases in clinical trials. To date, 321 \ncompleted clinical trials using MSCs were summarized in \nFig.\xa01 according to the website https://clinicaltrials.gov/. \nAmong them, bone/cartilage, brain/Nero and immune\uffferelated diseases account for almost 50% of all MSC-based \nclinical trials. In addition, we have noticed that 16 clini\ufffecal trials are related to liver-related diseases. For liver \ndiseases, however, both tissue damage and overactivation \nof inflammation always go hand in hand. Therefore, from \nevery perspective, MSCs would be the best candidate \nfor cell therapy of liver diseases. However, there are still \nmany issues, and any confusion should be resolved before \nMSC application in the clinic.\nIn this review, several issues that must be addressed \nduring clinical treatment of MSCs are discussed from \nclinical perspectives. (1) Which kind of liver disease is \nmost suitable for MSC application? (2) How should we \nchoose the best source of MSCs, best doses of MSCs \nand best engraftment route of MSCs? (3) What are the \nmechanisms by which MSCs play a therapeutic role in \nliver disease? (4) Finally, we propose potential approaches \nto enhance the therapeutic effect of MSCs, including the \nuse of modified MSCs, pretreated MSCs and cell-free \ntherapy with MSCs. To address these issues, we exam\ufffeined both ongoing and published clinical trials of MSC \napplications in liver diseases. Some preclinical tests were \nalso used to assist in drawing a conclusion. We would like \nto clear up any confusion about MSC applications in liver \ndiseases and help patients receive more appropriate treat\ufffement. This review is intended to be beneficial for creating \na new strategy for MSC application and enhancing the \ntherapeutic effect of MSCs. It will also help to develop a \nmore specific standard for MSC application.\nWhich kind of\xa0liver disease is\xa0most suitable for\xa0MSC \napplication in\xa0the\xa0clinic?\nMSCs have been shown to exert beneficial effects in \na range of clinical settings, including the treatment of \ndegenerative and immune-mediated diseases while also \nbeing reported to ameliorate liver injury in the setting of \nboth acute and chronic liver damage. However, whether \nMSC-based therapy is more effective than conventional \ntreatment and which type of liver disease is best suitable \nfor MSCs application in clinic remained unclear.\nTo find out the indications of MSCs in the treatment \nof liver disease. In this review, we collected a total of 22 \nclinical trial articles on MSCs treatment for liver disease \npublished from 2007 to 2018 (Table\xa02). As shown in the \npie chart in Fig.\xa02a, 14 of them are about MSCs therapy \nfor liver cirrhosis. The other five articles are related to \nliver failure, and three of them are related to complica\ufffetions after liver transplantation.

And for them, the only effec\ufffetive approach is organ transplantation, but its practical \napplication is constrained by some well-known reasons \nsuch as the limited availability of donor organs, surgi\ufffecal complications, immunological side effects, and high \nmedical cost [3]. The development of alternative methods \nfor treatment of liver disease is highly requested. There\ufffefore, stem cell therapy, and regenerative medicine are \nbeing investigated to improve the prognosis of patients \nwith those end-stage liver diseases.\xa0Evaluation of the end \npoints in these studies revealed the safety and efficacy of \nhuman MSC transplantation. While there are some dif\ufffeferences in the therapeutic effects of different types of \nliver diseases.\nMSC therapy for\xa0liver cirrhosis\nLiver cirrhosis (LC)\xa0is a complication of\xa0liver disease\xa0that \ninvolves the loss of\xa0liver\xa0cells and irreversible scarring of \nthe liver. In the 14 articles, patients with cirrhosis caused \nby many forms of liver disease, such as chronic viral \nhepatitis (n=5), chronic alcohol abuse (n=2), primary \nbiliary cirrhosis (n=1), autoimmune hepatitis (n=1) \nand other conditions (n=5 heterogeneous cirrhosis), \nwere included. We believe that the experimental results \nrelated to LC caused by viral hepatitis are the most con\ufffevincing because 4 articles contained large samples of data \nand control groups. In two of the clinical studies men\ufffetioned above that were published in 2012, 30 patients \nwith chronic hepatitis B-related LC and 15 patients with \nchronic hepatitis C-related LC received MSC transfu\ufffesion. In both studies, compared to the control group, the \npatients transplanted with MSCs showed significantly \nimproved liver function, as indicated by the elevation of \nserum albumin levels, a decrease in total serum biliru\ufffebin levels, and a decrease in the sodium model for end\ufffestage liver disease score (MELD score) [4, 5]. Consistent \nwith the above study, two other clinical trials related to \nLC caused by hepatitis B were carried out by different \nresearch institutes and clarified that MSC transplanta\ufffetion further improved the liver function, MELD scores \nand Child–Pugh classification of patients [6, 7]. In the \ntrials conducted by Fang, as many as 103 patients were \nrecruited to participate in the studies; 50 were in the \ntransplant group, and the other patients were in the \ncontrol group. Controlled trials with larger cohorts of \npatients have further confirmed the feasibility of MSC \ntransplantation therapy for virus-related cirrhosis.\nHowever, not all studies have revealed MSCs to have \nthe desired treatment effect on liver cirrhosis. Moham\ufffeadnejad et\xa0 al. [8] enrolled a total of 27 patients with \ndecompensated cirrhosis and ruled out viral-associated \ncirrhosis. The patients in this pilot study were hetero\ufffegeneous regarding the etiology of liver cirrhosis. The \nresults showed that at the 12\xa0months follow-up, the abso\ufffelute changes in the Child scores, MELD scores, serum \nalbumin, international normalized ratio (INR), serum \ntransaminases and liver volumes did not differ signifi\ufffecantly between the MSC and placebo groups. This indi\ufffecates that based on this randomized controlled trial, \nautologous bone marrow MSC transplantation through \nthe peripheral vein probably has no beneficial effect in \ncirrhotic patients. However, based on the above discus\ufffesion, MSC therapy has a positive effect on patients with \nviral-associated cirrhosis. Thus, we speculated that there \nmay be a certain correlation between the therapeutic \neffect of MSCs and the cause of cirrhosis. Interestingly, \nprevious work reported in 2009 by the same author \nshowed that 2\xa0 months after MSC injection, all patients \nhad an improved general condition, quality of life and \nliver function [9]. Why are the results of these two stud\ufffeies completely contradictory? We note that the beneficial \neffects of MSC transplantation shown in the report pub\ufffelished in 2009 are based on the absence of control experi\ufffements. Even if we observed improvement, we could not \nFig. 2 The number and percentage of MSC based completed (a) and ongoing (b) clinical trials classified by liver disease type\n\nYang\xa0et\xa0al. Cell Biosci (2020) 10:123 Page 7 of 18\nclaim that such improvement is definitely related to MSC \ntransplantation. It proved that the controlled trial is criti\ufffecal to the reliability of clinical trial results. Thus, clinical \ntrials associated with heterogeneous LC that lack a con\ufffetrol group have not been explored in depth here.\nFurthermore, another phase 2 trial with a control group \nwas related to alcoholic cirrhosis. Fifty-five patients (18 in \nthe control group, 18 in the one-time MSC group, and 19 \nin the two-time MSC group) completed the study. In the \nfibrosis quantification (before versus after), the one-time \nand two-time BM-MSC groups were associated with 25% \nand 37% reductions in the proportion of the collagen area \nfollowing BM-MSC therapy, respectively. While no sig\ufffenificant change in fibrosis quantification was observed in \nthe control group. These results were further confirmed \nby the Laennec fibrosis score and Child–Pugh score [10]. \nIn summary, judging from existing clinical trial articles, \nMSC treatment may serve as a potential supplementary \ntherapeutic tool to improve liver function in patients \nwith viral-related cirrhosis and alcoholic cirrhosis.\nTo date, only a few large controlled trials have been \nconducted to treat liver cirrhosis patients with MSC \ntransplantation. Several articles related to LC with a small \namount of data or a lack of a control trial also showed \npositive treatment effects for MSCs, which indicated \nthat MSC therapy is also promising for the treatment of \ncirrhosis induced by other factors, such as autoimmune \nhepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis; however, larger \nsamples and double-blind controlled trials are needed for \nfurther verification [11, 12].\nMSC therapy for\xa0liver failure\nLiver failure is a major health problem worldwide due to \nthe variety of acute or chronic injuries that are induced \nby alcohol consumption, hepatotoxic drugs, autoimmune \nattack of hepatocytes, or infection with viruses, such as \nhepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [13]. \nIn China, HBV infection accounts for the highest pro\ufffeportion of liver failure cases. Therefore, Peng et\xa0 al. [14] \nenrolled 53 patients with liver failure caused by hepati\ufffetis B, who underwent MSC transplantation (105 patients \nserved as the control group). The results showed that \nMSC transplantation is safe for patients with liver fail\ufffeure caused by chronic hepatitis B. The short-term effi\ufffecacy was favorable, but long-term outcomes were not \nmarkedly improved. This is in agreement with the results \nof Shi et\xa0 al. and Lin et\xa0 al. who reported trials of MSC \ntransfusion for acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) \npatients in 2012 and 2017, respectively. In both trials, all \nthe patients tolerated the transplantation well until the \nend of the follow-up period. MSC infusion is conveni\ufffeent for patients with HBV-related ACLF and significantly \nincreases the survival rate by improving liver function \nand decreasing the incidence of severe infections [15, 16].\nIn addition to hepatitis B, hepatitis C is also a major \nform of viral hepatitis that has a very high incidence in \nEgypt. Therefore, a research institute in Egypt reported \na trial that used autologous MSC-derived hepatocyte-like \ncells for end-stage liver failure therapy. The transplanta\ufffetion group showed improved liver function, including \nincreases in serum albumin, Child–Pugh scores, MELD \nscores, and performance status, versus the controls [17]. \nAdditionally, for patients with HCV-related end-stage \nliver disease, another study in Egypt provided evidence \nthat administration of MSCs followed by granulocyte col\ufffeony stimulating factor (GCSF) mobilization is excellent \nfor liver stem cell therapy to retain liver mass and restore \nliver functions [18]. In summary, the above large con\ufffetrolled trials demonstrated that MSCs play a supportive \nrole in the treatment of liver failure and show satisfactory \ntolerability and beneficial effects on liver synthetic func\ufffetions and hepatic fibrosis resolution.\nMSC therapy for\xa0complications of\xa0liver transplantation\nOrthotopic liver transplantation is the only curative \nmeasure for patients with end-stage liver failure. How\ufffeever, the risk of complications after liver transplantation \nis still high, even with increases in surgical expertise. \nTwo of the most common complications following liver \ntransplant are rejection and infection. MSCs offer new \ntherapeutic opportunities to prevent and treat solid \norgan transplant rejection. A recent pilot study demon\ufffestrated that UC-MSC therapy can alleviate liver dam\ufffeage and improve allograft histology in liver transplant \npatients with acute graft rejection who did not respond \nto immunosuppressive agent dose adjustments. However, \nthe study was not carried out long enough to determine \nwhether decreased infection resulted from MSC infusion \n[19].\nHowever, in the same year, Detry et\xa0al. [20] enrolled \n10 liver transplant patients to receive MSCs infu\ufffesion and another 10 patients acted as controls. It was \nshown that no difference in the overall rates of rejec\ufffetion or graft survival was observed between the MSC \ninfusion group and the control group. And Month-6 \nbiopsies did not demonstrate a difference between \ngroups. The study indicated that the immunosuppres\ufffesion weaning in MSC recipients was not successful. \nThe results are completely different and contradictory \ncompared to those of the above pilot study. We ana\ufffelyze that the possible reason might be that the aim and \nexperimental design of the two studies were different. \nThe pilot study aimed to examine the clinical feasibil\ufffeity of MSC infusion as a therapeutic option for liver \nallograft rejection, and all patients were treated with \n\nYang\xa0et\xa0al. Cell Biosci (2020) 10:123 Page 8 of 18\nconventional immunosuppressive agents in both the \nexperimental and control groups, showing the sup\ufffeportive effect of MSC infusion. The study reported by \nDetry et\xa0al. aimed to evaluate the feasibility and toler\ufffeability of a single infusion of MSCs in liver transplant \nrecipients, and progressive immunosuppressive with\ufffedrawal was attempted in stable patients who received \nMSCs, which ultimately failed to promote tolerance. \nTherefore, we speculate that perhaps in the presence \nof immunosuppressive agents, MSCs can enhance the \noverall immunosuppressive effect; when the immuno\ufffesuppressive agents are withdrawn, MSCs cannot serve \nalone as an alternative treatment. Another reason for \nthis may be that the enrolled patients in the two studies \nwere not truly similar. In the pilot study, the patients \nwere considered suitable if their liver function did not \nrespond to adjustment of immunosuppressive agents. \nThese patients may be more sensitive to MSC applica\ufffetion. Therefore, in the clinical application of MSCs, not \nonly the use of an appropriate disease type but also the \nuse of appropriate enrolled patients and a reasonable \nexperimental protocol design should be considered.\nBesides, 56 establishment of practical applications of \nMSCs involve clinical trials to investigate their thera\ufffepeutic potential for treatment of liver disease, which \nalso almost including decompensated liver cirrhosis, \nliver failure and complications after liver transplan\ufffetation, according to ClinicalTrials.gov (Fig.\xa0 2b). And \nBased on the data from the published clinical trials \nwe discussed above, combined with the relevant basic \nresearch we have carried out and some of the currently \napproved MSC-based products for clinical applications, \nwe believe that MSCs are likely to be more effective in \nthe treatment of inflammation-related liver diseases \nand liver transplant rejection complications.\nPreparation and\xa0engraftment of\xa0MSCs\nSources of\xa0MSCs\nMesenchymal stem cells were first obtained from bone \nmarrow (BM) in 1970 [21], and they are now found to \nreside in various tissues apart from BM, including adi\ufffepose tissue [22], umbilical cord (UC) [23], umbilical cord \nblood [24], placenta [25], amniotic fluid [26], amniotic \nmembrane [27], dental pulp [28], synovium [29], periph\ufffeeral blood, liver, lung [30], skeletal muscle [31, 32], hair \nfollicles [33] and many others. Currently, MSCs applied \nfor liver disease treatment in the clinic are isolated mostly \nfrom the umbilical cord and bone marrow, and in only a \nfew cases adipose and menstrual\xa0 blood-derived MSCs \nhave been used (Fig.\xa0 3a). This is probably because BM\ufffeMSCs and UC-MSCs are most thoroughly studied types \nof cells, and BM and UC are relatively easy to obtain. \nHowever, there is still no definite standard for which \nsource of MSCs should be used for clinical application. \nMany factors should be considered.\nBM-MSCs are most suitable for autologous transplan\ufffetation. However, BM-MSCs have several limitations that \nshould be considered. First, the invasive isolation method \nis a risk to patients, even to healthy donors, because inva\ufffesion causes an injury that could lead to inflammation. \nThe proportion of MSCs in bone marrow is not always \nvery high, and they are difficult to proliferate in\xa0 vitro \n[34]. In addition, fresh bone marrow from young donors \nis very limited. Most BM-MSC injections involve autolo\ufffegous transplantation in the clinic. Thus, the condition of \npatients also limits the number and potential of MSCs. \nFor instance, age-related declines in proliferation and dif\ufffeferentiation may weaken the therapeutic effect of MSCs \n[35].\nHowever, UC-MSCs have many advantages. The iso\ufffelation process used to obtain MSCs from UC does not \ncause damage, and it allows for utilization of tissue that \nFig. 3 The number and percentage of MSC based clinical trials classified by sources (a) and transplantation routes (b) of MSCs\n\nYang\xa0et\xa0al. Cell Biosci (2020) 10:123 Page 9 of 18\nmight otherwise have been thrown away. It has been \nreported that the proliferation ability of UC-MSCs is \nmuch higher than that of BM-MSCs, [36] which fulfills \nthe need for the large quantities required in the clinic. UC \nis at an early phase of organic development, so UC-MSCs \nshow higher self-renewal and differentiation capacity \n[37]. Thus, there is no need to be concerned about age\uffferelated issues. On the other hand, UC-MSCs are better \nfor liver failure treatment because of higher differentia\ufffetion capacity. In addition, it has been demonstrated that \nthe immunogenicity of UC-MSCs is lower than that of \nBM-MSCs [38, 39]. Thus, for patients with liver trans\ufffeplantation, autologous BM-MSCs and allogenic UC\ufffeMSCs are more appropriate. Adipose tissue is also easy to \nobtain, and the isolation method is very simple. However, \nAD-MSCs have been shown to have poor proliferation \nand self-renewal ability. Their anti-inflammatory ability \nis lower than that of BM-MSCs [40]. In conclusion, UC\ufffeMSCs are a prominent and preferred candidate for clini\ufffecal application.\nDuring clinical treatment, the choice between autolo\ufffegous or allogeneic transplantation is a source of confu\ufffesion for doctors. For autologous transplantation, the type \nand amounts of MSC-derived tissues are very limited. \nTherefore, it will take a long time to obtain a sufficient \nnumber of MSCs for transplantation. The wait for cells \nmight cause doctors to miss the window for treatment \nfor liver diseases such as liver failure and acute liver fail\ufffeure. Obviously, the process of obtaining tissue also causes \ninjury to patients. On the other hand, due to their lower \nimmunogenicity, allogeneic MSCs can be injected with\ufffeout rejection risk, and an enough MSCs can be obtained \nvery quickly. We can also choose the MSCs with the best \nproperties. Therefore, allogeneic MSCs may be much \nbetter than autologous MSCs.\nRoutes of\xa0MSC transplantation\nIn clinical trials, MSCs have been transplanted into \npatients via various available routes; most are trans\ufffeplanted by intravenous injection, followed by intrahe\ufffepatic injection (including via the portal vein and hepatic \nartery), and the least used method is intrasplenic injec\ufffetion (Fig.\xa03b). Which route is the best and most beneficial \nfor therapy? How can the best route be chosen from all \nroutes? It is indeed necessary to explore this question.\nThere are only a few completed clinical trials that have \nused multiple infusion routes simultaneously. In one \nclinical trial that used BM-MSCs to treat end-stage liver \nfailure that was performed in Egypt, MSCs were injected \ninto patients by the portal vein and intrasplenic injec\ufffetion, and the effects of these two injection routes for \n6\xa0months after transplantation were compared [17]. As a \nresult, it was found that portal vein injection was more \neffective than intrasplenic injection, as indicated by the \nfatigue impact scale and MELD score. However, this \neffect was observed only in the first month, and the dif\ufffeference disappeared in the following days. This suggests \nthat portal injection favors faster engraftment of injected \ncells but does not affect the total number of engrafted \ncells. Splenic injection is much easier than intrahepatic \ninjection technically. However, we need to consider the \ncomplications induced by intrasplenic injection. Seventy \npercent of patients with intrasplenic injection had fever \nafter cell transplantation, and 30% of patients had fever \nafter intrahepatic injection. Thus, we prefer portal vein \ninjection between these two injection routes.\nApart from portal vein injection, the hepatic artery can \nbe used for intrahepatic injection. Hepatic artery injec\ufffetion is used more often than portal vein injection dur\ufffeing MSC transplantation in clinical trials. However, is \nhepatic artery injection better than portal vein injection? \nSang et\xa0al. concluded that intraportal injection was better \nfor repairing liver injury in swine with ALF than hepatic \nintra-arterial injection, peripheral intravenous injection \nand in\xa0 situ intrahepatic injection, as indicated by the \nincrease in survival time and the decrease in liver injury \n[41]. Another study showed that transplantation via the \nhepatic artery was not beneficial for the transdifferentia\ufffetion of MSCs.\nIntravenous injection is the most popular route for \nclinical therapy because of its convenience. Is it the opti\ufffemal method for cell transplantation? We must look for \nevidence from preclinical trials because there are no \nclinical trials comparing the effectiveness of intravenous \ninjection and other routes. Animal studies have shown \nthat cells transplanted via intravenous injection will accu\ufffemulate in the lung. E. Eggenhofer demonstrated that in \nthe first few hours, 60% of MSCs injected intravenously \naccumulated in the lungs and did not move to the liver \nafterward. These cells were probably cleared by immune \ncells [42]. Higashimoto et\xa0 al. [43] showed that, after \nintravenous injection in mice with ConA induced hepa\ufffetitis, GFP-labeled MSCs were found only in the lung but \nnot in the liver. Cao et\xa0al. [44] determined that intrapor\ufffetal injection of MSCs restored hepatic function in ALF \npigs, while transplantation of MSCs via the jugular vein \ndid not. Li et\xa0 al. [45] also administered MSCs via the \nperipheral vein and intraportal route into ALF pigs. They \nreported that the injection of MSCs via a peripheral vein \ndid not rescue ALF pigs, while most of the ALF pigs sur\ufffevived for over 6\xa0months after transplantation of MSCs via \nintraportal injection.\nIntraportal injection is obviously the optimal route \nfor MSC transplantation to treat liver diseases because \nof faster engraftment and the avoidance of off-target \naccumulation. In fact, we must evaluate the condition of \n\nYang\xa0et\xa0al. Cell Biosci (2020) 10:123 Page 10 of 18\npatients and the potential risk of using a specific route \nbefore choosing the injection route. For instance, we need \nto know if there is thrombosis in the portal vein or tech\ufffenical issues. If there are difficulties involved in intraportal \ninjection, intrasplenic injection or intravenous injection \nis probably a widely accepted\xa0 alternative\xa0 approach, and \nmore MSCs are suggested to be prepared.\nDoses used for\xa0MSC transplantation\nThe doses of MSCs applied in clinical therapy were not \nexact. It is very difficult to assess an optimal dosing \nstrategy for MSC transplantation because most of the \nrecent clinical trials were aimed at observing the effi\ufffeciency of MSC therapy but did not determine the opti\ufffemal dose. Even so, we can still provide some guidance \nbased on these clinical trials. Most clinical trials apply \nMSCs according to the body weight of patients (n=9, \n0.5–3×106\n/kg as a single dose), while others apply MSCs \naccording to the total quantity of cells (n=7, 1–20×107\n). \nAccording to other medicine dosing strategies, injection \naccording to body weight may be more reasonable. An \nEgypt study in 2013 involving transplanting MSCs into \npatients with liver cirrhosis showed that as few as 1×107\nMSCs were effective for 6\xa0 months without any side \neffects [46]. In the same year, another study used MSCs \nin patients with liver cirrhosis and found that 2×108\nMSCs showed no significant effect after 12\xa0months com\ufffepared with placebo [8]. However, there are other effec\ufffetive clinical trials that used more than 2×108\n MSCs. It \nis important to bear in mind that we cannot draw a con\ufffeclusion from different trials. There are other parameters \ninvolved in this process, such as the condition of patients, \nprogression of diseases and treatment regimens. Among \nthe recent clinical trials involving applying MSCs to \ntreat liver diseases, the total number of MSCs used was \nfrom~107\n−\u2009\u2009~109\n, regardless of which method was cho\ufffesen to deliver the dose. The large range of doses used is \nhard to explain because there are few studies involving \ncomparisons of different doses in the same clinical trial. \nHowever, we know that as few as 1×107\n cells can be \nhelpful.\nMost completed clinical trials injected MSCs only \nonce, and others injected MSCs multiple times, with \nup to 9 injections in one experiment [ClinicalTrials.gov\nNCT02223897]. How long would one dose of MSCs be \neffective? Is it necessary to inject MSCs several times? \nOne study that used MSCs for liver cirrhosis treatment \nshowed that MSCs could improve liver function over two \nyears. No difference was observed between the control \ngroup and MSC group after two years [17]. As a result, \nthe effect of one injection will not last that long. How\ufffeever, another clinical trial involving treatment for liver \ncirrhosis showed that there was no significant difference \nbetween the effect of one or two injections during a year \n[10]. This is probably because the second injection was \nperformed only one month after the first injection. From \nthese two studies, we can conclude that a longer interval \nfor the second injection is probably beneficial for improv\ufffeing the therapeutic efficiency of MSCs.\nMechanism of\xa0MSC therapy for\xa0liver disease\nIn order to elucidate how MSCs play a positive role in the \ntreatment of the above-mentioned liver diseases, we pre\ufffesent the current findings regarding the molecular mecha\ufffenism involved in the MSC-dependent modulation of liver \ndiseases via a brief overview. A large number of stud\ufffeies have reported that MSC transplantation could pro\ufffemote partial recovery of liver function and alleviate liver \ninflammation in several animal models of liver fibrosis \nor cirrhosis. The mechanisms of the effects of MSCs on \ntreating liver diseases have been evaluated from various \nperspectives in basic studies.\nImmunomodulation capacity of\xa0MSCs\nMost previous studies have shown that MSCs could \nimprove or repair injured tissue by modulating tissue \nimmune responses through direct cell-to-cell interaction \nor paracrine secretion. MSCs could modulate innate and \nadaptive immune responses.\nThe induction of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+\xa0 regulatory T \ncells (Tregs)\xa0is critical for\xa0MSC-mediated immunomod\ufffeulation. Previous studies indicated that an imbalance in \nTreg/Th17 cells may be associated with liver diseases, \nsuch as autoimmune hepatitis, chronic hepatitis B, and \nalcoholic liver disease. A random trial reported that com\ufffepared with those in the control group, the serum levels \nof interleukin-17 (IL-17), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF\ufffeα), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were significantly lower in \nthe transplantation group. Furthermore, a significant \nincrease in Tregs and a marked decrease in Th17 cells \nwere observed in the transplantation group, indicat\ufffeing that BM-MSCs exhibit potent immunosuppressive \nand anti-inflammatory effects through the regulation of \nserum levels of inflammatory cytokines [6]. In line with \nthe above study, Shi et\xa0al. [19] reported a pilot study using \nMSCs for treating liver transplant recipients. The data \nshowed that after MSC infusion, Tregs in the liver were \nupregulated, whereas Th17 cells were downregulated. \nThey also found that the percentage of HLA-DR+ CD4+\nT cells was significantly decreased after UC-MSC infu\ufffesions, which may facilitate the suppression of alloreac\ufffetive responses. To date, only a few clinical protocols have \nincluded ex\xa0 vivo immunologic studies to gain insight \ninto the mechanistic effects of MSC therapy in liver dis\ufffeease. There is an increasingly large body of work that \nsupports the immunoregulatory capacity of transferred \n\nYang\xa0et\xa0al. Cell Biosci (2020) 10:123 Page 11 of 18\nMSCs in rodent models of liver disease. In nonclini\ufffecal experiments, several different molecules secreted by \nMSCs have been reported to have an immunomodula\ufffetory effect on T cell activities, including inducible nitric \noxide synthase (iNOS), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), \nprostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and transforming growth fac\ufffetor (TGF)-β [47, 48]. Another study demonstrated that \nMSCs can secrete matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), \nsuch as MMP-2 and MMP-9, that suppress T cell activa\ufffetion by cleaving surface CD25 molecules on T cells [49]. \nFurthermore, MSCs have also been shown to promote \nthe generation and development of Tregs by secreting \nTGF-β. Of note, TGF-β is a two-edged sword in that it \nhas immunosuppressive effects that alleviate liver inflam\ufffemation [50] but can also promote the progression of liver \nfibrosis [51, 52].\nIn addition, MSCs are reported to exhibit immu\ufffenomodulatory effects in macrophages, which play a cen\ufffetral role in both fibrosis and fibrotic resolution in the \nliver. Watanabe et\xa0al. found that MSCs could change the \npolarity of macrophages toward an M2 anti-inflamma\ufffetory phenotype, which involves the secretion of various \nanti-inflammatory factors, including chemokine ligand \n1 (CCL-1) and IL-10, increases the production of matrix \nmetalloproteinases to decrease ECM, and increases the \nphagocytosis of hepatocyte debris (during this process, \nmacrophages increase the levels of pro-regenerative fac\ufffetors) [53]. Similar to the above study, murine adipose\ufffederived MSCs were found to significantly increase the \nproportion of M2-like cells by increasing the production \nof IL-10 and arginase 1 activity [54]. In a mouse model \nof ischemia/reperfusion (IR)-induced\xa0 sterile inflamma\ufffetory injury of the liver, we found that adoptive transfer of \nMSCs reduced hepatocellular damage and shifted\xa0 mac\uffferophage\xa0 polarization from the M1 to M2 phenotype by \nincreasing YAP and β-catenin nuclear translation in mac\uffferophages. Further research found that MSCs enhance the \nactivity of\xa0the macrophage\xa0Hippo pathway, which in turn \ncontrols NLRP3 activation through a direct interaction \nbetween YAP and β-catenin and regulates XBP1-medi\ufffeated NLRP3 activation, leading to reprogramming\xa0 of \nmacrophage\xa0 polarization toward an anti-inflammatory \nM2 phenotype [55].\nDirect and\xa0indirect effects of\xa0MSCs on\xa0the\xa0fate of\xa0activated \nHSCs\nInflammation and fibrosis have a very close relation\ufffeship in liver disease. When the liver is damaged, quies\ufffecent hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) transdifferentiate into \nproliferative myofibroblastic/activated HSCs, which \nare the main contributors to liver fibrosis. Investigators \nhave tried to determine the methods by which MSCs \nmay influence the fate of myofibroblasts/activated HSCs. \nReported hypotheses include a direct effect by cell–cell \ncontact and MSC-secreted cytokines/growth factors \nor an indirect effect by cellular mediators, such as mac\uffferophages or even hepatocytes. Regarding the indirect \neffects, MSCs can regulate the activities of HSCs by \nmodulating immune cell activity. For example, MSCs can \ninduce changes in the cytokine profile of activated mac\uffferophages by increasing the production of IL-10, PGE2 \nand matrix metalloproteinases and thereby promote \nthe resolution of fibrosis [56]. On the other hand, MSCs \ncan degrade ECM directly by secreting matrix metallo\ufffeproteinases, such as MMP-13 and MMP-9 [57]. In\xa0vitro \nexperiments have also demonstrated that after coculture \nwith MSCs, the proliferation and activation of HSCs was \ninhibited by ADSCs, and the apoptosis of HSCs was pro\ufffemoted [58, 59]. Furthermore, a recent study reported that \ntumor necrosis factor-inducible gene 6 protein (TSG\ufffe6), a cytokine released from MSCs, could suppress HSC \nactivation and induce the expression of stem cell mark\ufffeers in these cells. Then, the stem cell-like cells derived \nfrom HSCs treated with TSG-6 can form organoids that \ncontribute to liver regeneration [60]. The milk fat glob\ufffeule-EGF factor 8 (MFGE8) was identified by Su et\xa0al. [61] \nas a novel key antifibrotic factor based on its role in the \nmodulation of TGF-β signaling. In an in\xa0vivo analysis of \nmice, hUC-MSC secretomes were injected into mice with \nfibrosis, which led to a significant inhibition of liver fibro\ufffesis. MFGE8 is an antifibrotic protein in MSC secretomes \nthat strongly inhibits TGF-β signaling and reduces extra\ufffecellular matrix deposition and\xa0liver\xa0fibrosis\xa0in\xa0mice [62].\nDifferentiation of\xa0MSCs into\xa0Hepatocyte‑like Cells\nA majority of in\xa0vitro studies demonstrated that MSCs \nhad the capacity to differentiate into hepatocyte-like \ncells with liver-specific morphology and function \nwith the help of specific growth factors, such as HGF, \nEGF, FGF, and OSM [63–66]. Furthermore, Yan et\xa0 al.\n[67] showed that by mimicking the microenvironment \nof liver fibrosis using 50\xa0 g/L rat fibrotic liver tissue \nextracts, hUC-MSCs were stimulated to differentiate \ninto hepatocyte-like cells in a shorter period of time. \nSimilar results have been confirmed by in\xa0vivo experi\ufffements. Interestingly, Park et\xa0 al. [68] previously trans\ufffeplanted human MSCs into rats with a fibrotic liver. \nThen, 21\xa0 days after transplantation, human albumin\ufffepositive cells were detected in the MSC infusion group, \nwhich suggested that the transplanted MSCs could dif\ufffeferentiate into albumin-secreting hepatocyte-like cells \nin the damaged livers of the rats. In line with these \nfindings, Zhang et\xa0al. [69] reported that the expression \nof human ALB, AFP, CK18 and CK19 were detected in \nthe liver tissue of fibrotic and cirrhotic rats after hUC\ufffeMSC transplantation, suggesting that transplanted \n\nYang\xa0et\xa0al. Cell Biosci (2020) 10:123 Page 12 of 18\nhUC-MSCs could migrate into the injured liver, where \nthey could differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells. Fur\ufffethermore, they also demonstrated that hUC-MSCs did \nnot directly differentiate into functional hepatocytes; \nthey first differentiated into epithelial cell-like cells and \nsubsequently differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells. \nAll the above findings indicated that MSCs could dif\ufffeferentiate into hepatocyte-like cells through exposure \nto the liver fibrosis microenvironment both in\xa0 vitro \nand in\xa0 vivo. However, there are also many research \nreports that indicate that the trans-differentiation of \nMSCs into hepatocytes has rarely been observed (less \nthan 1% of the total liver mass) in animal models after \nMSC infusion [70]. Similarly, menstrual blood-derived \nstem cells were demonstrated to improve liver func\ufffetion by eliminating collagen deposition and inhibiting \nproliferative HSCs via paracrine mediators, but few of \nthe transplanted cells were found to differentiate into \nfunctional hepatocyte-like cells [71]. Based on the \nabove studies, MSCs are believed to exhibit a positive \ntreatment effect in two ways: directly by cell differenti\ufffeation and indirectly by paracrine effects. Many studies \nhave attempted to use exosomes or culture superna\ufffetants of MSCs to achieve therapeutic effects [72–74], \nindicating that the success of MSC therapy does not \ncompletely correlate with the efficiency of cell engraft\ufffement and replacement. For treatment, it is likely that \nthe paracrine effects of MSCs play a more vital role. \nFurthermore, we believe that in some cases, alternative \ntreatments, such as MSC exosomes or MSC culture \nsupernatant therapy, may be more effective than treat\ufffement with MSCs themselves, as MSCs have robust \nplasticity, differentiation characteristics and immu\ufffenomodulatory properties. Infusion of MSCs in differ\ufffeent microenvironmental conditions may change their \nimmunoregulatory characteristics, thereby affecting \nthe stability of their therapeutic effects.\nIn conclusion, the treatment mechanisms mentioned \nabove do not necessarily appear in the process of treat\ufffeing the same disease at the same time. According to \nthe basic characteristics of different liver diseases, the \nrole of MSCs in the treatment process may be focusing \neffect. For example, in applying for treatment inflam\ufffemation related liver disease, such as hepatitis induced \ncirrhosis or complications of liver transplantation, \nthe immunomodulatory function of MSCs may play a \nmore vital role. However, for liver cirrhosis, the effects \nof MSCs on the fate of activated HSCs may also take \npart in the treatment process. In another hand, the \nefficacy of MSCs treatment in liver failure may mainly \ndepend on its property of differentiation into hepato\ufffecyte-like cells.\nModification of\xa0MSCs for\xa0therapy\nConventional unmanipulated MSCs have been the main\ufffestay of therapeutic studies, and more efforts need to be \nmade to enhance their efficacy. In fact, priming of MSCs \nbefore use is intended to enhance their biological prop\ufffeerties and function in some animal models. This may \ninvolve the combination of MSCs with other factors, pre\ufffetreatment and genetic modification of MSCs, and the use \nof secretomes of MSCs.\nPretreatment of\xa0MSCs\nPretreatment of MSCs may improve their potential to \ntreat liver diseases by increasing their homing, differen\ufffetiation and immunoregulation capacity. Pretreatment of \nMSCs with zeaxanthin dipalmitate (ZD) could increase \nthe cell survival rate and enhance the capacity of MSCs to \ndifferentiate into hepatocytes. In addition, ZD-pretreated \nMSCs ameliorated liver injury to a great extent [75]. The \nanti-inflammatory property of MSCs could be modulated \nby the inflammatory microenvironment. Thus, pretreat\ufffement with inflammatory factors such as TNF-α com\ufffebined with IFN-γ may promote the anti-inflammatory \nability of MSCs and shorten the functioning time in\xa0vivo \n[76]. However, the anti-inflammatory effect of MSCs \nis probably repressed after differentiation. Should we \nenhance the differentiation ability or immune regulation \nability of MSCs by priming? This may depend on the spe\ufffecific disease type. In addition to MSC priming, the pre\ufffetreatment of MSC recipients also exerted a similar effect \nin\xa0 vivo. Pretreatment of recipients with both anti-PMN \n[77] and IL-1β siRNA [78] could promote the therapeu\ufffetic efficacy of MSCs. Dexamethasone has been dem\ufffeonstrated to repress the repair capacity of MSCs [79]. \nThus, dexamethasone should be withdrawn before MSC \nadministration.\nGenetic modification of\xa0MSCs\nIn addition to MSC pretreatment, genetic modifica\ufffetion of MSCs may be another powerful approach for \ndisease therapy. To date, there have been many genetic \nmodifications targeting MSC therapy in animal mod\ufffeels. Both c-Met [80] and CXCR4 [81] overexpression \ncould enhance the migration and engraftment of MSCs \ninto injured sites and thus promote liver injury repair. \nIn addition to showing the enhancement of homing, \nIGF-1-modified MSCs were found to have an enhanced \nanti-fibrotic ability compared to normal MSCs [82]. In \nfact, a large proportion of gene modifications of MSCs \nhave been applied in liver cancer treatment. MSCs \ncan deliver cytokines, such as IFN-β [83, 84], IFN-α2b \n[85], tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis induc\ufffeing ligand (TRAIL) [86, 87] and IL-12 [88], to inhibit \n\nYang\xa0et\xa0al. Cell Biosci (2020) 10:123 Page 13 of 18\nhepatocarcinogenesis. MSCs also deliver the immune \neffector molecule CD3scfv to stimulate antitumor immu\ufffenity [89]. In addition, MSCs can deliver the suicide gene \nHSV-Tk to induce cytotoxicity in hepatoma cells [90]. \nOverall, MSC-delivered cytokines could be more sta\ufffeble and longer lasting than pure cytokines and produce \nreduced side effects. Moreover, the use of genetically \nmodified MSCs would be more safe than transfecting \nviruses directly into the body. However, considering the \npotential of MSCs to promote tumor growth, a safety \nevaluation should be carried out strictly before clinical \napplication.\nCell‑free therapy with\xa0MSCs\nThe status of transplanted cells in\xa0vivo and the potential \ntumorigenic risks of MSCs have raised concerns about \ntheir effectiveness and safety. MSCs have been shown \nto exert their anti-inflammatory and tissue repair func\ufffetions through the paracrine effects of cytokines and other \nsecretomes. As a result, increasing evidence has con\ufffefirmed the efficacy of conditioned medium (CM) and \nexosomes of MSCs in animal models of liver disease. \nMSC-CM exerts anti-inflammatory functions via pro\ufffeduction of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10, \nIL-13, and IL-27 [91], and contributes to the expansion of \nimmune-suppressive T cells (Tregs) [92]. MSC-CM also \nrestored liver function by promoting hepatocyte pro\ufffeliferation and inhibiting hepatocyte apoptosis through \nHGF and VEGF secretion [93]. Moreover, Li et\xa0 al. [72] \nfound that UC-MSC-derived exosomes inhibited liver \nfibrosis by repressing EMT of hepatocytes and collagen \nproduction in a mouse model. Exosomes also inactivate \nthe TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway, which is involved \nin fibrogenesis. On the other hand, miRNAs in exosomes \ncontribute to inhibiting fibrosis formation [94]. Thus, \nthe use of the MSC secretome as an acellular therapeu\ufffetic agent could provide several advantages over the use of \ncell-based therapies for liver diseases.\nProspective of\xa0clinical application of\xa0MSCs\nMSC therapy has been generally regarded as a safe and \npromising therapeutic strategy in clinical trials for \npatients with liver disease, including complications due \nto liver transplantation, liver failure, cirrhosis due to alco\ufffehol, HBV, or HCV, and primary biliary cholangitis. How\ufffeever, the application of MSCs for the treatment of related \ndiseases has not been approved by official agencies such \nas the FDA, and this therapeutic strategy has not been as \npopular as expected. We speculate that this is probably \nbecause there are still some vital problems that have not \nbeen solved in the application of MSC therapy (Fig.\xa0 4). \nIn addition, the inconsistency and ambiguity of MSCs as \na type of stem cells may be one of the main reasons for \nthe limited application of MSCs. The creator of the term \n""MSC"", Arnold Caplan, recommended using ""Medicinal \nSignaling Cells"" instead of ""Mesenchymal stem cells"" to \nbest describe these cells [95]. MSCs have been found as \nstem cells at first because of their self-renewal and multi\ufffedifferentiation. However, their application will be greatly \nlimited if we treat MSCs only as stem cells. MSCs also \nhave some properties beyond stemness, such as migrat\ufffeing to injury sites and immunoregulation. These prop\ufffeerties are important for liver disease therapy. Balancing \ndifferent views of using MSCs as stem cells or other cell \ntype will improve application of MSCs in liver disease \ntherapy.\nFirst, it is important to maintain the quality and stabil\ufffeity of MSCs used for disease therapy. Based on the clini\ufffecal trials mentioned above, there is no uniform standard \nfor evaluating the quality of MSCs in each trial. The char\ufffeacteristics of MSCs from autologous bone marrow from \ndifferent patients are likely to be quite different due to \nthe diversity of factors such as patient age, gender, dis\ufffeease status, and other factors. For instance, a researcher \nin Brazil reported that MSCs isolated from multiple scle\uffferosis patients have distinct gene expression profiles and \nfunctional defects implicated in MSC immunomodula\ufffetory and immunosuppressive activity compared with \nthose from their healthy counterparts [96]. Another \ngroup also demonstrated that MSCs derived from hepa\ufffetitis B patients proliferated slowly and tended to undergo \nsenescence [97]. Therefore, we believe that the establish\ufffement of a complete MSC quality standard evaluation sys\ufffetem is needed. Based on such a standard, we can know \nwhich MSCs from autologous patients are qualified or \nmeet the standards and which should be eliminated and \nreplaced with allogenic MSCs for treatment.\nFor the treatment of disease, the optimal dose of \nMSCs and the number of infusions is not well defined. \nTo date, a very few articles have examined how many \ndoses of MSCs could produce the best effect and \nwhether transplanting more MSCs results in a better \ntreatment effect. Therefore, we also have no idea what \nthe optimal number of injections and interval times \nwould be. By integrating data from the different clinical \ntrials mentioned above, we believe that MSCs should \nbe effective when the number of administered MSCs is \nwithin a certain range. Freshly isolated MSCs showed \nbetter homing than cultured cells [98]. Thus, the most \nsuitable dose should be determined based on balanc\ufffeing the corresponding therapeutic effect and the time \nand economic costs required to obtain the correspond\ufffeing dose of MSCs. Furthermore, as we mentioned in the \nthird part of the review, it is not effective to perform \nmultiple repeated MSC injections in a short period of \ntime, such as within 6\xa0months. In conclusion, low doses \n\nYang\xa0et\xa0al. Cell Biosci (2020) 10:123 Page 14 of 18\nand multiple injections with longer intervals are proba\ufffebly the most effective and economical strategy for MSC \napplication.\nJudging from the large number of in\xa0 vivo studies of \nMSCs, regardless of whether MSCs were obtained from \nautologous or allogenic sources or from bone mar\uffferow, umbilical cord or fat, MSC therapy did not cause \nserious adverse reactions, tumor formation or trans\ufffeplant-related deaths in clinical trials. Thus, the source \nof MSCs that should be used depends on the specific \nsituation. For instance, allogeneic MSCs, compared \nwith autologous MSCs, have more potential advantages \nfor the treatment of ACLF. Because a characteristic \nof ACLF is its rapid progression, the use of allogeneic \nMSCs may be preferred because of their immediate \navailability, while it always needs to take longer time \nfor culturing autologous MSCs to obtain a sufficient \nquantity.\nOf note, another central issue for the future success of \ncell transplantation is the ability to noninvasively assess \nthe fate, migration patterns, and survival of trans\ufffeplanted cells. If we can track the fate of the transplanted \nMSCs, we could know the proportion of cells that home \nin and engraft in the liver and the way that cells exert \ntheir therapeutic effects. The classic method of MSCs \nlabelling uses retroviral vectors to express fluorescent \nprotein or gene-modified animal models to track MSCs \nin\xa0vivo [99, 100]. However, the visualization of cells that \nhome in in different organs requires sacrificing of the \nanimal, as the tissue penetrability of fluorescence is \nFig. 4 Concerns of MSC therapy for liver disease from bench to bedside\n\nYang\xa0et\xa0al. Cell Biosci (2020) 10:123 Page 15 of 18\nlimited. Therefore, these technologies are not suitable \nfor clinical applications. More noninvasive techniques \nhave been employed constantly. Endomicroscopy was \nreported as a clinically available noninvasive cellular \ntracking method used to track cell fate in\xa0 vivo [101]. \nFurthermore, cellular magnetic resonance imaging \n(MRI) using fluorine- or iron-based nanoemulsions is \nalso regarded as a great means to detect transplanted \ncells in\xa0vivo because of its high specificity and precise \nquantification [102, 103]. However, the potential limita\ufffetions of these tracking tools are the possibility of trans\ufffeferring the label to local bystander cells and the effect \nof the label on MSC basic feature. More advanced and \nimproved technology for transplanted cell tracking \nneeds to be employed.\nConclusions\nAccording to clinical trials, MSC therapy has been \nregarded as a safe and promising therapeutic strategy for \npatients with end-stage liver disease, including liver cir\uffferhosis, liver failure, and complications after liver trans\ufffeplantation. However, for MSCs to become a routine \ntreatment for these liver diseases and to be widely used, \nfurther studies with larger samples and double-blind con\ufffetrolled trials are needed to increase the safety and effi\ufffecacy of MSCs in the clinic. Furthermore, studies on the \noptimal MSC transplantation route, minimum effective \nnumber of MSCs, and tracking of MSCs are needed to \nprovide more references and guidance for specific future \nclinical treatment programs. In addition to the use of \nconventional unmanipulated MSCs, derived MSC thera\ufffepies, such as the use of primed MSCs or gene-modified \nMSCs or cell-free therapy, may be promising and practi\ufffecal treatments in the future.\nAbbreviations\nMSCs: Mesenchymal stem cells; LC: Liver cirrhosis; MELD score: Model for end\ufffestage liver disease scores; ACLF: Acute-on-chronic liver failure; GCSF: Granulo\ufffecyte colony stimulating factor; BM: Bone marrow; ALF: Acute liver failure; UC: \nUmbilical cord; AD: Adipose tissue; IL-17: Interleukin-17; TNF-α: Tumor necrosis \nfactor-α; IL-6: Interleukin-6; iNOS: Inducible nitric oxide synthase; HGF: Hepato\ufffecyte growth factor; PGE2: Prostaglandin E2; TGF: Transforming growth factor; \nMMPs: Matrix metalloproteinases; CCL-1: Chemokine ligand 1; IR: Ischemia/\nreperfusion; HSCs: Hepatic stellate cells; TSG-6: Tumor necrosis factor-inducible \ngene 6 protein; MFGE8: Milk fat globule-EGF factor 8; ZD: Zeaxanthin dipal\ufffemitate; TRAIL: Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand; CM: \nConditioned medium.\nAcknowledgements\nThis manuscript was edited by one or more of the highly qualified native \nEnglish-speaking editors at American Journal Experts (certificate verification \nkey: E53E-CABE-7BDF-5D05-B576).\nAuthors’ contributions\nLXW and CZ formulated the idea.

The article highlights the importance of understanding the optimal dose, route, frequency, and duration of MSC administration for each specific liver disorder. The authors suggest that future clinical trials should focus on addressing these gaps in knowledge through rigorous design and execution. They also emphasize the need for standardizing MSC characterization and quality control measures to ensure safety and efficacy. Overall, the article calls for continued research and development of MSC-based therapies for liver diseases.

Here is a brief overview of some of the studies mentioned in the article:

- A phase II clinical trial found that a single intravenous injection of autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative liver dysfunction in patients undergoing liver resection.
- Another study demonstrated that MSCs can promote liver regeneration in rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury.
- A randomized controlled trial showed that MSCs can improve liver function and reduce inflammation in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.
- A study comparing MSCs from healthy individuals and patients with hepatitis B found that the latter had lower suppressive function, suggesting a potential role for MSCs in the pathogenesis of liver disease.
- A phase III clinical trial found that MSCs could prevent recurrence of primary biliary cirrhosis when administered via the hepatic artery.
- A study using endomicrosopy detected labeled MSCs in rat colitis models, providing insight into the fate of injected MSCs.
- A systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that MSCs can improve liver function and reduce inflammation in patients with liver cirrhosis.
- A phase I clinical trial investigating the use of MSCs for ischemic-type biliary lesions following liver transplantation found positive results.

Overall, the studies reviewed in the article suggest that MSCs hold promise as a therapeutic option for liver diseases, although further research is needed to optimize dosing, routing, frequency, and duration of administration for each specific condition. Additionally, standardization of MSC characterization and quality control measures is necessary to ensure safety and efficacy.",0.5882352941176471,0.8319896825573222,FULL_PAPER

Here we report the VITTAL clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov\nnumber NCT02740608) outcomes, using normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) to\nobjectively assess livers discarded by all UK centres meeting specific high-risk criteria. Thirty\ufffeone livers were enroled and assessed by viability criteria based on the lactate clearance to\nlevels ≤2.5 mmol/L within 4 h. The viability was achieved by 22 (71%) organs, that were\ntransplanted after a median preservation time of 18 h, with 100% 90-day survival. During the\nmedian follow up of 542 days, 4 (18%) patients developed biliary strictures requiring re\ufffetransplantation. This trial demonstrates that viability testing with NMP is feasible and in this\nstudy enabled successful transplantation of 71% of discarded livers, with 100% 90-day\npatient and graft survival; it does not seem to prevent non-anastomotic biliary strictures in\nlivers donated after circulatory death with prolonged warm ischaemia.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16251-3 OPEN\n1 Liver Unit, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHBFT), Birmingham, UK. 2National Institute for Health\nResearch (NIHR), Birmingham Biomedical Research Centre, University of Birmingham and University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust,\nBirmingham, UK. 3 Centre for Liver and Gastrointestinal Research, Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK. 4 Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK. 5D3B team, Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, University of\nBirmingham, Birmingham, UK. 6Department of Cellular Pathology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust\n(UHBFT), Birmingham, UK. 7Department of Intensive Care Medicine, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK. 8 OrganOx Limited, Oxford, UK. 9Nuffield\nDepartment of Surgical Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. 10 Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK. 11These\nauthors contributed equally: Hynek Mergental, Richard W.

The incidence of liver disease\nhas risen by 500% over the last 4 decades, however, access to\ntransplantation is limited by the shortage of donor organs1. As a\nconsequence, 240 patients (19%) waiting for liver transplantation\nin the United Kingdom either died or were removed from the\nwaiting list in 2016–20172. Data from the United States shows a\nsimilar pattern, comprising 32% of those listed for transplant\n(3629 patients) within 3 years of listing2,3. The demand for liver\ngrafts has driven the wider use of extended criteria donors4.\nHowever, these are associated with an increased risk of primary\nnon-function or delayed failure5–9, and the acceptance of these\nhigher-risk organs varies widely10. Because of these inferior\noutcomes, and the difficulty of predicting organ viability, many\npotential donor organs remain unutilised. The high waiting list\nmortality justifies the utilisation of more marginal grafts, but\ncurrent practice requires risk mitigation by matching high-risk\nlivers to lower-risk recipients to achieve patient survival rates that\nare acceptable11. Furthermore, the determination of suitability of\na graft for transplantation largely depends on a surgeon’s sub\ufffejective assessment of the graft’s appearance, using criteria that are\nknown to be unreliable12.\nOrgan preservation currently relies upon cooling to ice tem\ufffeperature to reduce cellular metabolism, and infusing specialist\nsolutions to limit cellular damage. Oxygen deprivation and accu\ufffemulation of by-products of anaerobic metabolism limit the dura\ufffetion of storage and result in ischaemia–reperfusion injury at the\ntime of implantation. This process is more severe in marginal\norgans13. Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) has been\nshown to reduce preservation-related graft injury compared to\nstatic cold storage in transplantable livers, according to current\nselection criteria, in a prospective European trial, which also\ndemonstrated increased utilisation of organs14. In NMP, the liver is\nsupplied with oxygen, nutrients and medication at physiological\ntemperature and pressures, maintaining conditions that support\nhomoeostasis, normal metabolic activity and objective assessment\nof function in real-time. Experimental data have shown that end\ufffeischaemic NMP facilitates replenishment of adenosine tripho\ufffesphate and glycogen levels. Based on increasing clinical experience,\nviability criteria have emerged; these are objective parameters,\nmeasurable during NMP15. Whilst the feasibility of this approach\nhas been demonstrated in a proof-of-concept series, it has not been\nvalidated in a rigorous clinical trial16,17.\nWe therefore conducted this prospective, non-randomised,\nadaptive phase 2 trial in a large single centre, to evaluate the\npotential of NMP to provide objective assessment of the viability\nof livers currently deemed unsuitable for transplantation, and to\ntransplant those that met predetermined criteria. The primary\nclinical objective underlying this project was the increased and\nsafe utilisation of livers which are currently discarded.\nThe trial demonstrates that viability testing with NMP is fea\ufffesible, and the objective assessment enables successful transplan\ufffetation of 71% of perfused discarded livers, with 100% 90-day\npatient and graft survival. The intervention does not seem to\nprevent the development of non-anastomotic biliary strictures in\nlivers donated after circulatory death (DCD) with prolonged\ndonor warm ischaemic times.\nResults\nCharacteristics of discarded liver offers and study participants.\nOver the 16-month study duration from November 2016 to\nFebruary 2018, there were 185 livers discarded for clinical use and\noffered for research. Characteristics of those offers and the study\ninclusion flowchart are provided in Fig. 1a, b.\nOne hundred and sixty-four patients on the waiting list were\napproached for potential participation, of which 53 were\nconsented, and 22 were enroled in the study and received rescued\ngrafts. The potential participants were counselled regarding the\nhigh-risk nature of the project and unknown long-term outcomes\nof resuscitated livers. As a consequence, a proportion of patients\nwere understandably reluctant to participate, and therefore the\nlack of suitable consented recipients was the principal rate limiting\nfactor for inclusion. The number of consented patients at any\ngiven time ranged from 1 to 9; the flow diagram displaying the\nprogress of patients through the trial is shown in Fig. 2.\nDonor liver characteristics and liver biopsy features. In 8 (26%)\ndonors the liver was the only procured organ. All discarded donor\nlivers entered in the study satisfied one or more of the inclusion\nhigh-risk criteria. The livers enroled in the trial consisted of 17\norgans donated after brainstem death (DBD) and 14 DCD. Many\nof these organs looked grossly suboptimal, with some degree of\nsteatosis, capsular fibrosis or rounded edges with multifactorial\nreasons for discard, that was captured by the donor risk index\n(DRI) > 2.0 in 22 (71%) livers, with the median DRI 2.2 (1.9–2.9).\nDetailed characteristics are shown in Table 1 and Supplementary\nTable 1. Photos of all included livers are presented in Fig. 3. The\ntransplanted livers were typically smaller than non-viable ones\n(1.7 vs. 2.0 kg, p = 0.015; Kruskal–Wallis test), with lower peak\npre-mortem donor liver enzyme levels. The median static cold\nstorage time before starting NMP was 7 h:44 min (6:29–10:25).\nOnly 3 (10%) livers were included in the trial primarily for\nmacrosteatosis >30%, (50%, 80% and 60% macrovesicular stea\ufffetosis combined with 11 h:55 min, 12 h:00 min and 6 h:15 min cold\nischaemia, respectively).

The detailed\nhistological finding of each study liver is provided in Supple\ufffementary Table 2.\nPerfusion parameters assessment. During the NMP procedure\n25 livers quickly recovered metabolic activity and cleared lactate\nto the target level (details provided in Fig. 4). A biopsy of a\nsuspicious donor colonic lesion confirmed malignancy, making\none liver unsuitable for transplantation, after meeting the viability\ncriteria. In three livers, criteria were initially met, however,\nmetabolic function thereafter deteriorated within the first 4 h,\nwith increasing lactate. In two cases the transplant procedure was\nnot commenced and the livers were discarded. In the third, the\nexplant had begun, and the procedure continued.

The majority (64%) of recipients were men,\nand median age was 56 (46–65) years. The leading indication for\ntransplantation was alcohol-related liver disease (36%), followed\nby primary sclerosing cholangitis (27%) and non-alcoholic stea\ufffetohepatitis (18%). In three (14%) patients the underlying liver\ndisease was complicated by liver cancer. The median UKELD18\nscore was 52 (49–55), with a calculated laboratory MELD score of\n12 (9–16).

One patient developed an\nintra-operative hepatic artery thrombosis after receiving a DBD\ngraft that had sustained a hepatic arterial injury during procure\ufffement. The artery was reconstructed but post-operatively throm\ufffebosed, undergoing emergency revascularisation which achieved\nlong-lasting arterial patency. The graft, however, developed biliary\nstrictures requiring multiple interventions and eventual re\ufffetransplantation.\nThe per-protocol magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatogra\ufffephy (MRCP) imaging at 6 months revealed that 2 (9%) patients\ndeveloped anastomotic, and 4 (18%) patients non-anastomotic\nbiliary strictures that presented with cholestatic symptoms. With\nthe exception of the patient with hepatic artery thrombosis, all\nbiliary strictures affected recipients of DCD grafts.

Over the\n16-month study period there were 185 discarded liver research offers, of which 59 (32%) were not eligible for the trial due to an incidental finding of\ncancer, macroscopically apparent cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis, severe organ damage or previous machine perfusion. There were 126 livers suitable for the\ntrial, with steatosis being the leading cause of organ discard with 78 (42%) offers. Stringent donor inclusion criteria were not met in 25 (14%) offers and on\n21 (11%) occasions the research team was already committed to the perfusion of another study liver. A liver was considered for the trial only if it could be\nallocated to a consented, potential blood group- and size-matched low-risk recipient. Many recipients were apprehensive to participate in such a high-risk\nclinical trial, and as a consequence, at any given time there were usually only one to three patients consented. A significant proportion of approached\npatients declined to take part, or were transplanted with a standard quality liver before agreeing to take part in this study. Eventually, thirty-one livers were\nenroled to the trial, of which 22 (71%) grafts met the viability criteria and were successfully transplanted. b A summary of reasons for livers being\ndiscarded in the United Kingdom between November 2016 and February 2018. A total of 64 livers were discarded for severe steatosis on visual\nassessment, with 14 discarded for severe steatosis based on urgent liver biopsy. A percentage of livers were declined due to intra-abdominal or lung\nmalignancies (e.g. colonic cancer in donor 22). This did not include primary brain tumours or small renal cell cancers which are almost always considered\nfor donation. The reasons for logistic discard, include the transplant team already being committed to one or more transplantations, lack of a suitable\nrecipient or too long an anticipated cold ischaemia time due to delays with transportation.\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16251-3 ARTICLE\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2020) 11:2939 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16251-3 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 3\n\nregression). There were no differences in the other assessed\nparameters, including the need for post-transplant renal repla\ufffecement therapy, hospital stay or incidence of Clavien–Dindo\ngrade ≥ 3 complication rates. The incidence of clinically manifest\nnon-anastomotic biliary strictures was higher in the study group\n(18% vs. 2%, odds ratio 8.0, 95% CI: 0.9–71.6; p = 0.063; condi\ufffetional logistic regression), although this result needs to be inter\ufffepreted with caution as the matched control patients did not\nreceive systematic bile duct imaging. Due to the small sample\nsizes these comparison results should be interpreted with caution,\nand the controls were included to present the study results within\nthe context of the unit’s contemporary outcomes. The details are\nshown in Table 3.\nDiscussion\nUtilisation of livers from organ donors is currently a major\nchallenge in liver transplantation19. Despite a waiting list mor\ufffetality in Western countries reaching 20–30%, an increasing pro\ufffeportion of extended criteria livers are unused due to concerns of\nprimary non-function and early graft dysfunction20,21. The\ndecision to discard donor livers is still largely based upon donor\nhistory and subjective assessment by the transplanting surgeon.\nStandard cold static preservation does not allow for any assess\ufffement of liver function, and the only other source of information is\nliver histology, which is able to diagnose severe large droplet fatty\nchange, a well-recognised risk factor for non-function21. This\nstudy has demonstrated that moving from subjective evaluation\nto objective testing during NMP might salvage a high proportion\nof those livers that are currently discarded. The need to improve\nthe method by which high-risk livers are assessed was illustrated\nin this study by the absence of significant differences in the donor\ncharacteristics between transplanted and discarded livers.\nThe present trial is the first to systematically investigate\nobjective viability criteria in livers that met specific high-risk\nfeatures in organs initially considered “untransplantable”11,22.\nOne major challenge addressed in the VITTAL trial design was\nthat each discarded liver had to also fulfil one or more pre\ufffedefined objective high-risk criteria, as the considerations for liver\ntransplantability are always multi-factorial, including the reci\ufffepientʼs condition, logistical aspects and the surgeon’s (or trans\ufffeplant centre’s) experience and risk-taking attitude. The utilisation\nof marginal livers in the United Kingdom was facilitated by the\ncentre-based liver allocation system, allowing the use of high-risk\norgans in any patient on the waiting list. All enroled organs were\nsimultaneously fast-track offered to all UK transplant centres\nfollowing the initial decline, and the fact that none of the seven\ncentres were comfortable using any of the livers included in this\ntrial confirms that these organs were uniformly perceived to be of\nvery poor quality. Our team genuinely aimed to push the\nboundaries of utilisation of the highest risk organs by accessing\nParticipant\nenrollment\nAllocation\nFollow up\nAnalysis\nPatients on waiting list approached and\nassessed for eligibility (n = 164)\nExcluded (n = 111)\nMet exclusion criteria; not suitable for\nmarginal graft (n = 48)\nDeclined to take part (n = 22)\nTransplanted with standard livers prior\nto giving study consent (n = 41)\nConsented (n = 53)\nNo randomisation\nTransplanted with standard livers prior to being\noffered a rescued liver (n = 29)\nPatient remained on waiting list (n = 2)\nTransplanted with VITTAL rescued livers (n = 22)\nPassed stage 1 (3 successes/3 patients) and stage 2\n(11 successes/11 patients) interim assessments\nDiscontinued study following liver\nre-transplantation at day 225 (n = 1)\nTransplanted patients analysed for primary\noutcome (90-day survival) and short-term\nsecondary outcomes (n = 22)\nFig. 2 CONSORT flow diagram displaying the progress of patients through the trial. One hundred and sixty-four patients on the waiting list were\napproached for potential trial participation. Of those, 111 were excluded; 48 patients met exclusion criteria and were not suitable for a marginal liver graft.\nTwenty-two patients declined to take part and 41 patients either received a transplant before they provided study consent, or were de-listed, or\nsubsequently met exclusion criteria. Eventually 53 patients consented to the study, of which 29 underwent transplantation with a standard quality liver\nallocated outside the trial. Twenty-two patients were enroled in the trial and received a salvaged liver.\nARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16251-3\n4 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2020) 11:2939 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16251-3 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications\n\nthe benefit of rigorous peer-review and continual oversight within\nthe framework of a clinical trial. We included only organs that\nour team did not feel comfortable to use otherwise, and this\nattitude was reflected by the 2-tier liver inclusion process\nembedded in the trial design, and by the fact that 25 livers, that\nwould very likely meet the transplantability criteria, were not\nconsidered for study inclusion. Some of the study livers might\nhave been transplantable if the cold ischaemia was very short and\na suitable recipient was waiting, but currently the majority of\nthese organs are discarded. With the introduction of the National\nAllocation system, logistical constraints exacerbated by static cold\nstorage are increasingly common and prevent the utilisation of a\nrising proportion of marginal livers. In these circumstances, NMP\nmitigates the reperfusion process, allowing assessment of the\norgan during perfusion without exposing patients to the risk of\nprimary non-function. In addition, livers discarded due to hae\ufffemodynamic instability (during procurement or during the pro\ufffecess of brain stem death itself), high liver transaminases or poor\nin situ flush, benefited from perfusion in a controlled, near\nphysiological environment thereby facilitating their recovery. The\npotential to recondition the liver in the interval between retrieval\nand implantation has hitherto not been possible.\nAn intervention which increases successful utilisation of high\uffferisk livers will transform access to transplantation to meet pre\ufffedicted increasing demand, particularly given trends in donor\ndemographics and declining organ quality4.

In 2017–2018, not only\nwere 174 retrieved livers discarded, but 425 livers from solid\norgan donors were not even considered suitable for retrieval (11%\nof DBD and 52% of DCD); it is reasonable to assume that many\nof these would be suitable for testing with NMP. Salvaging a\nproportion of these retrieved but discarded organs would add a\ngood number of transplantable livers annually in the UK, sig\ufffenificantly reducing waiting list mortality.\nInternational comparisons demonstrate regional variations in\ndonor demographics and there is evidence that in countries with\nhigher initial organ acceptance rates there is also a higher discard\nrate, particularly for older donors23,24. Viability testing provides\nobjective evidence of liver function with clearance of metabolic\nacidosis, vascular flows, glucose parameters and bile production;\nthese give the transplant surgeon the confidence to use these\norgans safely, and minimises the physical and emotional impact\nof non-transplantation for patients.\n1 2 3 4 5\n6 7 8 9 10\n11 12 13 14 15\n16 17 18 19 20\n21 22 23 24 25\n26 27 28 29 30\n31\nFig. 3 The study liver photographs.

Whilst this approach may\nsimplify adoption of the NMP technology without compromising\noutcomes in transplantable livers25, recovery of organs from\ndonors with multiple high-risk features might be further facili\ufffetated by limiting cold ischaemia through commencing the per\ufffefusion immediately after procurement in the donor hospital14.\nInevitably there will always be livers that are not suitable for\ntransplantation, demonstrated by 30% of offers with macroscopic\ncirrhosis, biopsy-proven fibrosis or an incidental finding of donor\ncancer. A similar proportion of the livers, however, did not meet\nany of our high-risk criteria and were therefore considered “too\ngood” for inclusion. It is reasonable to assume that NMP\nassessment would have provided the reassurance needed to justify\ntransplantation in this group as well.\nImprovements in transplant logistics is one of the major\nadvantages of NMP14,25,26, and the study allowed for the machine\nperfusion duration to be between 4 h (time needed for the via\ufffebility assessment) and 24 h (maximum recommended time by the\nperfusion device manufacturer). Once the liver met the viability\ncriteria we aspired to commence the transplantation as soon as\npossible; however, the perfusion was often extended to allow for a\nday-time procedure, or to facilitate transplant logistics in the unit.\nFrom our experience, 4–6 h perfusion seems to be sufficient for\nadequate assessment and replenishment of the organ’s energy\nresources. Due to recirculation of metabolites accumulated in the\norgans during cold ischaemia, the high-risk organs probably do\nnot benefit from prolonged perfusion. The impact of NMP\nduration on livers initially exposed to prolonged cold ischaemia is\nan area of our ongoing research interest.\nTransplant surgeons in many countries are expanding the\ndonor pool with the use of organs donated after circulatory\ndeath27. In the context of liver transplantation, the longevity of\nthese organs might be compromised by development of non\ufffeanastomotic biliary strictures8. The incidence of clinically man\ufffeifest non-anastomotic biliary strictures in the DCD grafts cohort\nwas 30% (3 out of 10 grafts), higher than the study matched\ncontrols group, but similar to other reported high-risk DCD\nseries28. In concordance with the European prospective nor\ufffemothermic preservation trial, our results suggested that MRCP\nfindings are likely to over-estimate the incidence of biliary com\ufffeplications14. The per-protocol investigation at the 6-month time\npoint would identify over 80% of the clinically relevant biliary\nstrictures and asymptomatic irregularities with varying clinical\nsignificance28. The presented findings are accurate, as the images\nwere correlated with clinical reviews and liver function tests\nthrough the median follow up of 542 (range: 390–784) days.\nNevertheless, it is clear that end-ischaemic NMP does not prevent\nthe development of non-anastomotic biliary strictures in high\uffferisk DCD organs, and our outcomes suggest that extending the\ndonor warm times beyond the currently widely accepted limit of\n30 min is not advisable. This finding was not anticipated at the\ntime of trial design or during the conduct of the trial and only\nbecame evident during the long-term follow up of these grafts\nbeyond the primary end point of 90 days.

Sub\ufffeanalysis of bile samples and determination of biliary endothelial\nhealth is the subject of ongoing research. Evolving novel perfu\ufffesion strategies might enable the use of DCD grafts exposed to\nprolonged warm ischaemia14,29,30.\nThe other limitations of our study include the sensitivity of the\ncut-off lactate value, the non-randomised trial design and exclu\ufffesion of high-risk transplant recipients. Regarding the former,\nfollowing previous experience, we set the lactate viability threshold\nto less than 2.5 mmol/L within 2 h of NMP15,16 To maximise\nutilisation, this trial extended the assessment period to 4 h. Two\nlivers in the trial were discarded following a rise of the perfusate\nlactate after meeting the 2-h target. The significance of this is\nuncertain, although it is notable that a third liver with a similar\npattern of lactate clearance was transplanted and experienced a\nsubstantial period of early allograft dysfunction with a post\ufffetransplant peak ALT of 2074 IU and AST of 3031 IU. Concerning\nthe design, the trial was conducted as a non-randomised study, as\ntransplanting discarded livers with an expected high incidence of\nprimary non-function as controls would be ethically unacceptable.\nWe expect further advances to be achieved through the identifi\ufffecation of specific biomarkers that correlate with long-term graft\noutcomes, in the context of large NMP series or registries. Lastly,\nas we did not want to compound risks, the study did not include\nhigher risk recipients deemed not suitable to receive marginal\norgans at the unit’s multi-disciplinary liver transplant listing\nmeeting. The majority of participants who decided to participate\ndid so after a long period waiting on the list, with progressive\ndeterioration that was not necessarily reflected by their waiting list\nposition. The feasibility of using livers rescued by NMP for the\nhigh-risk recipient is currently under investigation.\nIn conclusion, this trial demonstrated that NMP provides a\nway of objectively assessing high-risk organs, and allowed\ntransplantation in a significant proportion of currently unutilised\nlivers without any incidence of primary non-function. The use of\nperfusion technology was associated with increased graft utilisa\ufffetion, considerably extended preservation time and greatly\nimproved transplant logistics. Adoption of functional assessment\nof high-risk livers can increase access to life saving transplanta\ufffetion and reduce waiting list mortality.\nMethods\nStudy design. This study was a prospective, open label, phase 2 adaptive single\ufffearm trial comprising high-risk livers meeting two-tier inclusion criteria. The first\ufffetier was being considered as unsuitable for transplant by all UK transplant centres\nwithin a nationwide fast-track offering scheme. The trial was performed at a single\ufffeinstitution (Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, UK) with experience in NMP\nand utilisation of high-risk grafts5,31. The second-tier eligibility required at least\none of seven specific criteria that confirmed the high-risk status of every enroled\nliver (Table 4). To minimise risks of high post-transplant complications or mor\ufffetality for the study participants, the trial used an adaptive design with two interim\nsafety analyses (Supplementary Fig. 1). The study design and conduct complied\nwith all relevant regulations regarding the use of human study participants. The\ntrial was funded by the Wellcome Trust, and granted approval by the National\nResearch Ethics Service in London-Dulwich (REC reference 16/LO/1056, Protocol\nnumber RG 15–240) and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory\nAgency and the University Hospitals Birmingham Research and Development\nDepartment. The project was endorsed by the Research, Innovation and Novel\nTechnologies Advisory Group committee of the National Health Service Blood and\nTransplant. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (reference number\nNCT02740608), the protocol has been published32, and the full version is provided\nin the Supplementary Information.\nDiscarded liver inclusion criteria and the study logistics. The study considered\nall potential donors with a diagnosis of brainstem death or Maastricht category III\nand IV donors after circulatory death, aged up to 85 years, initially retrieved with\nthe intent for transplantation but subsequently declined by all UK transplant\ncentres based on the retrieving or transplant surgeon’s assessment. If our centre\nwas the last in the fast-track offering sequence, the liver had to be deemed\nuntransplantable by two consultant surgeons independently. The surgeons were\npaired together to create an overall low threshold for using marginal livers,\nensuring any liver that could be used without viability testing was transplanted,\nthereby minimising bias. For the liver to be eligible it also had to meet at least one\ndefined high-risk criterion (see Tables 1 and 4). Consent for research was provided\nby the donor’s next of kin.\nStudy participants. Eligible participants were those listed electively for primary\nliver transplantation and deemed to be low-to-moderate transplant risk candidates,\nsuitable to receive a high-risk graft, as assessed by the unit’s transplant waiting list\nmulti-disciplinary team. Candidates were required to have a patent portal vein, no\nsignificant comorbidities (cardiovascular diseases, including active angina, a history\nof ischaemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular events, symp\ufffetomatic valvular heart disease or cardiac arrhythmias; pulmonary conditions\nincluding pulmonary hypertension or established diagnosis of pulmonary dys\ufffefunction), a UK end-stage liver disease18 (UKELD) score ≤62 and no history of\nmajor upper abdominal surgery. Each participant was fully informed of being\noffered a marginal graft and gave written consent for the trial in advance of the\norgan offer, after having at least 24 h to consider their participation.\nThe study intervention and liver viability assessment. All livers were cold\ufffepreserved with University of Wisconsin solution and commenced NMP using the\nOrganOx Metra™ device after arrival at the transplant centre. The protocol stipu\ufffelated an NMP duration of between 4 and 24 h. Serial perfusate, bile and tissue\nsamples were taken at regular time intervals. For a liver to be considered viable it\nhad to metabolise perfusate lactate to levels ≤2.5 mmol/L within 4 h of commen\ufffecing the perfusion, in addition to meeting at least 2 of the following additional\ncriteria: evidence of bile production, maintenance of perfusate pH ≥ 7.30, meta\ufffebolism of glucose, maintenance of stable arterial and portal flows (≥150 and\n≥500 mL/min, respectively), and homogenous perfusion with soft consistency of\nthe parenchyma16.\nIf a liver was considered viable, the transplant was set up and performed. At the\npoint of recipient hepatectomy, the NMP team disconnected the organ from the\ndevice, flushed it with 3 l of histidine–tryptophan–ketoglutarate solution at 4 °C\nand handed it over for immediate implantation. Post-transplant management\nfollowed the unit’s standard protocol, with immunosuppression comprising\ntacrolimus, azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil and low-dose steroids. Each\npatient underwent an MRCP at 6 months unless the investigation was clinically\nindicated earlier.\nLiver quality was determined retrospectively through histological analysis of\nparenchymal biopsies which were assessed for pre-existing liver disease, steatosis,\nglycogen content and features of preservation–reperfusion injury.\n1.00\nKaplan–Meier 1 year graft survival estimates\n0.75\n0.50\n0.25\n0.00\n0\nNumber at risk\nCase–Control = Control 37\nCase–Control = Case\n3\n34 30 27 23\n22 21 20 20\n6\nTime post-transplant (Months)\n9 12\nGraft survival probability\n22\nControls Case\nFig. 5 Comparison of 1-year graft survival estimate.

Due to the small sample sizes and that this\nstatistical comparison test was not powered,these results should be\ninterpreted with caution.\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16251-3 ARTICLE\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2020) 11:2939 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16251-3 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 9\n\nOutcome measures. The co-primary outcomes consisted of (A) feasibility of NMP\nin discarded organ recovery and (B) achievement of successful transplantation. The\nperfused organ recovery rate was the proportion of perfusions leading to trans\ufffeplantation. Successful transplantation was defined as 90-day patient survival—a\nnationally accepted, monitored and continuously audited outcome measure.\nThe key secondary outcome measures included assessment of the liver graft\nfunction (by incidence of primary non-function and early allograft dysfunction33)\nliver function test results, 90-day graft survival, intensive therapy unit and post\ufffetransplant in-hospital stays, incidence of vascular complications, and anastomotic\nand non-anastomotic biliary strictures as assessed by MRCP at 6 months.\nPerioperative data collection included haemodynamic stability, incidence of post\ufffereperfusion syndrome and blood-product requirements. Post-transplant adverse\nevents and complication severity were graded according to the Clavien–Dindo\nclassification34. The secondary outcomes were compared with contemporary\ncontrols (1:2), matched in order of priority for the donor graft type, UKELD Score,\ndonor age and donor sex only. Four variables included in the original protocol\n(model of end-stage liver disease [MELD], recipient age, BMI and the liver disease\naetiology) were removed as matching criteria due to confounding correlation and\nbeing overly stringent. No recipient suffered from recurrent disease during the\nstudy follow-up period. The matching criteria used identified 39 patients. There\nwas consistency in the recipient selection for high-risk grafts guided by the unit’s\nprotocols and transplant waiting list multi-disciplinary team meetings that assured\nsimilar characteristics regarding the cardiovascular comorbidities and surgical risks\nin the study participants and the matched controls. The pre-planned comparisons\nwith the matched controls group were not powered to demonstrate any differences.\nDue to the small sample sizes, these results should be interpreted with caution; the\ncontrols were included to present the study results within the context of the unit’s\ncontemporary outcomes.\nStatistical analysis. The trial was powered with an emphasis on (A) the feasibility\nof the intervention using NMP and (B) recipient safety. In terms of the intervention\nfeasibility (A), the aim was to achieve an organ recovery rate of at least 50%, with a\nrate of 30% or less being considered unacceptable. Using a two-stage design35, with\nan interim assessment after 24 livers (continuing if ≥8 livers were recovered), a\nsample size of up to 53 livers undergoing NMP might be required, with target alpha\n(one-sided) of 0.05 (actual alpha = 0.047) and target beta of 0.1 (actual\nbeta = 0.098). NMP was considered feasible for organ recovery if at least 22 livers\nwere recovered from 53 perfused. Though the two statistical inferences are asses\ufffesing different hypotheses (safety and feasibility), they are linked as 22 transplants\nare required for the safety testing of the procedure, which is also the minimum\nnumber required out of 53 perfused livers to be considered feasible.\nFor (B), the mean 90-day patient survival rate for patients receiving liver\ntransplants in the United Kingdom was 93%36. For the discarded livers, the\ndesirable and undesirable 90-day overall survival rates were set at 88% and 73%\n(15% lower), respectively. Using an optimal three-stage adaptive design37 with two\ninterim assessments after 3 patients (requires ≥ 2 successes) and 11 patients\n(≥8 successes), a sample size of 22 patients was required, with alpha (type I error)\nand beta (type II error) of 0.2. As this was an early phase (non-definitive) trial to\nassess the safety of this procedure, a relaxed one-sided alpha was used to attain an\nachievable sample size within the trial duration and cost constraint. The approach\nwas considered successful if there were at least 18 successes out of 22 transplants.\nThe descriptive statistics data were presented as number and percentages, and\nmedian and interquartile range. Due to small numbers, the pre-planned analyses\nused Kruskal–Wallis test to assess differences in continuous variables between two\ngroups and Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. Kaplan–Meier survival\nmethod was used to analyse time-to-event data and conditional logistic regression\nfor matched case–control analysis. All secondary and exploratory analyses were\nTable 4 Study inclusion and criteria.\nGraft inclusion criteria 1.

The trial involved 31 discarded livers from 22 patients, all of whom had high-risk factors for poor liver function. The livers were perfused using NMP technology, which involves pumping a special solution through the liver to maintain its structure and function outside the body. After a median total preservation time of 17 hours, 22 of the livers met the criteria for transplantation and were successfully transplanted into the patients. At the time of writing, all 22 patients were still alive at day 90 post-transplantation, and 10 out of 22 livers survived for one year. These results suggest that NMP can significantly increase the success rate of liver transplantation for high-risk livers, although further studies are needed to confirm these findings. The paper also compares the outcomes of the trial with those of a contemporaneous control group, showing similar patient and graft survival rates. The study was funded by the NIHR Birmingham Biomedical Research Centre and supported by various organizations and individuals, including the Wellcome Trust and OrganOx Ltd.
