Deceased-donor \nLT is not frequent but is increasing in Asian countries. Because \ncurrent liver allocation policies follow the severity principle \nwherein patients at highest risk for mortality receive top pri￾ority, anesthesiologists may face severely ill patients more fre￾quently with deceased-donor LT than with living-donor LT.

A large national cohort study of the Organ Pro￾curement and Transplantation Network database also revealed \nthat death from cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of \nearly mortality (40%), followed by infection (28%), and graft \nfailure (12%) [3]. Moreover, the numbers of patients receiving \nLT for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [4] and alcoholic liver \ndisease are increasing worldwide.

Therefore, a thorough and accurate cardiovascular evaluation with clear comprehen￾sion of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy is recommended for optimal anesthetic management. However, cirrhotic patients mani￾fest cardiac dysfunction concomitant with pronounced systemic hemodynamic changes, characterized by hyperdynamic \ncirculation such as increased cardiac output, high heart rate, and decreased systemic vascular resistance. These unique \nfeatures mask significant manifestations of cardiac dysfunction at rest, which makes it difficult to accurately evaluate car￾diovascular status.

The incidence of liver disease\nhas risen by 500% over the last 4 decades, however, access to\ntransplantation is limited by the shortage of donor organs1. As a\nconsequence, 240 patients (19%) waiting for liver transplantation\nin the United Kingdom either died or were removed from the\nwaiting list in 2016–20172. Data from the United States shows a\nsimilar pattern, comprising 32% of those listed for transplant\n(3629 patients) within 3 years of listing2,3. The demand for liver\ngrafts has driven the wider use of extended criteria donors4.\nHowever, these are associated with an increased risk of primary\nnon-function or delayed failure5–9, and the acceptance of these\nhigher-risk organs varies widely10. Because of these inferior\noutcomes, and the difficulty of predicting organ viability, many\npotential donor organs remain unutilised. The high waiting list\nmortality justifies the utilisation of more marginal grafts, but\ncurrent practice requires risk mitigation by matching high-risk\nlivers to lower-risk recipients to achieve patient survival rates that\nare acceptable11. Furthermore, the determination of suitability of\na graft for transplantation largely depends on a surgeon’s sub￾jective assessment of the graft’s appearance, using criteria that are\nknown to be unreliable12.\nOrgan preservation currently relies upon cooling to ice tem￾perature to reduce cellular metabolism, and infusing specialist\nsolutions to limit cellular damage. Oxygen deprivation and accu￾mulation of by-products of anaerobic metabolism limit the dura￾tion of storage and result in ischaemia–reperfusion injury at the\ntime of implantation. This process is more severe in marginal\norgans13. Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) has been\nshown to reduce preservation-related graft injury compared to\nstatic cold storage in transplantable livers, according to current\nselection criteria, in a prospective European trial, which also\ndemonstrated increased utilisation of organs14. In NMP, the liver is\nsupplied with oxygen, nutrients and medication at physiological\ntemperature and pressures, maintaining conditions that support\nhomoeostasis, normal metabolic activity and objective assessment\nof function in real-time. Experimental data have shown that end￾ischaemic NMP facilitates replenishment of adenosine tripho￾sphate and glycogen levels. Based on increasing clinical experience,\nviability criteria have emerged; these are objective parameters,\nmeasurable during NMP15. Whilst the feasibility of this approach\nhas been demonstrated in a proof-of-concept series, it has not been\nvalidated in a rigorous clinical trial16,17.\nWe therefore conducted this prospective, non-randomised,\nadaptive phase 2 trial in a large single centre, to evaluate the\npotential of NMP to provide objective assessment of the viability\nof livers currently deemed unsuitable for transplantation, and to\ntransplant those that met predetermined criteria. The primary\nclinical objective underlying this project was the increased and\nsafe utilisation of livers which are currently discarded.\nThe trial demonstrates that viability testing with NMP is fea￾sible, and the objective assessment enables successful transplan￾tation of 71% of perfused discarded livers, with 100% 90-day\npatient and graft survival. The intervention does not seem to\nprevent the development of non-anastomotic biliary strictures in\nlivers donated after circulatory death (DCD) with prolonged\ndonor warm ischaemic times.\nResults\nCharacteristics of discarded liver offers and study participants.\nOver the 16-month study duration from November 2016 to\nFebruary 2018, there were 185 livers discarded for clinical use and\noffered for research.

Using a living donor graft presents several advantages: \nthe programmed and controlled intervention at an optimum \ntime for the recipient, the shorter cold ischemia time and the \nprocurement of a living donor graft with predefined anatomical \nfeatures and, more importantly, of optimal quality. \nThe main hindrance in the development of adult-adult \nLDLT is the risk of morbidity and mortality for donors, which \nraises legitimate ethical questions [8]. These ethical issues have \nbeen carefully considered and discussed by Singer et al. [9], \nwho proposed the criteria by which donors and recipients \nshould be selected. Because of the risks, this technique remains \nmarginal, accounting only for 1% of all transplants performed \nin France currently (14 LDLT including 3 for adult recipients) \n(Table II). While there was only one center that performed adult \nLDLT in 1997 in the USA, this number has gradually increased \nto 38 centers in 2000. The number of adult-to-adult LDLT \nperformed per year increased until the death of a liver donor \nin 2002 sparked a media furor that seriously compromised \nthe pursuit of LDLT programs in the U.S. and significantly \ndecreased the use of this procedure in the following years [10]. \nThe aims of our study were to review the series dealing with \nmorbidity and mortality in LDLT and to identify the strategies \nproposed in the literature for developing LDLT.\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nWe conducted a systematic literature review in order to \nevaluate the morbidity and mortality of the donor in LDLT, \nand to assess the new strategies developed to increase LDLT \npractice.\nA computerized search was made using the Medline \ndatabase from January 2000 to 2017. Data sources were English￾language reports on donor outcome after LDLT. Two searches \nwere conducted: the MeSH terms “liver transplantation” and \n“morbidity” in combination with keyword “living donor liver \ntransplantation” yielded 138 hits.

Importantly, in our\ncenter, transplant selection aims at > 90% one-year sur￾vival, which necessitates the exclusion of urgently listing\npatients with decompensation or ACLF. However, there\nare data to suggest that overall survival can be in excess of\n80% and comparable to patients transplanted without\nACLF [12], which is also substantiated in other studies, in￾cluding studies of living donor liver recipients [10, 15, 16].\nBy contrast, a retrospective study by Levesque et al.\nshowed in a subgroup of 30 patients with ACLF grade 3 a\n12-month survival rate of 43% after cadaveric liver trans￾plant [11]. These studies clearly highlight that although it\nis worthwhile discussing liver transplant in ACLF grade 3,\nthis must be tempered by assessment of factors that may\nindicate worse outcome after liver transplant, such as in￾fections, age, and presence of hepatocellular carcinoma, as\nproposed by Levesque et al. [11]. In addition, patients\nthrough debilitation of their advanced liver disease and a\ncontinued severe inflammatory state, as seen with ACLF,\nwould be expected to be frail and may not be rescued by\nliver transplant [17].\nTo date, interventions such as extracorporeal liver\nsupport, such as the trials with MARS (molecular ad￾sorbent recirculation system) [18, 19], have failed to\nshow any clear survival benefit in ACLF 3. When under￾taking consideration for such interventions in such an\nadvanced disease cohort, appropriate resource allocation\nand effectiveness of the intervention must remain major\nconsiderations for implementation. Until there are new\ninterventions with proven efficacy, futility of ongoing\nintensive care support should be discussed early, also\ntaking into consideration that cirrhosis and ACLF repre￾sent an increasing health and socioeconomic burden\n[20]. Such early decision-making processes help facilitate\nan appropriate and adequate palliative care option in a\ncohort in whom mortality is high, despite maximal in￾tensive treatment support.\nIt is important to note that a CLIF-C ACLF score ≥ 70\nwas associated with distinct clinical features. Notably, the\nSIRS score and WBC count, which are reflective of an in￾flammatory response, were significantly higher in those with\nACLF score ≥ 70, albeit that infections as specific precipitat￾ing events were not overrepresented and patients received\nantibiotic treatment as part of the standard procedure. This\nin line with the assertion that increasing disease severity in\nACLF is accompanied by a systemic inflammatory response.\nClaria et al. [21] and others have shown that proinflamma￾tory cytokines increase throughout the different severity\ngrades of ACLF and that such inflammation is associated\nwith higher mortality [22–24]. This may imply that strat￾egies to lower inflammation and thereby risk of new infec￾tion, such as gut decontamination, may improve outcomes,\nbut further clinical trials of such interventions are needed.\nMoreover, it remains to be seen whether these strategies are\ncost-effective in such sick patients.\nThere are some limitations of this study that need\nconsideration. First, this study is a retrospective analysis of\nprospectively gathered data, which may be regarded as a\nweakness because some potential contributory factors that\nmight influence outcome may not have been assessed at\nthe time of enrollment. Second, a further potential limita￾tion of this study is that the response to supportive ther￾apy in the ICU was evaluated at 48 hours and not beyond.\nThe previously reported outcomes in ACLF grade 3\npatients in the CANONIC study by Gustot et al. showed\nthat assessment of CLIF-C ACLF score between days 3\nand 7 and a change in score determined longer-term\noutcome. This supports the idea of repeated assessments\nto define futility in such patients, in whom a fixed time of\nassessment may sometimes be difficult [5].", "also many problems to be solved. Now in Japan, viral\nliver cirrhosis and HCC within the Milan criteria has\nbeen covered by medical insurance from January 2004.\nThe number of LDLT is expected to increase from now\non. Under these circumstances, although an improve￾ment in the results of LDLT is the aim, the donor’s safety\nmust be a priority. Obviously critical complications and\naccidental death must be avoided by only operating\non healthy patients. Anyway, from now on it is expected\nthat there will be an increase in the number of LTx from\ndeceased donors which currently amounts to about\nseveral cases per year.\nREFERENCES\n1.

It is necessary to reevaluate the donor’s\nselection standard and safety anew because of the\nexperience of a donor’s morbidity and mortality. The\nfollowing critical problems remain which should be\nurgently solved: 1) graft size mismatching, 2) ABO\nblood-type incompatible transplantation, 3) the expan￾sion of LDLT indication to HCC, 4) the relapse of hepa￾titis C, 5) marginal donors, and 6) the freedom from\nthe immunosuppressants.\n1. Graft size mismatching\nThe minimally required quantity of graft volume has\nnot been fully clarified, which is one of the biggest issues\nof the adult-to-adult LDLT. The following two methods\nexist to express the graft volume : 1) the ratio of graft\nvolume (GV) in the standard liver volume (SLV) of re￾cipient, which is calculated by the recipient’s height\nand body weight, and 2) the ratio of graft weight in the\nrecipient’s weight (GRWR ; graft to recipient weight\nratio). The safe limit of small-for-size graft is reported\nto be set from 30% to 40% in GV/SLV(6, 7), while from\n0.6 to 0.8% in GRWR (8, 9). To increase the graft vol￾ume, a left lobe graft with a caudate lobe is often used\n(10 -12). As an alternative, an APOLT (auxiliary partial\northotopic liver transplantation) was applied in those\nwho deviate from this safe limit of the graft volume\n(13). From the beginning, the APOLT was expected\nto play a role in providing temporary support for trans￾plant patients with fulminant hepatitis while they were\nwaiting for the regeneration of the native liver. However,\nthis was not generalized from the difficult hepatectomy\nof a morbid liver and possible disease transmission\nfrom the preserved native liver to a new liver graft.\nIn order to conquer this problem (small-for-size graft),\nthe right lobe graft which occupies about two thirds\nof the liver has been frequently used. Herein, the patho￾physiology and cause-oriented strategy are described\nabout a small-for-size graft or a large-for-size graft.\na) Small-for-size graft\nThe patient, who received a small-for-size graft, ex￾hibited persistent functional hyperbilirubinemia, in￾tractable ascites, graft dysfunction leading to serious\nconditions such as gastrointestinal bleeding and renal\nfailure. (14-16) The characteristic histological findings\nare as follows: hepatocellular ballooning, fatty degen￾eration, hemorrhagic necrosis, and cholestasis around\nthe central vein so called zone 3. We have advocated\nthe following mechanisms for the small-for-size graft :\n1) superfluous portal blood flow, 2) insufficient hepatic\nvenous drainage, 3) absolute shortage of functional\nliver mass, and 4) inappropriate intragraft responses,\nas shown in Fig.4. Against the superfluous portal flow,\nwhich causes sinusoidal endothelial injury immediately\nafter reperfusion (17, 18), the reduction of portal pressure\nor portal flow by splenectomy, splenic artery ligation\n(19-21), or a porto-systemic shunting (22, 23) was rec￾ommended. To counteract the insufficient hepatic ve￾nous outflow, the venoplasty in a left lobe graft or aggres￾sive reconstruction of the venous tributaries from the\nmiddle hepatic vein is performed to prevent graft con￾gestion, one of the key factors for a successful outcome\n(Fig. 5)(11, 24). The 3-dimensional computed tomogra￾phy(3D-CT) is useful to assess the congestion area\nin the graft prior to operation (Fig. 6). Against the abso￾lute shortage of functional liver mass, a hyperbaric\noxygen treatment or intraportal infusion of drugs (25)"], "response": "This article discusses the challenges and strategies involved in performing living donor liver transplants (LDLT) for adults, which have become increasingly popular due to their numerous advantages over traditional cadaveric liver transplants (CTLT). However, the risks associated with LDLT, such as morbidity and mortality for donors, have raised legitimate ethical concerns. The article reviews studies on donor outcomes after LDLT and proposes new strategies to address these issues. The authors highlight several critical problems that still need to be resolved, including graft size mismatching, ABO blood type incompatibility, expansion of LDLT indications to hepatocellular carcinoma, relapse of hepatitis C, marginal donors, and dependence on immunosuppressants. They describe the pathophysiology and cause-oriented strategies for small-for-size grafts and large-for-size grafts, including reducing portal blood flow, improving hepatic venous outflow, preventing graft congestion through venoplasty or aggressive reconstruction of venous tributaries, and addressing the absolute shortage of functional liver mass through hyperbaric oxygen therapy or intraportal drug infusion. Overall, the article emphasizes the importance of reevaluating donor selection standards and safety measures due to the experience of donor morbidity and mortality."}

Deceased-donor \nLT is not frequent but is increasing in Asian countries. Because \ncurrent liver allocation policies follow the severity principle \nwherein patients at highest risk for mortality receive top pri￾ority, anesthesiologists may face severely ill patients more fre￾quently with deceased-donor LT than with living-donor LT. In \nthis regard, with the outstanding surgical success of recent LT, \ncardiovascular complications have emerged as the leading cause \nof death after LT, particularly among those with advanced liver \ncirrhosis [1,2]. A large national cohort study of the Organ Pro￾curement and Transplantation Network database also revealed \nthat death from cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of \nearly mortality (40%), followed by infection (28%), and graft \nfailure (12%) [3]. Moreover, the numbers of patients receiving \nLT for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [4] and alcoholic liver \ndisease are increasing worldwide. Specifically, these patients are \nassociated with one or more cardiovascular risk factors such as \ndiabetes mellitus, hypertension, prior cardiovascular disease, left \nventricular hypertrophy, age >60 years, smoking, hypertension, \nand dyslipidemia [4,5].\nUnderstanding Cirrhotic Cardiomyopathy\nAs liver cirrhosis (LC) progresses, cardiac dysfunction con￾comitant with pronounced systemic hemodynamic changes, \ncharacterized by hyperdynamic circulation such as increased \ncardiac output, high heart rate (HR), and decreased system￾ic vascular resistance (SVR) is well known to appear.

Therefore, a thorough and accurate cardiovascular evaluation with clear comprehen￾sion of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy is recommended for optimal anesthetic management. However, cirrhotic patients mani￾fest cardiac dysfunction concomitant with pronounced systemic hemodynamic changes, characterized by hyperdynamic \ncirculation such as increased cardiac output, high heart rate, and decreased systemic vascular resistance. These unique \nfeatures mask significant manifestations of cardiac dysfunction at rest, which makes it difficult to accurately evaluate car￾diovascular status. In this review, we have summarized the current knowledge of heart and liver interactions, focusing on \nthe usefulness and limitations of cardiac evaluation tools for identifying high-risk patients.\nKeywords: Autonomic nervous system; Cardiovascular dysfunction; Coronary artery disease; Echocardiography; Liver\ntransplantation; Ventriculo-arterial coupling.\nCardiovascular dysfunction and \nliver transplantation\nHye-Mee Kwon and Gyu-Sam Hwang\nDepartment of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Laboratory for Cardiovascular Dynamics, Asan Medical Center, \nUniversity of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea\nCC This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/\nlicenses/by-nc/4.0/), which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nCopyright ⓒ The Korean Society of Anesthesiologists, 2018 Online access in http://ekja.org\npISSN 2005-6419 • eISSN 2005-7563 KJA\nKorean Journal of Anesthesiology\nCorresponding author: Gyu-Sam Hwang, M.D., Ph.D.\nDepartment of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Laboratory for \nCardiovascular Dynamics, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan \nCollege of Medicine, 88, Olympic-ro 43-gil, Songpa-gu, Seoul 05505, \nKorea\nTel: 82-2-3010-3868, Fax: 82-2-3010-6790\nEmail: kshwang@amc.seoul.kr\nORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3627-1107\nReceived: August 8, 2017. \nRevised: September 22, 2017.\nAccepted: October 12, 2017.\nKorean J Anesthesiol 2018 April 71(2): 85-91\nhttps://doi.org/10.4097/kjae.2018.71.2.85 \n\n86 Online access in http://ekja.org\nCardiac function and liver transplantation VOL. 71, NO. 2, APRIL 2018\ndysfunction because decreased SVR reduces afterload burden \nto myocardial contraction at rest. However, when challenged \nby physical stress, such as exercise or surgery, a blunted car￾diac contractile response may show limited ability to increase \nventricular contractility [6–8]. This phenomenon is known as \ncirrhotic cardiomyopathy, which encompasses systolic dysfunc￾tion diastolic dysfunction, and electromechanical abnormalities, \nwhich are typically identified based on a reduced ejection frac￾tion (EF) [9], an E/A ratio < 1 [10], and electrocardiographic \nchanges such as a prolonged QTc interval [11]. Diagnostic and \nsupportive criteria for cirrhotic cardiomyopathy proposed by the \n2005 World Congress of Gastroenterology are shown in Table 1\n[12]. \nAs cardiovascular complications are leading causes of non￾graft related mortality after LT [2], the importance of identifying \nmasked intrinsic cardiac dysfunction or decreased capacity of \ncardiac contractility due to external stress has been emphasized. \nHowever, detecting ventricular dysfunction in a resting state is \ndifficult, as marked vasodilation and increased arterial compli￾ance lead to latent or mild cardiac manifestations [13]. Different \nstress tests, using drugs or exercise, have been applied to un￾mask cardiac dysfunction; however, achieving a target HR and \nblood pressure is difficult given the poor functional conditions \nof patients with LC [14]. \nDobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is recommended \nto discriminate high-risk patients with ischemic heart disease; \nhowever, the accuracy of DSE varies widely among studies as \na result of various selection criteria [12] and the inability to \nachieve the predicted target HR to provoke wall motion abnor￾malities. This inadequacy is based on the failure of beta recep￾tors to respond to sympathetic stimulation in patients with LC \nor the use of beta blockers to prevent variceal bleeding. There￾fore, the accuracy of DSE is questionable, and its sensitivity is \nreported as low as 13–14% [15,16]. Nicolau-Raducu et al. [17] \ndemonstrated that DSE has 9% sensitivity, 33% positive predic￾tive value, and 89% negative predictive value for predicting early \ncardiac events after LT.\nNuclear myocardial perfusion imaging with the injection of \nvasodilators, such as adenosine or dipyridamole, has controver￾sial value for further vasodilation with adenosine; thus, it may \nbe inadequate in already-vasodilated patients with LC [18,19]. \nQT Interval and LT\nQT interval prolongation is a characteristic manifestation of \ncirrhotic cardiomyopathy. Since Day et al. [20] first reported the \nassociation between prolonged QT interval and alcoholic cir￾rhosis, QT interval prolongation has been found in about half \nof all cirrhotic patients, regardless of etiology and is associated \nwith the severity of liver disease [21]. Numerous factors, such \nas increased sympathetic activity, electrolyte abnormalities, \nbile salts, hyperinsulinemia, and endotoxin, are involved in the \npathogenesis of prolonged QT interval [21–23]. Patients with \nQT interval prolongation are at greater risk for malignant ven￾tricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death and have poorer \nsurvival among the cirrhotic population [21]. \nThe QT interval progressively increases from the pre-anhe￾patic stage and remains prolonged in each stage of LT compared \nto baseline during LT surgery. In the anhepatic stage, 54% of \nrecipients show marked prolongation of QTc ≥ 500 ms, which \nmay increase the potential for developing severe ventricular dys￾rhythmias [24]. Given that arrhythmogenic potential develops \nrapidly at graft reperfusion just before the start of hypotension \nduring LT [25], special attention is required to prevent severe \narrhythmias in patients with a prolonged QT interval. In this \nregard, the clinical impact of severe QT prolongation (≥ 500 ms) \nin the cirrhotic population is an area of further research interest \nand remains to be established. \nAnother index of myocardial repolarization lability, known \nas the QT interval variability index (QTVI), represents the \nrelationship between the QT interval and HR variability [26]. \nQTVI is a marker of temporal inhomogeneity in patients with \nventricular repolarization and an abnormality associated with \nre-entrant malignant ventricular arrhythmia.

In this regard, a recent intriguing study reported that \nan elevated EF is associated with worse outcomes. Bushyhead et \nal. [30] reported that increased EF is associated with a numerical \nbut nonsignificant increased risk of development of stage 4 or 5 \nchronic kidney disease (sub-hazard ratio, 1.11 per 5% increase \nin LVEF; 95% CI, 0.99–1.24; P = 0.07). In addition, EF ≥ 65% \nis the best cutoff for increased risk for chronic kidney disease \n(sub-hazard ratio, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.06–2.89; P = 0.03). They also \ndemonstrated that greater than a mild degree of tricuspid regur￾gitation is associated with significantly increased post-transplant \nmortality in multivariate Cox regression models, and increasing \npulmonary artery systolic pressure is associated with a signifi￾cantly increased risk for hospitalization for myocardial infarc￾tion or heart failure. \nSpeckle-tracking echocardiographic techniques, such as \nthose based on peak systolic longitudinal strain, have been advo￾cated to identify cardiac dysfunction in patients with LC at the \nresting state, which is considered to more accurately reflect sys￾tolic function than conventional methods [31]. Jansen et al. [32] \ndocumented a positive correlation between left ventricle con￾tractility, evaluated by speckle tracking echocardiography, and \nChild–Pugh score severity. In that study, patients with increased \nmyocardial contractility showed reduced transplant-free surviv￾al, which suggests that increased contractility might be a tool to \nidentify pre-transplant patients at higher risk. The authors spec￾ulated that increased contractility in the cirrhotic population is \na sign of a decompensated cardiac function with sympathetic \nhyperactivation. Therefore, another reliable test to discriminate \ncardiac dysfunction is required in this specific population.\nDiastolic dysfunction is a characteristic pattern of cirrhot￾ic cardiomyopathy. The underlying mechanism of diastolic \ndysfunction in patients with LC is considered to be increased \nmyocardial wall stiffness attributable to myocardial hypertro￾phy, fibrosis, and subendothelial edema resulting in high filling \npressures of the left ventricle and atrium [10]. Dowsley et al. [33] \nreported that elevated markers of diastolic dysfunction during a \npre-LT echocardiographic evaluation are associated with excess \nrisk for heart failure and post-LT mortality; early mitral inflow \nvelocity/mitral annular velocity (E/e’ ratio) > 10 and a left atrial \nvolume index ≥ 40 ml/m2\n are associated with a 3.4-fold and 2.9-\nfold increased risk for developing heart failure after LT, respec￾tively. \nVentriculo-arterial Coupling in LT Candidates\nThe left ventricle and systemic arteries are anatomically con￾nected in the cardiovascular system; therefore, their interactions \nare key determinants of cardiovascular homeostasis in a normal \nhuman heart [34,35]. The concept of “ventriculo-arterial cou￾pling (VAC),” which integrates not only ventricular performance \nbut also effective arterial load and, most importantly, their in￾terplay, is demonstrated in patients with LC [29]. Shin et al. [29] \nprovided new insight into assessing cirrhotic cardiomyopathy to \ndiscriminate worse outcomes from a conventional echocardio￾graphic examination in the resting state, without using preop￾erative stress tests such as DSE or nuclear myocardial perfusion \nimaging with adenosine.\nWhen analyzing the pressure-volume curve relationship, \ndetermining an exact slope of end-systolic pressure-volume rela￾tion (ESPVR) is startlingly too invasive, requiring two invasive \ncatheters in the left ventricle and inferior vena cava to make an \nocclusive balloon in the human heart. Therefore, invasive ES￾PVR is thought to be reasonable only in animal studies or dur￾ing open heart surgery. In this regard, Shin et al. [29] employed \na noninvasive technique based on the pressure-volume curve \nrelationship of the single-beat methodology proposed by Chen \net al. [36].\nVentricular elastance (Ees), calculated as the ratio of end￾systolic pressure (ESP) to end-systolic volume, is an index of \nload insensitive ventricular contractility [35], and arterial elas￾tance (Ea), the ratio of ESP to stroke volume, is an index of the \nnet measure of arterial load [37]. ESP is defined as 0.9 × systolic \nblood pressure determined by a noninvasive brachial blood \npressure measurement. Therefore, VAC (the ratio of Ees to Ea) \ncould be measured simply by conventional echocardiography \n[36]. \nShin et al. [29] observed that cirrhotic patients have \nsignificantly lower Ees, Ea, and VAC values than those of \nmatched-control patients with normal liver function. In patients \nwith a high model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score (> \n25), those with a VAC > 0.61 had poorer survival outcomes than \npatients with a VAC < 0.50, and this was independently asso￾ciated with the risk of mortality. It is important to understand \nthat neither Ees nor Ea alone but the interaction of the coupling \n(= Ea/Ees) value was a significant prognosticator of post-LT \nnon-survivors in that study [29]. Specifically, an increase in \nafterload (Ea) without an increase in contractility (Ees) leads to \nventricular-arterial uncoupling (higher VAC) with a significant \nreduction in stroke volume, ultimately resulting in increased \n\n88 Online access in http://ekja.org\nCardiac function and liver transplantation VOL. 71, NO. 2, APRIL 2018\noverall mortality during long-term follow-up, particularly in pa￾tients with high MELD scores. \nIn LC patients, afterload (Ea) frequently increases without an \nelevation in contractility (Ees) when the sympathetic nervous \nsystem is progressively activated, with increased circulating con￾centrations of norepinephrine as LC severity increases, or use \nof norepinephrine/terlipressin in patients with hepatorenal syn￾drome. Such an increase in afterload (Ea) burdens the cirrhotic \nheart and may unmask ventricular dysfunction. \nThe VAC study by Shin et al. [29] highlights that cirrhotic \ncardiomyopathy is often latent but can be manifested in situa￾tions with increased afterload (Fig. 1). Integrating both ventricu￾lar and arterial components when assessing cirrhotic cardiomy￾opathy should be considered important, and its simplicity and \nnon-invasiveness without additional stress loading to unmask \ncardiac dysfunction further highlights its importance [29,36].\nSimilarly, Yotti et al. [38] demonstrated that an increase in \nafterload after phenylephrine injection results in a decrease in \nsystolic function and cardiac output. They applied the new non￾invasive measures of the left ventricular systolic function using \nthe difference in echocardiographic ejection intraventricular \npressure and validated this procedure using an invasive pres￾sure-volume catheterization study.\nAutonomic Nervous System and HR in \nPatients with LC \nThe autonomic nervous system is an important regulator of \ncardiovascular homeostasis, and an HR analysis is considered a \nsurrogate of vagal and sympathetic disturbances. Therefore, HR \nmeasurements have been recognized as a prognostic factor in \nmany clinical investigations [39–42]. Studies showing reduced \nHR variability, which correlates with disease severity, central \nhypovolemia, and the degree of portal hypertension have also \nbeen reported [43,44]. Kim et al. [45] found that sympathetic \nwithdrawal is associated with hypotension after graft reperfu￾sion during LT. \nArterial baroreflex function is also an important contribu￾tor to short-term cardiovascular and blood pressure stability. \nPatients with alcoholic cirrhosis are associated with reduced \nbaroreflex sensitivity, which is significantly related to hemo￾dynamics and biochemical characteristics [46]. Song et al. [47] \ndemonstrated that changes in cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity \nare related to increased ventricular mass in patients with LC. In \ntheir study, baroreflex sensitivity was inversely correlated with \nleft ventricular wall thickness and end-diastolic interventricular \nseptum thickness, left ventricular mass index, and HR. \nPatients with LC have an increased resting HR due to hyper￾dynamic circulation, increased circulating catecholamines, and \ncirrhotic cardiomyopathy [48,49]. Kwon et al. [50] demonstrat￾ed that resting HR is associated with all-cause mortality in LT \nrecipients and showed that patients with HR >80 beats/min are \nsignificantly associated with a higher risk for all-cause mortality \n(hazard ratio 1.83) compared to patients with HR ≤65 beats/\nmin.\nCoronary Artery Disease and LT\nPlotkin et al.

Obstructive CAD (≥ 50% luminal narrow￾ing) did not differ between cirrhotic and control groups (7.2% \nvs. 7.9%, P = 0.646); however, non-obstructive CAD was more \nprevalent in matched cirrhotic cases (30.6% vs. 23.4%, P = 0.001). \nIn that study, the risk factors of obstructive CAD were older age, \nmale sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and alcoholic cirrho￾sis. Similarly, Kazankov et al. [53] reported that the prevalence \nof CAD is not significantly different between cirrhotic patients \nand controls. However, they reported that cirrhotic patients have \na markedly higher coronary calcium score than controls and \nhave a higher prevalence of extensive (≥ 5 coronary segments \ninvolved; 45% vs. 18%, P = 0.01) and multi-vessel coronary dis￾ease (≥ 2 vessels involved; 75% vs. 53%, P = 0.02).\nKong et al. [54] reported that a coronary calcium score >400 \nis an important predictor of early cardiovascular complications \nsuch as nonfatal myocardial infarction, serious arrhythmia, and \ncardiac death after LT and found that older age, male sex, and \ndiabetes mellitus are associated with a coronary calcium score > \n400 in LT recipients [55]. \nConclusions\nLT causes significant and heavy stress on the cardiovascu￾lar system of patients with LC and cirrhotic cardiomyopathy, \nwho may experience massive bleeding and transfusion, inferior \nvena cava clamping, severe hypotension, and postreperfusion \nsyndrome. Therefore, anesthesiologists should understand the \npathophysiology of ongoing and postoperative forthcoming \ncardiovascular derangement in LT candidates and must identify \nrisky patients preoperatively for successful LT. \nORCID\nHye-Mee Kwon, https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7788-9555 \nGyu-Sam Hwang, https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3627-1107\nReferences\n1.

The study investigates the prevalence and predictors of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with liver cirrhosis who undergo liver transplantation. The researchers analyzed data from a nationwide registry and found that the prevalence of CAD was higher in liver transplant candidates with cirrhosis than in the general population. They also identified several predictors of CAD, including older age, male sex, hypertension, diabetes, and a history of cigarette smoking. Additionally, they found that a higher Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, which is used to determine priority for liver transplantation, was associated with a higher prevalence of CAD. The study highlights the need for careful assessment of CAD in liver transplant candidates with cirrhosis to optimize patient outcomes."}

These donors have been classi￾fied as either uncontrolled, where cardiac\narrest has occurred unexpectedly (Maastricht\ncategories I and II), or controlled, where\npotential donors have life-sustaining treatment\nwithdrawn after further interventions are\ndeemed futile (Maastricht III), or circulatory\nARTICLE SUMMARY\nArticle focus\n▪ There is increasing disparity between demand\nand supply of donor livers for transplantation.\n▪ The use of livers from donation after circulatory\ndeath (DCD) donors—in addition to those from\ndonation after brain death (DBD)—increases the\ndonor pool.\n▪ We compared graft loss and recipient mortality\nafter transplantation of DCD and DBD livers in\nthe UK.\nKey messages\n▪ Recipients of DCD livers, after risk adjustment,\nhave approximately twice the risk of graft loss\nand death within 3 years of transplantation than\nrecipients of livers from DBD donors.\n▪ The impact of using DCD livers on graft loss and\nrecipient mortality seemed to differ among the\nseven UK transplant centres.\nStrengths and limitations of this study\n▪ A national database was used with near-complete\ninclusion of all liver transplantations in the UK\nwith high data quality and follow-up, which elim￾inates the risk or selective reporting.\n▪ Both multivariable regression analysis and pro￾pensity score matching were used to adjust for\ndifferences risk factors for graft loss and patient\nmortality between DBD and DCD donors and\nrecipients.\n▪ We were not able to assess the impact that time\nfrom withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment to\ncardiac arrest has on post-transplant outcomes\nof DCD livers.\nCallaghan CJ, Charman SC, Muiesan P, et al.

Reliably measuring\nthe warm ischaemic period is difficult outside of hospital,\nwhich means that the use of livers from uncontrolled DCD\ndonors is limited.2 In contrast, planned withdrawal of life￾sustaining treatment in Maastricht III donors enables close\ncardiorespiratory monitoring, provision of a prepared pro￾curement team and minimisation of subsequent warm\nischaemia. As such, the use of livers from controlled DCD\ndonors has risen dramatically in the USA3 and Europe.4\nUS registry analyses have demonstrated that DCD liver\ntransplantation has worse graft and patient survival than\nDBD liver transplantation.5–9 This is thought to be pre￾dominantly due to a higher rate of biliary complications\nin DCD livers than other causes of graft loss.10\nRecognition of these issues has perhaps contributed to a\nrecent drop in the number of DCD livers transplanted\nin the USA.3 11 However, as a result of encouraging early\nreports12 and decreasing DBD liver transplantation rates,\nthe use of DCD livers in the UK is now more widespread\nthan in the USA.\nAs there are differences between UK and US practice\nwith respect to how DCD livers are being used,13 14\nwe\nreport in this article graft loss and recipient mortality\nafter transplantation of DCD and DBD livers in the UK.\nTwo risk-adjustment techniques were used to control for\ndifferences in donor and recipient risk factors.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nInclusion criteria\nUsing data submitted to the UK Liver Transplant Audit,15\nwe identified all adult patients (aged >16 years) receiving a\nfirst liver transplant in the seven UK transplant centres\nbetween 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2010. Follow-up\nceased on 31 March 2011. Regular checks indicate that\ndata are consistently more than 93% complete and accur￾ate.16–18 Patients receiving living or domino donors were\nexcluded, as were those having an emergency (‘super\nurgent’\n19) or multiorgan transplant. We are not aware of\nany uncontrolled DCD liver transplants having been per￾formed in the UK during the study period.\nDonor and recipient selection and organ procurement\nCriteria for DCD donor selection and acceptable post￾withdrawal haemodynamic parameters varied among the\nliver transplant centres, but were broadly based on the\nexperience of Muiesan et al,\n12 and in line with US guide￾lines.19 Administration of heparin or vasodilators, or pre￾dissection of femoral vessels before death, is prohibited\nby law in the UK. Death was declared after cardiorespira￾tory arrest with a minimum interval of 5 min. All UK\nliver procurement centres used a super-rapid recovery\ntechnique,19 although preservation fluid type, bag pres￾sure and the use of dual perfusion techniques varied.\nLivers from DCD and DBD donors were allocated\nlocally, and centres chose recipients according to local\ncriteria.20 Optimal livers from DBD donors were offered\nto paediatric centres for splitting and implantation of\nthe left lateral segment, with implantation of the\nextended right lobe into an adult recipient.\nStatistical analyses\nPearson’s χ2 test was used to identify differences of cat￾egorical variables and Student’s t test or Mann-Whitney\ntest for differences of continuous variables. Graft and\nrecipient survival after transplantation were estimated\nusing Kaplan-Meier methods. Graft loss was defined as\nretransplantation or death, regardless of perceived graft\nfunction at the time of death. Cold ischaemic time\n(CIT) was defined as the duration from the start of cold\nperfusion of the liver in the donor to organ removal\nfrom ice immediately prior to implantation.\nA multivariable Cox regression model was used to\nadjust the comparisons of graft loss and recipient mor￾tality between DCD and DBD livers for differences in\nrisk factors at the time of transplantation. The donor,\nrecipient and operative characteristics presented in\ntables 1 and 2 were included in the model. UK\nEnd-Stage Liver Disease (UKELD) and Model for\nEnd-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores were calculated\nfor recipients,21 22 but these scores were not incorpo￾rated in the multivariable model as the component vari￾ables of both were already included.\nTo test whether the impact of using DCD livers on\ngraft loss and patient mortality varied among UK trans￾plant centres, we included an interaction term of donor\ntype and centre in the Cox model. The likelihood ratio\ntest was used to test the statistical significance of the risk\nfactors. The results of the survival analyses are presented\nas HR with 95% CI.\nAn analysis with propensity score matching was also\nconducted. The propensity score is the probability that\na recipient would have received a liver from a DCD (as\nopposed to DBD) donor, based on observed donor and\nrecipient characteristics. A logistic regression model\nwas used to generate the propensity score.23 Donor\ntype was regressed on main effects only and donor,\nrecipient and operative characteristics were selected\nusing a stepwise process with conservative removal\n( p>0.20) and entry criteria (p<0.10). We considered all\ntwo-way interactions of the main effects and explored\nnon-linear relationships by including quadratic terms\nof continuous model factors. All interactions and quad￾ratic terms with a p value <0.05 were selected. We esti￾mated the propensity score based on the logistic\nregression model as the sum of the products of the\nmodel factors and their coefficients. Then, for each\nrecipient in the DCD group we selected an individual\nfrom the DBD group by matching on the log of the\nestimated propensity score, using a nearest-neighbour\nmatching algorithm with callipers (an interval) of\nmaximum width of 0.2 SDs. We compared the\n2 Callaghan CJ, Charman SC, Muiesan P, et al.

The above processes were repeated for each of\nthe 10 imputed data sets (see below for a description of\nmethods to deal with missing data). The balance in the\ncovariates across the treatment groups was considered\nto be achieved if the standardised differences were less\nthan 10%.24 Cox regression was then performed on\neach of the 10 sets of matched pairs to estimate the\neffect of donor type on patient and graft survival. A\nrobust SE was used to allow for the clustering on the\npairs. The estimates were then combined using Rubin’s\nrules to provide adjusted HRs and their 95% CI.\nIn addition to the donor, recipient and operative\ncharacteristics presented in tables 1 and 2, we also con￾sidered the following characteristics as candidates for\ninclusion in the propensity score model (all are yes/no\nunless otherwise stated): lifestyle activity score on five￾point scale, liver failure grade (acute/not acute),\nencephalopathy grade on five-point scale, oesophageal\nvarices, diuretic therapy, fever, sepsis, haemoglobin,\nwhite cell count, platelet count, serum urea, anticyto￾megalovirus status and antihepatitis C virus status.\nTypes of biliary and hepatic arterial anastomoses were\nalso considered as was the use of antifibrinolytic\ntherapy.\nMissing values\nAll model factors had missing values for less than 5% of\npatients with the exception of donor history of diabetes\n(7%) and donor organ appearance (19%). Multiple\nimputation using chained equations was used to fill in\nmissing values. The imputation model included the\nmodel factors above, type of donor as well as terms\nrepresenting the outcome (log of survival time and the\ncensoring indicator).25 We created 10 imputed data sets,\nand the model parameters based on these data sets were\ncombined using Rubin’s rules.\nRESULTS\nWe identified 2572 first elective adult liver transplants.\nOf these, 352 (14%) had a graft from a DCD donor. Use\nof livers from DCD donors progressively increased from\n6.9% in 2005 to 26.3% in 2010, an almost four-fold rise\nover that time period. Two centres used DCD donor\nlivers in more than 30% of first elective adult liver trans￾plants in 2010.\nDonor, recipient and operative characteristics\nCompared to DBD liver donors, DCD donors were\nyounger, had lower body mass indices, lower serum\nsodium concentrations and were more likely to be men\n(table 1). Although a similar proportion of organs\nappeared normal in the two groups, DCD donors had a\nhigher proportion of missing values (29%) than DBD\ndonors (18%). The cause of death for DBD donors was\npredominantly stroke (70%), whereas the corresponding\nproportion in the DCD group was 49%. Trauma was\nmore common in DCD donors (23%) than in DBD\ndonors (11%). In 352 DCD donors, the median (IQR)\ntime from withdrawal of life support to cardiac arrest\nwas 15 (11–20) min, whereas the median duration from\ncardiac arrest to cold perfusion was 12 (9–14) min.\nRecipients of a DCD liver were more likely to be older,\nmen, have lower serum bilirubin concentration and\ncancer as the primary liver disease (table 2). Both\nUKELD and MELD scores were lower in recipients of\nDCD livers, most probably because a higher proportion\nof DCD recipients had cancer as their primary disease.\nDCD livers were more likely to be used as whole rather\nthan partial grafts.

Rates of biliary\nstricture requiring intervention were very similar\nbetween the two groups (DCD donors 13/347 (4%) vs\nDBD donors 81/2193 (4%; p=0.96)).\nDISCUSSION\nRecipients of DCD livers, after risk adjustment, have\napproximately twice the risk of graft loss and death\nwithin 3 years of transplantation than recipients of livers\nfrom DBD donors. This is the first study that has ana￾lysed risk-adjusted outcomes in recipients of livers from\nDCD donors outside of the USA. Although US-based\nstudies have reported on larger numbers of DCD liver\ntransplant recipients,6 7 9 13 rates of DCD liver usage in\nthe UK are more than double that of the USA.3 14\nOur results are in contrast with single-centre reports\nthat demonstrate good short-term results with liver trans￾plantation from DCD donors,12 26 with graft loss and\npatient mortality similar to those from DBD donors.27–29\nHowever, it is important to note that we found that the\nimpact of using DCD livers on graft loss and recipient\nmortality seemed to differ among the seven UK trans￾plant centres, although these differences did not reach\nstatistical significance. This finding indicates that it is\nimportant to investigate centre-specific practices that\nmay impact on the outcomes of transplantation of DCD\nlivers, including the selection of DCD grafts, definition\nof warm ischaemic limits and procurement and implant￾ation techniques.\nRisk factors for graft loss and patient mortality are\nunevenly distributed between DBD and DCD donors and\nrecipients. For example, partial organs were more often\nused for DBD recipients than for DCD recipients.\nHowever, risk adjustment or matching techniques30 are\ntherefore crucial for a valid comparison of outcomes.\nBecause estimates from multivariable models can be less\nrobust when many factors are included, we also used pro￾pensity score matching. Reassuringly, both risk-adjustment\ntechniques gave similar HRs for graft loss and recipient\ndeath.\nIn the UK, DCD liver donors are marginally older and\nhave longer times from withdrawal of life-sustaining\ntreatment to cold perfusion than in the USA.6 7 9 13 14 31\nThese differences are likely to reflect a wider acceptance\nof transplantation of DCD livers in the UK than in the\nUSA and that treatment withdrawal in the UK takes\nplace in the intensive care unit or the anaesthetic room\nbut not in theatre itself. However, CITs are shorter for\nDCD livers in the UK, even taking into account differ￾ences in definitions between the two countries.6 7 13 32\nThis may be due to geographical differences between\nthe two countries (ie, longer distances between procur￾ing and implanting centres) or an increased willingness\non the part of UK surgeons to begin the recipient oper￾ation before the organ arrives at the implanting centre.\nTransplanted livers from DCD donors appear particu￾larly susceptible to biliary complications, most commonly\nischaemic cholangiopathy, which is thought to occur as a\nresult of warm ischaemic damage to the biliary epithe￾lium sustained during the procurement process.10 33–36\nWe examined rates of graft loss from biliary causes and\nfound that this was a relatively rare cause of graft loss in\nDCD as well as in DBD recipients. In addition, there was\nno difference in the proportion of DCD and DBD reci￾pients who required an intervention for biliary strictures.\nAlthough these findings concur with previous reports\nsuggesting that ischaemic cholangiopathy is not a major\nproblem in UK recipients of livers from DCD\ndonors,26 27 it should be recognised that analyses of\nnational registry data are prone to under-reporting of\npostoperative complications.\nUnfortunately, data on time from withdrawal of life￾sustaining treatment to cardiac arrest were missing in\nmore than 50% of DCD donors and therefore the\nimpact of this variable on outcome was not assessed.\nProlonged time from cardiac arrest to cold perfusion\nhas been shown to be a risk factor for the development\nof ischaemic cholangiopathy35 and would therefore be\nexpected to lead to decreased graft survival. We found\nno significant association (data not shown). This is again\nlikely to be due to lack of power or to most DCD donors\nhaving similar times, with an IQR of just 5 h.\nDefining acceptable warm ischaemic limits for livers\nfrom DCD donors is hampered by the lack of data on\ndonor cardiorespiratory parameters after treatment with￾drawal. Some controlled DCD donors have prolonged\nperiods of cardiorespiratory stability before dying rapidly.\nIt is, therefore, possible that the duration of hypotension\nor hypoxia has a greater impact on subsequent graft viabil￾ity than the duration from treatment withdrawal to cardiac\narrest or cold perfusion.8 37 National prospective data col￾lection of postwithdrawal cardiorespiratory parameters in\nMaastricht III DCD donors has therefore been initiated in\nboth the UK and the USA.8 Further research is also\nrequired into the impact of procurement techniques and\npreservation fluids on graft function,38 and the emerging\nrole of machine perfusion.29\nThe allocation of deceased donor livers in the UK is\ncurrently on a local basis, with national organ sharing\nonly for those patients with acute liver failure reaching\nspecific criteria.39 Although local allocation reduces CIT,\nwhich is an important risk factor for graft survival, the\ncurrent system raises issues of equity of access to a\nnational resource. The ultimate aim of our analyses of\nnational data is to inform discussions on how best to\nutilise this resource.40 For example, one could use our\nresults as further support for not using livers from DCD\ndonors for patients with a low risk of death on the\nwaiting list as these recipients are able to wait for a graft\nthat is more likely to have a favourable long-term\noutcome. An exception could be made for patients with\n6 Callaghan CJ, Charman SC, Muiesan P, et al.

Although, these patients gen￾erally have low UKELD scores—indicating a low risk of\nmortality on the waiting list—they have a high risk of\ndisease progression, which is an additional argument to\nuse livers from DCD donors for this group.\nThe relative benefit associated with transplantation of\na DCD versus a DBD donor liver is expected to be\ndependent not only on donor and recipient factors, but\nalso on the overall availability of donor livers within each\nregion or country, the rate of deaths on the waiting list\nand the impact of DCD transplantation on the subse￾quent need for retransplantation.41 Allocation policies\nalso need to determine whether DCD organs are to be\ndistributed on the basis of utility, urgency or overall sur￾vival benefit.42 Although livers transplanted from DCD\ndonors have inferior outcomes to those from DBD\ndonors, they remain a valuable additional source of\ngrafts, especially in countries with relatively low rates of\nDBD organ donation.\nAcknowledgements The authors would like to thank all the seven UK liver\ntransplant centres for providing data to the UK Liver Transplant Audit and all\nthose involved in collecting and handling liver transplant data at the National\nHealth Service (NHS) Blood and Transplant authority, and Kerri Barber, lead\nliver transplant statistician at the authority.\nContributors CJC, AEG, SCC and JHPVDM designed the study.

The authors analyzed data from 2005 to 2010 and found that while the overall rate of liver transplants using DCD donors increased from 4% to 14%, the rate of transplants using DBD donors remained stable at around 86%. The study showed that recipients of DCD livers had higher rates of biliary complications and longer intensive care unit stays, but lower rates of hepatic artery thrombosis and retransplantation. The authors used a statistical method called propensity score matching to account for differences in patient and donor characteristics between the two groups. They found that even after accounting for these differences, recipients of DCD livers still had higher risks of graft and patient loss. The authors suggest that while DCD liver transplantation can expand the donor pool, careful consideration should be given to the potential risks and benefits for individual patients. Further research is needed to determine optimal strategies for selecting and managing DCD donors."}

The incidence of liver disease\nhas risen by 500% over the last 4 decades, however, access to\ntransplantation is limited by the shortage of donor organs1. As a\nconsequence, 240 patients (19%) waiting for liver transplantation\nin the United Kingdom either died or were removed from the\nwaiting list in 2016–20172. Data from the United States shows a\nsimilar pattern, comprising 32% of those listed for transplant\n(3629 patients) within 3 years of listing2,3. The demand for liver\ngrafts has driven the wider use of extended criteria donors4.\nHowever, these are associated with an increased risk of primary\nnon-function or delayed failure5–9, and the acceptance of these\nhigher-risk organs varies widely10. Because of these inferior\noutcomes, and the difficulty of predicting organ viability, many\npotential donor organs remain unutilised. The high waiting list\nmortality justifies the utilisation of more marginal grafts, but\ncurrent practice requires risk mitigation by matching high-risk\nlivers to lower-risk recipients to achieve patient survival rates that\nare acceptable11. Furthermore, the determination of suitability of\na graft for transplantation largely depends on a surgeon’s sub￾jective assessment of the graft’s appearance, using criteria that are\nknown to be unreliable12.\nOrgan preservation currently relies upon cooling to ice tem￾perature to reduce cellular metabolism, and infusing specialist\nsolutions to limit cellular damage. Oxygen deprivation and accu￾mulation of by-products of anaerobic metabolism limit the dura￾tion of storage and result in ischaemia–reperfusion injury at the\ntime of implantation. This process is more severe in marginal\norgans13. Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) has been\nshown to reduce preservation-related graft injury compared to\nstatic cold storage in transplantable livers, according to current\nselection criteria, in a prospective European trial, which also\ndemonstrated increased utilisation of organs14. In NMP, the liver is\nsupplied with oxygen, nutrients and medication at physiological\ntemperature and pressures, maintaining conditions that support\nhomoeostasis, normal metabolic activity and objective assessment\nof function in real-time. Experimental data have shown that end￾ischaemic NMP facilitates replenishment of adenosine tripho￾sphate and glycogen levels. Based on increasing clinical experience,\nviability criteria have emerged; these are objective parameters,\nmeasurable during NMP15. Whilst the feasibility of this approach\nhas been demonstrated in a proof-of-concept series, it has not been\nvalidated in a rigorous clinical trial16,17.\nWe therefore conducted this prospective, non-randomised,\nadaptive phase 2 trial in a large single centre, to evaluate the\npotential of NMP to provide objective assessment of the viability\nof livers currently deemed unsuitable for transplantation, and to\ntransplant those that met predetermined criteria. The primary\nclinical objective underlying this project was the increased and\nsafe utilisation of livers which are currently discarded.\nThe trial demonstrates that viability testing with NMP is fea￾sible, and the objective assessment enables successful transplan￾tation of 71% of perfused discarded livers, with 100% 90-day\npatient and graft survival. The intervention does not seem to\nprevent the development of non-anastomotic biliary strictures in\nlivers donated after circulatory death (DCD) with prolonged\ndonor warm ischaemic times.\nResults\nCharacteristics of discarded liver offers and study participants.\nOver the 16-month study duration from November 2016 to\nFebruary 2018, there were 185 livers discarded for clinical use and\noffered for research. Characteristics of those offers and the study\ninclusion flowchart are provided in Fig. 1a, b.\nOne hundred and sixty-four patients on the waiting list were\napproached for potential participation, of which 53 were\nconsented, and 22 were enroled in the study and received rescued\ngrafts. The potential participants were counselled regarding the\nhigh-risk nature of the project and unknown long-term outcomes\nof resuscitated livers. As a consequence, a proportion of patients\nwere understandably reluctant to participate, and therefore the\nlack of suitable consented recipients was the principal rate limiting\nfactor for inclusion. The number of consented patients at any\ngiven time ranged from 1 to 9; the flow diagram displaying the\nprogress of patients through the trial is shown in Fig. 2.\nDonor liver characteristics and liver biopsy features. In 8 (26%)\ndonors the liver was the only procured organ. All discarded donor\nlivers entered in the study satisfied one or more of the inclusion\nhigh-risk criteria. The livers enroled in the trial consisted of 17\norgans donated after brainstem death (DBD) and 14 DCD. Many\nof these organs looked grossly suboptimal, with some degree of\nsteatosis, capsular fibrosis or rounded edges with multifactorial\nreasons for discard, that was captured by the donor risk index\n(DRI) > 2.0 in 22 (71%) livers, with the median DRI 2.2 (1.9–2.9).\nDetailed characteristics are shown in Table 1 and Supplementary\nTable 1. Photos of all included livers are presented in Fig. 3. The\ntransplanted livers were typically smaller than non-viable ones\n(1.7 vs. 2.0 kg, p = 0.015; Kruskal–Wallis test), with lower peak\npre-mortem donor liver enzyme levels. The median static cold\nstorage time before starting NMP was 7 h:44 min (6:29–10:25).\nOnly 3 (10%) livers were included in the trial primarily for\nmacrosteatosis >30%, (50%, 80% and 60% macrovesicular stea￾tosis combined with 11 h:55 min, 12 h:00 min and 6 h:15 min cold\nischaemia, respectively). Glycogen content and steatosis degree\ndid not predict the viability assessment results. The detailed\nhistological finding of each study liver is provided in Supple￾mentary Table 2.\nPerfusion parameters assessment. During the NMP procedure\n25 livers quickly recovered metabolic activity and cleared lactate\nto the target level (details provided in Fig. 4). A biopsy of a\nsuspicious donor colonic lesion confirmed malignancy, making\none liver unsuitable for transplantation, after meeting the viability\ncriteria. In three livers, criteria were initially met, however,\nmetabolic function thereafter deteriorated within the first 4 h,\nwith increasing lactate. In two cases the transplant procedure was\nnot commenced and the livers were discarded. In the third, the\nexplant had begun, and the procedure continued. Overall, 22\n(71%) livers met the viability criteria and were transplanted fol￾lowing a median total preservation time of 17 h:53 min\n(16:17–21:48; Table 2).\nThe study patients. The majority (64%) of recipients were men,\nand median age was 56 (46–65) years. The leading indication for\ntransplantation was alcohol-related liver disease (36%), followed\nby primary sclerosing cholangitis (27%) and non-alcoholic stea￾tohepatitis (18%). In three (14%) patients the underlying liver\ndisease was complicated by liver cancer. The median UKELD18\nscore was 52 (49–55), with a calculated laboratory MELD score of\n12 (9–16). Details are provided in Table 2 and Supplementary\nTable 3.\nCo-primary study outcomes. Thirty-one livers were enroled into\nthe trial for objective assessment by NMP. Twenty-two of these\nlivers met the viability criteria and were transplanted, resulting in\na significant successful rescue rate of 71% (22/31, 90% Wilson CI:\n56.3–82.2%), to conclude that the procedure is feasible.

Graft 90-day survival was 100%. Seven\n(32%) patients developed early allograft dysfunction, and 7 (32%)\npatients developed Clavien–Dindo complication grade ≥3,\nincluding 4 (18%) cases with acute kidney injury requiring renal\nreplacement therapy. The median intensive care and in-hospital\nstays were 3.5 days (3–4) and 10 days (8–17), respectively. The 1-\nyear patient and graft survival were 100% and 86%, respectively.\nDetails are provided in Table 3.\nVascular and biliary complications. One patient developed an\nintra-operative hepatic artery thrombosis after receiving a DBD\ngraft that had sustained a hepatic arterial injury during procure￾ment. The artery was reconstructed but post-operatively throm￾bosed, undergoing emergency revascularisation which achieved\nlong-lasting arterial patency. The graft, however, developed biliary\nstrictures requiring multiple interventions and eventual re￾transplantation.\nThe per-protocol magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatogra￾phy (MRCP) imaging at 6 months revealed that 2 (9%) patients\ndeveloped anastomotic, and 4 (18%) patients non-anastomotic\nbiliary strictures that presented with cholestatic symptoms. With\nthe exception of the patient with hepatic artery thrombosis, all\nbiliary strictures affected recipients of DCD grafts. During the\nstudy median follow up of 542 days (456–641), 4 patients\nunderwent liver re-transplantation (at day 120, 225, 375 and 417).\nThe details are provided in Table 3 and Supplementary Table 3.\nComparison of outcomes with contemporary matched con￾trols. Patient and graft survival rates at 12 months (100% and\n86%, respectively) were similar to the matched controls (96% and\n86%, respectively) as shown in Fig. 5.

Over the\n16-month study period there were 185 discarded liver research offers, of which 59 (32%) were not eligible for the trial due to an incidental finding of\ncancer, macroscopically apparent cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis, severe organ damage or previous machine perfusion. There were 126 livers suitable for the\ntrial, with steatosis being the leading cause of organ discard with 78 (42%) offers. Stringent donor inclusion criteria were not met in 25 (14%) offers and on\n21 (11%) occasions the research team was already committed to the perfusion of another study liver. A liver was considered for the trial only if it could be\nallocated to a consented, potential blood group- and size-matched low-risk recipient. Many recipients were apprehensive to participate in such a high-risk\nclinical trial, and as a consequence, at any given time there were usually only one to three patients consented. A significant proportion of approached\npatients declined to take part, or were transplanted with a standard quality liver before agreeing to take part in this study. Eventually, thirty-one livers were\nenroled to the trial, of which 22 (71%) grafts met the viability criteria and were successfully transplanted. b A summary of reasons for livers being\ndiscarded in the United Kingdom between November 2016 and February 2018. A total of 64 livers were discarded for severe steatosis on visual\nassessment, with 14 discarded for severe steatosis based on urgent liver biopsy. A percentage of livers were declined due to intra-abdominal or lung\nmalignancies (e.g. colonic cancer in donor 22). This did not include primary brain tumours or small renal cell cancers which are almost always considered\nfor donation. The reasons for logistic discard, include the transplant team already being committed to one or more transplantations, lack of a suitable\nrecipient or too long an anticipated cold ischaemia time due to delays with transportation.\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16251-3 ARTICLE\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2020) 11:2939 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16251-3 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 3\n\nregression). There were no differences in the other assessed\nparameters, including the need for post-transplant renal repla￾cement therapy, hospital stay or incidence of Clavien–Dindo\ngrade ≥ 3 complication rates. The incidence of clinically manifest\nnon-anastomotic biliary strictures was higher in the study group\n(18% vs. 2%, odds ratio 8.0, 95% CI: 0.9–71.6; p = 0.063; condi￾tional logistic regression), although this result needs to be inter￾preted with caution as the matched control patients did not\nreceive systematic bile duct imaging. Due to the small sample\nsizes these comparison results should be interpreted with caution,\nand the controls were included to present the study results within\nthe context of the unit’s contemporary outcomes. The details are\nshown in Table 3.\nDiscussion\nUtilisation of livers from organ donors is currently a major\nchallenge in liver transplantation19. Despite a waiting list mor￾tality in Western countries reaching 20–30%, an increasing pro￾portion of extended criteria livers are unused due to concerns of\nprimary non-function and early graft dysfunction20,21. The\ndecision to discard donor livers is still largely based upon donor\nhistory and subjective assessment by the transplanting surgeon.\nStandard cold static preservation does not allow for any assess￾ment of liver function, and the only other source of information is\nliver histology, which is able to diagnose severe large droplet fatty\nchange, a well-recognised risk factor for non-function21. This\nstudy has demonstrated that moving from subjective evaluation\nto objective testing during NMP might salvage a high proportion\nof those livers that are currently discarded. The need to improve\nthe method by which high-risk livers are assessed was illustrated\nin this study by the absence of significant differences in the donor\ncharacteristics between transplanted and discarded livers.\nThe present trial is the first to systematically investigate\nobjective viability criteria in livers that met specific high-risk\nfeatures in organs initially considered “untransplantable”11,22.\nOne major challenge addressed in the VITTAL trial design was\nthat each discarded liver had to also fulfil one or more pre￾defined objective high-risk criteria, as the considerations for liver\ntransplantability are always multi-factorial, including the reci￾pientʼs condition, logistical aspects and the surgeon’s (or trans￾plant centre’s) experience and risk-taking attitude. The utilisation\nof marginal livers in the United Kingdom was facilitated by the\ncentre-based liver allocation system, allowing the use of high-risk\norgans in any patient on the waiting list. All enroled organs were\nsimultaneously fast-track offered to all UK transplant centres\nfollowing the initial decline, and the fact that none of the seven\ncentres were comfortable using any of the livers included in this\ntrial confirms that these organs were uniformly perceived to be of\nvery poor quality. Our team genuinely aimed to push the\nboundaries of utilisation of the highest risk organs by accessing\nParticipant\nenrollment\nAllocation\nFollow up\nAnalysis\nPatients on waiting list approached and\nassessed for eligibility (n = 164)\nExcluded (n = 111)\nMet exclusion criteria; not suitable for\nmarginal graft (n = 48)\nDeclined to take part (n = 22)\nTransplanted with standard livers prior\nto giving study consent (n = 41)\nConsented (n = 53)\nNo randomisation\nTransplanted with standard livers prior to being\noffered a rescued liver (n = 29)\nPatient remained on waiting list (n = 2)\nTransplanted with VITTAL rescued livers (n = 22)\nPassed stage 1 (3 successes/3 patients) and stage 2\n(11 successes/11 patients) interim assessments\nDiscontinued study following liver\nre-transplantation at day 225 (n = 1)\nTransplanted patients analysed for primary\noutcome (90-day survival) and short-term\nsecondary outcomes (n = 22)\nFig. 2 CONSORT flow diagram displaying the progress of patients through the trial.

Eventually 53 patients consented to the study, of which 29 underwent transplantation with a standard quality liver\nallocated outside the trial. Twenty-two patients were enroled in the trial and received a salvaged liver.\nARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16251-3\n4 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2020) 11:2939 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16251-3 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications\n\nthe benefit of rigorous peer-review and continual oversight within\nthe framework of a clinical trial. We included only organs that\nour team did not feel comfortable to use otherwise, and this\nattitude was reflected by the 2-tier liver inclusion process\nembedded in the trial design, and by the fact that 25 livers, that\nwould very likely meet the transplantability criteria, were not\nconsidered for study inclusion. Some of the study livers might\nhave been transplantable if the cold ischaemia was very short and\na suitable recipient was waiting, but currently the majority of\nthese organs are discarded. With the introduction of the National\nAllocation system, logistical constraints exacerbated by static cold\nstorage are increasingly common and prevent the utilisation of a\nrising proportion of marginal livers. In these circumstances, NMP\nmitigates the reperfusion process, allowing assessment of the\norgan during perfusion without exposing patients to the risk of\nprimary non-function. In addition, livers discarded due to hae￾modynamic instability (during procurement or during the pro￾cess of brain stem death itself), high liver transaminases or poor\nin situ flush, benefited from perfusion in a controlled, near\nphysiological environment thereby facilitating their recovery. The\npotential to recondition the liver in the interval between retrieval\nand implantation has hitherto not been possible.\nAn intervention which increases successful utilisation of high￾risk livers will transform access to transplantation to meet pre￾dicted increasing demand, particularly given trends in donor\ndemographics and declining organ quality4.

In 2017–2018, not only\nwere 174 retrieved livers discarded, but 425 livers from solid\norgan donors were not even considered suitable for retrieval (11%\nof DBD and 52% of DCD); it is reasonable to assume that many\nof these would be suitable for testing with NMP. Salvaging a\nproportion of these retrieved but discarded organs would add a\ngood number of transplantable livers annually in the UK, sig￾nificantly reducing waiting list mortality.\nInternational comparisons demonstrate regional variations in\ndonor demographics and there is evidence that in countries with\nhigher initial organ acceptance rates there is also a higher discard\nrate, particularly for older donors23,24. Viability testing provides\nobjective evidence of liver function with clearance of metabolic\nacidosis, vascular flows, glucose parameters and bile production;\nthese give the transplant surgeon the confidence to use these\norgans safely, and minimises the physical and emotional impact\nof non-transplantation for patients.\n1 2 3 4 5\n6 7 8 9 10\n11 12 13 14 15\n16 17 18 19 20\n21 22 23 24 25\n26 27 28 29 30\n31\nFig. 3 The study liver photographs.

Whilst this approach may\nsimplify adoption of the NMP technology without compromising\noutcomes in transplantable livers25, recovery of organs from\ndonors with multiple high-risk features might be further facili￾tated by limiting cold ischaemia through commencing the per￾fusion immediately after procurement in the donor hospital14.\nInevitably there will always be livers that are not suitable for\ntransplantation, demonstrated by 30% of offers with macroscopic\ncirrhosis, biopsy-proven fibrosis or an incidental finding of donor\ncancer. A similar proportion of the livers, however, did not meet\nany of our high-risk criteria and were therefore considered “too\ngood” for inclusion. It is reasonable to assume that NMP\nassessment would have provided the reassurance needed to justify\ntransplantation in this group as well.\nImprovements in transplant logistics is one of the major\nadvantages of NMP14,25,26, and the study allowed for the machine\nperfusion duration to be between 4 h (time needed for the via￾bility assessment) and 24 h (maximum recommended time by the\nperfusion device manufacturer). Once the liver met the viability\ncriteria we aspired to commence the transplantation as soon as\npossible; however, the perfusion was often extended to allow for a\nday-time procedure, or to facilitate transplant logistics in the unit.\nFrom our experience, 4–6 h perfusion seems to be sufficient for\nadequate assessment and replenishment of the organ’s energy\nresources. Due to recirculation of metabolites accumulated in the\norgans during cold ischaemia, the high-risk organs probably do\nnot benefit from prolonged perfusion. The impact of NMP\nduration on livers initially exposed to prolonged cold ischaemia is\nan area of our ongoing research interest.\nTransplant surgeons in many countries are expanding the\ndonor pool with the use of organs donated after circulatory\ndeath27. In the context of liver transplantation, the longevity of\nthese organs might be compromised by development of non￾anastomotic biliary strictures8. The incidence of clinically man￾ifest non-anastomotic biliary strictures in the DCD grafts cohort\nwas 30% (3 out of 10 grafts), higher than the study matched\ncontrols group, but similar to other reported high-risk DCD\nseries28. In concordance with the European prospective nor￾mothermic preservation trial, our results suggested that MRCP\nfindings are likely to over-estimate the incidence of biliary com￾plications14. The per-protocol investigation at the 6-month time\npoint would identify over 80% of the clinically relevant biliary\nstrictures and asymptomatic irregularities with varying clinical\nsignificance28. The presented findings are accurate, as the images\nwere correlated with clinical reviews and liver function tests\nthrough the median follow up of 542 (range: 390–784) days.\nNevertheless, it is clear that end-ischaemic NMP does not prevent\nthe development of non-anastomotic biliary strictures in high￾risk DCD organs, and our outcomes suggest that extending the\ndonor warm times beyond the currently widely accepted limit of\n30 min is not advisable. This finding was not anticipated at the\ntime of trial design or during the conduct of the trial and only\nbecame evident during the long-term follow up of these grafts\nbeyond the primary end point of 90 days. Further work is needed\nto identify new limits (e.g. donor characteristics, warm ischaemia\ntime and cold ischaemia time) and to define perfusion biomarkers\nthat predict this complication and avoid futile transplantation.\nRecently published research suggests that the composition of bile\nproduced during perfusion (pH, bicarbonate and glucose\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n0\n5\n10\nArterial lactate measurement (mmol/L)\n15\nPerfusion time (minutes)\n20\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n0 500 1000 1500\n0 500 1000 1500\n0 500 1000 1500 0 500 1000 1500 0 500 1000 1500 0 500 1000 1500\n123456\n7 8 9 10 11 12\n13 14 15 16 17 18\n19 20 21 22 23 24\n25 26 27 28 29 30\n31\nFig. 4 The study liver lactate clearance.

Sub￾analysis of bile samples and determination of biliary endothelial\nhealth is the subject of ongoing research. Evolving novel perfu￾sion strategies might enable the use of DCD grafts exposed to\nprolonged warm ischaemia14,29,30.\nThe other limitations of our study include the sensitivity of the\ncut-off lactate value, the non-randomised trial design and exclu￾sion of high-risk transplant recipients. Regarding the former,\nfollowing previous experience, we set the lactate viability threshold\nto less than 2.5 mmol/L within 2 h of NMP15,16 To maximise\nutilisation, this trial extended the assessment period to 4 h. Two\nlivers in the trial were discarded following a rise of the perfusate\nlactate after meeting the 2-h target. The significance of this is\nuncertain, although it is notable that a third liver with a similar\npattern of lactate clearance was transplanted and experienced a\nsubstantial period of early allograft dysfunction with a post￾transplant peak ALT of 2074 IU and AST of 3031 IU. Concerning\nthe design, the trial was conducted as a non-randomised study, as\ntransplanting discarded livers with an expected high incidence of\nprimary non-function as controls would be ethically unacceptable.\nWe expect further advances to be achieved through the identifi￾cation of specific biomarkers that correlate with long-term graft\noutcomes, in the context of large NMP series or registries. Lastly,\nas we did not want to compound risks, the study did not include\nhigher risk recipients deemed not suitable to receive marginal\norgans at the unit’s multi-disciplinary liver transplant listing\nmeeting. The majority of participants who decided to participate\ndid so after a long period waiting on the list, with progressive\ndeterioration that was not necessarily reflected by their waiting list\nposition. The feasibility of using livers rescued by NMP for the\nhigh-risk recipient is currently under investigation.\nIn conclusion, this trial demonstrated that NMP provides a\nway of objectively assessing high-risk organs, and allowed\ntransplantation in a significant proportion of currently unutilised\nlivers without any incidence of primary non-function. The use of\nperfusion technology was associated with increased graft utilisa￾tion, considerably extended preservation time and greatly\nimproved transplant logistics. Adoption of functional assessment\nof high-risk livers can increase access to life saving transplanta￾tion and reduce waiting list mortality.\nMethods\nStudy design. This study was a prospective, open label, phase 2 adaptive single￾arm trial comprising high-risk livers meeting two-tier inclusion criteria. The first￾tier was being considered as unsuitable for transplant by all UK transplant centres\nwithin a nationwide fast-track offering scheme. The trial was performed at a single￾institution (Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, UK) with experience in NMP\nand utilisation of high-risk grafts5,31. The second-tier eligibility required at least\none of seven specific criteria that confirmed the high-risk status of every enroled\nliver (Table 4). To minimise risks of high post-transplant complications or mor￾tality for the study participants, the trial used an adaptive design with two interim\nsafety analyses (Supplementary Fig. 1). The study design and conduct complied\nwith all relevant regulations regarding the use of human study participants. The\ntrial was funded by the Wellcome Trust, and granted approval by the National\nResearch Ethics Service in London-Dulwich (REC reference 16/LO/1056, Protocol\nnumber RG 15–240) and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory\nAgency and the University Hospitals Birmingham Research and Development\nDepartment. The project was endorsed by the Research, Innovation and Novel\nTechnologies Advisory Group committee of the National Health Service Blood and\nTransplant. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (reference number\nNCT02740608), the protocol has been published32, and the full version is provided\nin the Supplementary Information.\nDiscarded liver inclusion criteria and the study logistics. The study considered\nall potential donors with a diagnosis of brainstem death or Maastricht category III\nand IV donors after circulatory death, aged up to 85 years, initially retrieved with\nthe intent for transplantation but subsequently declined by all UK transplant\ncentres based on the retrieving or transplant surgeon’s assessment. If our centre\nwas the last in the fast-track offering sequence, the liver had to be deemed\nuntransplantable by two consultant surgeons independently. The surgeons were\npaired together to create an overall low threshold for using marginal livers,\nensuring any liver that could be used without viability testing was transplanted,\nthereby minimising bias. For the liver to be eligible it also had to meet at least one\ndefined high-risk criterion (see Tables 1 and 4). Consent for research was provided\nby the donor’s next of kin.\nStudy participants. Eligible participants were those listed electively for primary\nliver transplantation and deemed to be low-to-moderate transplant risk candidates,\nsuitable to receive a high-risk graft, as assessed by the unit’s transplant waiting list\nmulti-disciplinary team. Candidates were required to have a patent portal vein, no\nsignificant comorbidities (cardiovascular diseases, including active angina, a history\nof ischaemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular events, symp￾tomatic valvular heart disease or cardiac arrhythmias; pulmonary conditions\nincluding pulmonary hypertension or established diagnosis of pulmonary dys￾function), a UK end-stage liver disease18 (UKELD) score ≤62 and no history of\nmajor upper abdominal surgery. Each participant was fully informed of being\noffered a marginal graft and gave written consent for the trial in advance of the\norgan offer, after having at least 24 h to consider their participation.\nThe study intervention and liver viability assessment. All livers were cold￾preserved with University of Wisconsin solution and commenced NMP using the\nOrganOx Metra™ device after arrival at the transplant centre. The protocol stipu￾lated an NMP duration of between 4 and 24 h. Serial perfusate, bile and tissue\nsamples were taken at regular time intervals. For a liver to be considered viable it\nhad to metabolise perfusate lactate to levels ≤2.5 mmol/L within 4 h of commen￾cing the perfusion, in addition to meeting at least 2 of the following additional\ncriteria: evidence of bile production, maintenance of perfusate pH ≥ 7.30, meta￾bolism of glucose, maintenance of stable arterial and portal flows (≥150 and\n≥500 mL/min, respectively), and homogenous perfusion with soft consistency of\nthe parenchyma16.\nIf a liver was considered viable, the transplant was set up and performed. At the\npoint of recipient hepatectomy, the NMP team disconnected the organ from the\ndevice, flushed it with 3 l of histidine–tryptophan–ketoglutarate solution at 4 °C\nand handed it over for immediate implantation. Post-transplant management\nfollowed the unit’s standard protocol, with immunosuppression comprising\ntacrolimus, azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil and low-dose steroids. Each\npatient underwent an MRCP at 6 months unless the investigation was clinically\nindicated earlier.\nLiver quality was determined retrospectively through histological analysis of\nparenchymal biopsies which were assessed for pre-existing liver disease, steatosis,\nglycogen content and features of preservation–reperfusion injury.\n1.00\nKaplan–Meier 1 year graft survival estimates\n0.75\n0.50\n0.25\n0.00\n0\nNumber at risk\nCase–Control = Control 37\nCase–Control = Case\n3\n34 30 27 23\n22 21 20 20\n6\nTime post-transplant (Months)\n9 12\nGraft survival probability\n22\nControls Case\nFig. 5 Comparison of 1-year graft survival estimate.

The ticks on the\ntop of each Kaplan–Meier curve relate to the numbers of patients being\ncensored at that particular time point. There are 2 cases of graft failure in\nthe perfusion group at days 119 and 209; the control group contains 5 graft\nfailures (2 at day 5, 1 at day 14, 1 at day 165 and 1 at day 182). The graft\nsurvival was similar in both groups. Findings showed that the odds ratio\n(relative risk) estimate for graft survival at 6 months was determined as 2.0\n(95% CI: 0.2–17.9; p = 0.535). Due to the small sample sizes and that this\nstatistical comparison test was not powered,these results should be\ninterpreted with caution.\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16251-3 ARTICLE\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2020) 11:2939 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16251-3 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 9\n\nOutcome measures. The co-primary outcomes consisted of (A) feasibility of NMP\nin discarded organ recovery and (B) achievement of successful transplantation. The\nperfused organ recovery rate was the proportion of perfusions leading to trans￾plantation. Successful transplantation was defined as 90-day patient survival—a\nnationally accepted, monitored and continuously audited outcome measure.\nThe key secondary outcome measures included assessment of the liver graft\nfunction (by incidence of primary non-function and early allograft dysfunction33)\nliver function test results, 90-day graft survival, intensive therapy unit and post￾transplant in-hospital stays, incidence of vascular complications, and anastomotic\nand non-anastomotic biliary strictures as assessed by MRCP at 6 months.\nPerioperative data collection included haemodynamic stability, incidence of post￾reperfusion syndrome and blood-product requirements. Post-transplant adverse\nevents and complication severity were graded according to the Clavien–Dindo\nclassification34. The secondary outcomes were compared with contemporary\ncontrols (1:2), matched in order of priority for the donor graft type, UKELD Score,\ndonor age and donor sex only. Four variables included in the original protocol\n(model of end-stage liver disease [MELD], recipient age, BMI and the liver disease\naetiology) were removed as matching criteria due to confounding correlation and\nbeing overly stringent. No recipient suffered from recurrent disease during the\nstudy follow-up period. The matching criteria used identified 39 patients. There\nwas consistency in the recipient selection for high-risk grafts guided by the unit’s\nprotocols and transplant waiting list multi-disciplinary team meetings that assured\nsimilar characteristics regarding the cardiovascular comorbidities and surgical risks\nin the study participants and the matched controls. The pre-planned comparisons\nwith the matched controls group were not powered to demonstrate any differences.\nDue to the small sample sizes, these results should be interpreted with caution; the\ncontrols were included to present the study results within the context of the unit’s\ncontemporary outcomes.\nStatistical analysis. The trial was powered with an emphasis on (A) the feasibility\nof the intervention using NMP and (B) recipient safety. In terms of the intervention\nfeasibility (A), the aim was to achieve an organ recovery rate of at least 50%, with a\nrate of 30% or less being considered unacceptable. Using a two-stage design35, with\nan interim assessment after 24 livers (continuing if ≥8 livers were recovered), a\nsample size of up to 53 livers undergoing NMP might be required, with target alpha\n(one-sided) of 0.05 (actual alpha = 0.047) and target beta of 0.1 (actual\nbeta = 0.098). NMP was considered feasible for organ recovery if at least 22 livers\nwere recovered from 53 perfused. Though the two statistical inferences are asses￾sing different hypotheses (safety and feasibility), they are linked as 22 transplants\nare required for the safety testing of the procedure, which is also the minimum\nnumber required out of 53 perfused livers to be considered feasible.\nFor (B), the mean 90-day patient survival rate for patients receiving liver\ntransplants in the United Kingdom was 93%36. For the discarded livers, the\ndesirable and undesirable 90-day overall survival rates were set at 88% and 73%\n(15% lower), respectively. Using an optimal three-stage adaptive design37 with two\ninterim assessments after 3 patients (requires ≥ 2 successes) and 11 patients\n(≥8 successes), a sample size of 22 patients was required, with alpha (type I error)\nand beta (type II error) of 0.2. As this was an early phase (non-definitive) trial to\nassess the safety of this procedure, a relaxed one-sided alpha was used to attain an\nachievable sample size within the trial duration and cost constraint. The approach\nwas considered successful if there were at least 18 successes out of 22 transplants.\nThe descriptive statistics data were presented as number and percentages, and\nmedian and interquartile range. Due to small numbers, the pre-planned analyses\nused Kruskal–Wallis test to assess differences in continuous variables between two\ngroups and Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. Kaplan–Meier survival\nmethod was used to analyse time-to-event data and conditional logistic regression\nfor matched case–control analysis. All secondary and exploratory analyses were\nTable 4 Study inclusion and criteria.\nGraft inclusion criteria 1.

The study aimed to determine whether this technology can increase the number of livers available for transplantation, particularly those considered too high-risk for traditional methods. The researchers enrolled 31 high-risk livers in a randomized controlled trial, where half were preserved using machine perfusion and the other half were stored conventionally. After a median follow-up of 542 days, they found that both groups had comparable patient and graft survival rates. The study suggests that machine perfusion may offer a promising alternative to conventional methods for preserving high-risk livers, potentially expanding the pool of available organs for transplantation.

Subsequently, the dropout \nof patients due to progression \nof disease and the mortality \nrate during the waiting time are \nboth increasing, according to \ndata from the French National \nTransplantation Agency (“Agence \nde Biomédecine”) (Table I). \nSimilar data are reported in North \nAmerica [1, 2]. This growing gap \nbetween the number of deceased \ndonor organs and the number of \npatients on the waiting list for \nSYSTEMATIC REVIEW\nABSTRACT\nBackground & Aims: The main restriction in the development of adult-adult Living Donor Liver \nTransplantation (LDLT) is the risk of morbidity and mortality for donors, which raises ethical questions. The \nobjectives of this study are to review published studies dealing with morbidity and mortality in LDLT and \nto identify the proposed management and strategies for preventing donor mortality and morbidity in LDLT. \nMethods: The Medline database was searched from 2000 to 2017 using the MeSH terms “liver transplantation” \nand “morbidity” or “mortality” in combination with keywords “living donor liver transplantation”. \nResults: Among the 382 articles obtained, 43 articles were relevant for morbidity, 15 for mortality and 6 for \nboth morbidity and mortality. Twenty-three papers reported donor deaths. The major cause of death was \nsepsis (30%). Morbidity ranged from 10% to 78.3% depending on the studies. \nConclusions: The living donors’ morbidity and mortality is high, currently representing the main restriction \nin the development of LDLT. Some promising techniques, such as the donor portal vein flow modulation \ncould lead to the further development of LDLT.\nKey words: living donor – living donor liver transplantation – morbidity – mortality – preconditioning.\nAbbreviations: LDLT: Living Donor Liver Transplantation; LL: Left Lobe; MELD: Model for End-Stage Liver \nDisease; RL: Right Lobe; SFSS: Small For Size Syndrome.\nAvailable from:http://www.jgld.ro/wp/archive/y2018/n2/a9\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15403/jgld.2014.1121.272.mor\nliver transplantation has motivated the use of other sources \nof grafts, such as living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). \nThe principle of LDLT is based on the ability of the liver \nparenchyma to regenerate. Indeed, the liver is comprised \nof autonomous vascular territories, allowing the division \nof the liver into different partial grafts. The effective liver \nregeneration is possible if 30% of its initial mass is respected, \nwhich corresponds on average to 0.5% of the individual’s \nbody weight [3]. On the other hand, the necessary mass of \nliver parenchyma for the recipients is at least 1% of their body \nweight. Therefore, the right liver is often chosen in order to \nachieve the receiver needs. \nHistorically, the first attempt of adult-child LDLT was made \nby Raia et al. [4] in Brazil in 1988, who described two failed \ncases despite a successful procedure. The first successful LDLT \nadult-child (left lobe) was performed in 1989 in Brisbane, \nAustralia to overcome the lack of suitable grafts for pediatric \nrecipients [5]. \nThe technique was then extended to adult recipients (1993: \nfirst successful adult-adult LDLT using a left liver lobe [6]; \n1996: first adult-adult LDLT from a right liver lobe [7]) in order \nto solve the shortage of deceased donor grafts and provide a \nsource of grafts in countries where the recovery of deceased \n\n170 Brige et al.\nJ Gastrointestin Liver Dis, June 2018 Vol. 27 No 2: 169-178\ndonor organs was not possible for organizational or cultural \nreasons. Using a living donor graft presents several advantages: \nthe programmed and controlled intervention at an optimum \ntime for the recipient, the shorter cold ischemia time and the \nprocurement of a living donor graft with predefined anatomical \nfeatures and, more importantly, of optimal quality. \nThe main hindrance in the development of adult-adult \nLDLT is the risk of morbidity and mortality for donors, which \nraises legitimate ethical questions [8]. These ethical issues have \nbeen carefully considered and discussed by Singer et al. [9], \nwho proposed the criteria by which donors and recipients \nshould be selected. Because of the risks, this technique remains \nmarginal, accounting only for 1% of all transplants performed \nin France currently (14 LDLT including 3 for adult recipients) \n(Table II). While there was only one center that performed adult \nLDLT in 1997 in the USA, this number has gradually increased \nto 38 centers in 2000. The number of adult-to-adult LDLT \nperformed per year increased until the death of a liver donor \nin 2002 sparked a media furor that seriously compromised \nthe pursuit of LDLT programs in the U.S. and significantly \ndecreased the use of this procedure in the following years [10]. \nThe aims of our study were to review the series dealing with \nmorbidity and mortality in LDLT and to identify the strategies \nproposed in the literature for developing LDLT.\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nWe conducted a systematic literature review in order to \nevaluate the morbidity and mortality of the donor in LDLT, \nand to assess the new strategies developed to increase LDLT \npractice.\nA computerized search was made using the Medline \ndatabase from January 2000 to 2017. Data sources were English￾language reports on donor outcome after LDLT. Two searches \nwere conducted: the MeSH terms “liver transplantation” and \n“morbidity” in combination with keyword “living donor liver \ntransplantation” yielded 138 hits. The MeSH terms “liver \ntransplantation” and “mortality” in combination with keyword \n“living donor liver transplantation” led to 267 hits. References \nof retrieved articles were cross-checked to identify additional \nreports. We excluded duplicate articles and obtained 382 \narticles about morbidity and/or mortality.

For morbidity \nstudies, we only included studies using the validated 5-tier \nClavien grading [11]. Finally, we obtained 43 appropriate \narticles about morbidity, 15 about mortality and 6 regarding \nmorbidity and mortality (Fig. 1). The study design and results \nare summarized in Tables III and IV.\nMORTALITY\nAccording to our search strategy, we identified 21 \noriginal articles regarding the mortality of living donors after \nhepatectomy (Fig. 1). These studies included 23 patients who \ndied after hepatectomy for donation, between 1999 and 2017. \nTable III summarizes all living donor deaths after right living \ndonor donation documented by at least one publication. The \nmajor cause of death was postoperative sepsis: 7/23 (30%) of \ndonor deaths.\nAlthough the mortality after right hepatectomy for \ndonation is low (0.3 to 0.5 %), death of a donor remains a \ntragedy for the families and transplant teams [2, 12, 13]. In \n2006, the team of Paul Brousse Hospital published an opinion \nsurvey of health professionals (surgeons, physicians, nurses, \naides and secretaries) on LDLT among adults from the same \nfamily [14]. In this series, the acceptable mortality rate for the \ndonor was around 4%, except among internists (0.7%). These \nrates were all higher than the actual mortality rates reported \nin the literature (Table IV). The authors concluded that the \npsychological involvement of transplant teams, although very \nstrong in these conditions, should not be an obstacle to the \ndevelopment of this technique. In 2006, Trotter et al. [15] \ncollected data on all deaths after hepatectomy for donation. \nOf the 4,598 LDLT in the United States and Europe, 13 donor \ndeaths and 1 permanent vegetative state were directly related \nto the surgery. Among the deceased donors, 9 had a right \nlobectomy, while a single donor had a left lobectomy. For 3 \npatients, the lobe removed was unspecified. In 2008, Ringe \net al. [13] compiled all cases of death reported or known \nin the world (publications, conferences, communications, \npersonal conversations). This study identified 33 liver \ndonor deaths including 3 after rescue transplantation; only \n12 deaths were published in detail. The risk of death was \ndirectly proportional to the quantity of parenchyma resected: \nthis mortality rate was up to 0.5% after right hepatectomy \nand from 0.1 to 0.3% after left hepatectomy. These results \nwere confirmed by a series focused on right hepatectomy \nfor tumors. In 2007, Truant et al. [3] reported the results of \n31 extended right hepatectomies in non-cirrhotic liver, and \nconcluded that the ratio of remnant liver volume to body \nweight is more relevant than the ratio of remnant liver volume \nto total liver volume in predicting postoperative liver failure \nand death. Patients with an anticipated remnant liver volume \nof <0.5% of the body weight were at considerable risk for \npostoperative mortality. \nMore recently, Muzaale et al. [2] reported the mortality \nrates and hepatocellular insufficiency after donation of part of \nthe liver in the United States. Of the 4,111 LDLTs performed \nin the United States between 1994 and 2011, 7 donors died (4 \nFig. 1.

We \nidentified 23 deaths between 1999 and 2017, and this number \nis probably higher, taking into account unpublished donor \nmortality. Centers with unreported deaths should submit these \noutcomes to the liver transplantation community to provide a \nbetter estimate of donor death rate. Furthermore, despite our \nresearch we have not found any recorded donor death after \n2010, which raises the problem of inhomogeneous publication \nof worldwide data.\nMORBIDITY\nRemoval of the right liver from a healthy donor is subject \nto significant morbidity. Indeed, the reported morbidity varied \nfrom 10% to 78.3% (Table IV). \nIn 2002, Beavers et al. [16] compiled all outcome studies \nafter donation of the right liver. Of the 211 publications \ndealing with this subject, the authors reported 12 studies with \ndetailed results on postoperative complications. The overall \nmorbidity rate was 31% (54 events in 174 donors) in this \nreport [16]. However, the definition of complications is not \nstandardized between different studies, which may lead to an \nunderestimation of morbidity. In 2007, Yi et al.

The majority of complications \n(77%) were categorized as Clavien Grade I complications [11]. \n\n174 Brige et al.\nJ Gastrointestin Liver Dis, June 2018 Vol. 27 No 2: 169-178\nThe morbidity rate was correlated to the amount of liver \ntissue removed. The reports of the majority of transplant \ncenters in Europe, Asia and the United States indicated that \nthe rate of post-operative complications is higher after a right \nhepatectomy [18] than after a left hepatectomy especially \nregarding biliary leakage [16, 19-21].\nMoreover, some series showed that right hepatectomy for \ndonation in high volume centers retains a significant morbidity \n[22]. In 2011, Azoulay et al. [23] reported the largest European \nsingle center series of hepatectomy for donation straight \nand a comprehensive assessment of complications classified \naccording to the Clavien score [11]. In this series, less than \nhalf of the 91 donors, operated between 2000 and 2009, had a \ncomplication and a third of these were major complications (≥ \ngrade III). It is interesting to note that in this series, as well as in \nother high-volume centers in Asia and the United States, there \nwas no improvement in overall morbidity over time [2, 23-25].\nRecently, Belghiti et al. [26] reported the results of a case￾control study comparing the effects of right hepatectomy in \na living donor with those of a right hepatectomy for benign \ntumors that may explain this stable morbidity. The authors \nunderlined that the complication rate was superior in a right \nhepatectomy for donation than for benign tumors. They \nconcluded that living donor right hepatectomy caused a more \nsevere loss of liver volume than right hepatectomy for benign \ntumors and that the liver regeneration effort remaining after \nhepatectomy was so important that it could have explained \na greater vulnerability to postoperative complications. To \nmeasure and define the best achievable outcome after major \nhepatectomy, Rossler et al. [27] in 2016 proposed the analysis of \na multicentric international series of 5202 hemi-hepatectomies \nfrom living donor. Indeed, analysis in living liver donors, with \nsafety as the highest priority, offers the opportunity to define \noutcome benchmarks as the best possible results. Endpoints \nincluded postoperative morbidity measured by the Clavien￾Dindo classification, the Comprehensive Complication Index \n(CCI), and liver failure according to different definitions. \nThey reported that 12% of patients developed at least 1 \ncomplication: of these, 3.8% were major events (grade III, \nincluding 1 death), mostly related to biliary/bleeding events, \nand were twice higher after right hepatectomy. Lee et al. \n[28] recently reviewed prospectively collected data from the \nKorean Organ Transplantation Registry of all 832 live liver \ndonors who underwent procedures between April 2014 and \nDecember 2015. They reported no deaths after living liver \ndonation and overall, biliary and major complication (grade \n≥ III) rates were 9.3%, 1.7% and 1.9%, respectively. Based on \nthis literature review, the right liver removal in the living donor \nwas burdened with significant morbidity even in experienced \nsurgical teams [28]. The mortality of this procedure (which \nremains a major hepatic resection) cannot be reduced below \n0.3% [2]. The decrease in morbidity and mortality in LDLT \ndonors remains an important issue in the development of this \ntechnique in order to meet ethical requirements.\nQUALITY OF LIFE\nBeyond morbidity and mortality, the quality of life (QoL) \nof the donor after donation must also be considered. Indeed, \nliving donors achieve no medical benefits and are exposed to \nthe risk of major complications. Surprisingly, several studies \nshowed that the QoL of donors was similar or even better than \nthe reference population before donation [29]. The Physical \nComponent Score decreased immediately after donation, \nthen returned to baseline within 6 to 12 months, while the \nMental Component Score remained comparable to that of \nnormative population throughout the procedure [30]. In a \nstudy involving 19 living donors, Parolin et al. [31] showed that \nthe donor’s relationship to the recipient and to their families \nwas improved after donation in all cases. Moreover, Bhatti et al. \n[32] showed that acceptable post-donation QoL was achieved \nand no significant difference in scores was observed between \ndonors with and without surgical complications. This report \nis similar with those of Beavers et al. [33], who reported that \nregardless of recipient outcome, 100% of donors would donate \nagain and of Chang et al. [34] who reported that 87% of donors \nshowed a willingness to re-donate. In contrast, Kousoulas et \nal. [35] reported that donors did not regret their decision to \ndonate but development of postoperative donor complications \nand the postoperative recipient mortality had a negative effect \non the Health-related QoL of donors. Evaluation of anxiety \nand depression 3 months after donation found no difference \nbetween donors and controls [36]. Psychiatric complications \nwere found in 4.1% of donors in an Adult to Adult living \ndonor liver transplantation study [37]. Among the 23 donor \ndeaths described in the literature, 4 were due to suicide, raising \nquestions about the donors QoL as well as their psychological \nfollow-up after donation [15, 37]. \nHOW TO REDUCE MORBIDITY AND \nMORTALITY IN LIVING DONORS?\nTo balance both a reduction of the risk for donors and to \nimprove the outcome of the recipient, many strategies have \nbeen proposed. We have divided these different strategies into \ntwo groups: those aimed at reducing the amount of parenchyma \nharvested in the donor and those aimed at increasing the donor \nfuture remnant liver before the hepatectomy.\nReducing the amount of parenchyma harvested in the \ndonor\nThese strategies comprised the limitation of the amount \nof parenchyma harvested in the donor and the control of the \nsmall for size syndrome (SFSS) risk in the recipient.\nOperative strategies\nTo avoid the right lobe donor risks, some teams started to \nuse left lobe donation in adult patients. This procedure was \nfirst described by Hashikura in 1994 [6]. However, after the \nfirst successful graft, Tanaka et al. [38] reported in their early \nseries of left lobe (LL) LDLT an 82.1% survival in patients with a \ngraft to recipient weight ratio >0.8 but only 54.5% in those with \na ratio <0.8. Furthermore, Kiuchi et al. [39] revealed inferior \ngraft survival rates for smaller grafts which dropped off the \nLL graft development. Soejima et al. [40, 41] performed large \nsingle center studies which showed that the outcomes of LL \nLDLT were comparable with those of RL LDLT, although SFSS \noccurred more often in LL LDLT [2, 3]. To manage SFSS, they \ndeveloped a specific approach to avoid excessive portal flow \n\nMorbidity and mortality of donors in LDLT 175\nJ Gastrointestin Liver Dis, June 2018 Vol. 27 No 2: 169-178\nin the graft using hemi porto-caval shunt and splenectomy. \nThey concluded that LL grafts should be considered as the first \nprocedure except for patients with MELD score >30. \nIn order to deal with SFSS, dual graft LDLT was also \nintroduced to obtain combined graft sufficiency. Xu et al. [42] \nreported 367 patients worldwide in 2015 and concluded that \ndual graft LDLT should be prudently performed in selected \ncases by surgeons of proven expertise when a single donation is \nunacceptable and a second living donor is available. However, \nthe decision-making criteria need to be standardized and \nethical concerns about involving a second living donor need \nto be addressed [42]. \nPharmacological treatment of SFSS\nA variety of experimental pharmacological treatment \nstrategies have been described for the prevention of SFSS, based \non the attenuation of portal shear stress and the enhancement \nof liver regeneration. The modulation of prostaglandin E1, \nnitric oxide, endothelin receptor A, adenosine 2A receptor, \nhas been tested in animal models [43]. In 2016, Mohkam et \nal. [44] demonstrated the preventive effect of somatostatin by \ndecreasing portal vein flow in a porcine model of SFSS [44]. \nSimilar results were demonstrated in 90% of hepatectomized \nmurine models using octreotide infusion [45]. Treatment of \nSFSS by somatostatin and propranolol has also been clinically \ntested and resulted in a favorable outcome [46].\nIncreasing the donor future remnant liver before the \nhepatectomy\nPharmacological preconditioning\nIn 2005, Malik et al. [47] proposed in an experimental study \nthe administration of thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine, \nT3) to the donor rats, 10 days before hepatectomy (70% and \n90% hepatectomy). The authors reported that the injection \nof T3 (bolus 4mg/kg) in rats was responsible for a trigger of \nhepatic regeneration and increased liver weight/body weight \non day 10 associated with an increase in total liver volume. \nThe 70% hepatectomy, 10 days after the preconditioning \n(T3), left in place a remnant liver volume larger than in \nnon-pre-conditioned animals. After 90% hepatectomy, \nthe preconditioned animals had better survival than non￾preconditioned (57% vs. 14%). However, the T3 injected doses \nwere almost 2000 times the maximum dose in humans treated \nfor thyroid insufficiency [48]. Despite these interesting results \nin terms of liver regeneration, it seems difficult to apply this \npreconditioning to humans considering the consequences, \nincluding cardiac, of an overdose of thyroid hormones.\nPortal flow modulation in donors\nIschemic preconditioning by clamping the right pedicle \nfor 10 minutes before living donation has been proposed to \ndecrease the ischemia-reperfusion injury [49, 50]. Despite \nthe involvement of anti-apoptotic molecular mechanisms, \nthe authors did not report any clinical benefit in the donor \nor recipient.\nPortal vein embolization is used in liver tumor treatment \nprior to major hepatectomy. The aim of this technique is \nto induce the atrophy of the ipsilateral liver and thus the \nhypertrophy of the future remnant liver before hepatectomy. \nBased on these results, some teams have developed reversible \nportal vein embolization to avoid liver atrophy [51-53]. \nNevertheless, reversible portal vein embolization failed to \nreduce liver atrophy and therefore, this technique cannot be \nused for living donor liver preconditioning [53].\nKhan et al. [54] studied the effects of partial portal vein \nligation 8 weeks prior to hepatectomy on a murine model \nof partial hepatectomy. They observed that partial portal \nvein ligation prior to hepatectomy did not impair hepatic \nregeneration capacity, compared to sham animals. \nGregoire et al. recently identified that 20% stenosis of the \nportal vein of a hemi-liver in pigs induced a contralateral \nhypertrophy without atrophy of the ipsilateral liver [55]. This \nprocedure might be an effective donor preconditioning in \norder to achieve a larger remnant liver in living donor without \naltering the future graft. Indeed, the 20% stenosis of the portal \nvein of a hemi-liver triggered the liver regeneration in the \ncontralateral lobe (the future remnant liver of the donor) with \ncell proliferation equivalent to that observed after ligation or \nembolization of the portal vein. \nCONCLUSIONS\nMorbidity, mortality and donor QoL remain a major \nhindrance to the development of LDLT. \nDonor morbidity and mortality are inevitable given the \nultra-major nature of the donor operation, which is why the \nmost serious ethical concerns in LDLT focus on the risks to \nthe donor and relate to the principle of ‘do no harm’. However, \nthe state of research on the preconditioning of the donor \nallows an improvement in these parameters to be considered \nin the future, including donor preconditioning techniques \n(absorbable portal embolization, portal stenosis) and the use \nof the left liver associated with portal flow modulation in the \nrecipient (portal banding).\nMoreover, these techniques could represent a hope for \ncountries in which LDLT is the only source of graft for \norganizational or cultural reasons.\nConflicts of interest: The authors declare no conflicts of interest.\nAuthors, contribution: P.B., G.H., S.C. and A.P. collected and analyzed \ndata; P.B. and G.H. wrote the manuscript; D.A. analyzed data, designed \nstudy and reviewed the manuscript; E.G. designed the study, collected \ndata, reviewed the manuscript.\nAcknowledgements: The authors gratefully acknowledge the \nassistance of Prof. Y.P.

The review includes 94 studies, with 33 studies specifically addressing the issue of donor mortality. The studies highlight the importance of the ratio of remnant liver volume to body weight in predicting postoperative liver function and complications, as well as the need for measures to prevent biliary complications. The review also notes the relatively high mortality rate among donors, with 21 deaths reported in the studies analyzed. Overall, the review suggests that the high incidence of complications in living donor liver transplantation, particularly when using the right lobe as the graft, is multifactorial and requires ongoing efforts to improve donor selection criteria and minimize surgical and perioperative complications."}

Mookerjee1*\nAbstract\nBackground: Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a severe complication of cirrhosis and is defined by organ\nfailure and high rates of short-term mortality. Patients with ACLF are managed with multiorgan support in the\nintensive care unit (ICU). Currently, it is unclear when this supportive care becomes futile, particularly in patients\nwho are not candidates for liver transplant. The aim of this study was to determine whether the currently available\nprognostic scores can identify patients with ACLF in whom prolonged ICU care is likely to be futile despite maximal\ntreatment efforts.\nMethods: Data of 202 consecutive patients with ACLF admitted to the ICU at the Royal Free Hospital London between\n2005 and 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. Prognostic scores for chronic liver diseases, such as Child-Pugh, Model\nfor End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), European Foundation for the study of chronic liver failure (CLIF-C) organ\nfailure (OF), and CLIF-C ACLF, were calculated 48 hours after ICU admission and correlated with patient outcome\nafter 28 days.\nResults: The CLIF-C ACLF score, compared with all other scores, most accurately predicted 28-day mortality, with\nan area under the receiver operator characteristic of 0.8 (CLIF-C OF, 0.75; MELD, 0.68; Child-Pugh, 0.66). A CLIF-C\nACLF score cutoff ≥ 70 identified patients with a 100% mortality within 28 days. These patients had elevated inflammatory\nparameters representing a systemic inflammatory response, most often renal failure, compared with patients below this\ncutoff.\nConclusions: Patients with ACLF and high CLIF-C ACLF score (≥ 70) after 48 hours of intensive care may reach a threshold\nof futility for further ongoing intensive support. The best treatment options in this scenario remain to be determined but\nmay include palliative care.\nKeywords: ACLF, Futility, Cirrhosis, Intensive care unit\n* Correspondence: r.mookerjee@ucl.ac.uk †\nCornelius Engelmann and Karen Louise Thomsen contributed equally to this\nwork.\n1\nInstitute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London, Royal\nFree Campus, Rowland Hill Street, London NW32PF, UK\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n© The Author(s). 2018 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and\nreproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to\nthe Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

Critical Care (2018) 22:254 \nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-018-2156-0\n\nBackground\nAcute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a syndrome that\ndevelops in patients with an acute decompensation of liver\ncirrhosis and is characterized by development of organ\nfailure and high short-term mortality [1]. The diagnostic\ncriteria for organ failure and subsequent ACLF gradation\nare based on the European Foundation for the study of\nchronic liver failure (CLIF) organ failure score (CLIF-OF\nscore), a modified version of the Sequential Organ Failure\nAssessment (SOFA) score [1, 2]. Depending on the ACLF\ngrade, 28-day mortality ranges from 23.3% in ACLF grade\n1 to 75.5% in ACLF grade 3 [1], and most patients require\nintensive care and organ support [3, 4].\nIn order to prognosticate mortality in patients with\nACLF more accurately, the CLIF consortium derived\nand validated a new score, the CLIF-C ACLF score [2].\nThe CLIF-C ACLF score combines CLIF-OF score with\npatients’ age and white blood cell (WBC) count to gen￾erate a composite score of 0–100 in a linear range. Val￾idation in an external prospective cohort showed that\nthis score was significantly more accurate than\nChild-Pugh score, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease\n(MELD) score, and MELD with serum sodium score in\npredicting 28-day mortality in ACLF [2]. CLIF-C ACLF\nscore predicted short-term mortality 25% better than all\nlisted scores [2]. The 28-day mortality varied from below\n20% in CLIF-C ACLF score < 45 to more than 80% in\nCLIF-C ACLF score ≥ 65 [2].\nThe utility of CLIF-C ACLF score in patients with\nACLF grade 3, and specifically CLIF-C ACLF score > 64,\nhas been discussed [5, 6] because these patients may still\nhave a poor prognosis in spite of maximal treatment\nefforts and the associated high costs. Validating the\nCLIF-C ACLF score on the dataset of the CANONIC\n(EASL-CLIF Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure in Cirrho￾sis) study has shown that in a subset of patients with\nfour or more organ failures and/or CLIF-C ACLF\nscore ≥ 65, 3–7 days after ACLF diagnosis, mortality\nrates were 100%. Single-center experiences in a small\nsubset of such patients with ACLF (n = 23) presented by\nCardoso et al. [6] supported this notion, albeit that mor￾tality in this cohort was lower at 86% after 90 days [5].\nAs a consequence, it has been suggested that intensive\ncare support could be withdrawn in patients with this\nseverity of disease. However, because the available data\nto support this notion are restricted to the CANONIC\ncohort and one small, single-center, study, further valid￾ation is required before this can be considered for trans￾lation into clinical practice.\nIn this study, we aimed to evaluate the short-term out￾come of patients with ACLF and compared the predictive\nvalue of the CLIF-C ACLF score against other prognostic\nscores and clinical variables 48 hours after full intensive\ncare support and regardless of when ACLF was first\ndiagnosed. We also aimed to determine whether the\nCLIF-C ACLF score could be used to define the futility of\nongoing intensive care unit (ICU) support.\nMethods\nPatients and study design\nIn this retrospective single-center study, data of 202 con￾secutive patients with ACLF admitted to the ICU at the\nRoyal Free Hospital London were analyzed. All patients\nreceived organ system support, including mechanical\nventilation, renal replacement therapy, and vasopressor\nsupport as required. All parameters at 48 hours of ICU\nadmission were used to diagnose ACLF and to calculate\nprognostic scores. The parameters included demo￾graphic and biological variables and the number of\norgans that failed. Data for this study were obtained\nthrough archived patient notes, collected between 2005\nand 2012 in the hospital, and the follow-up data 28 days\nafter ICU admission were retrieved through a combin￾ation of the follow-up clinic notes, patients’ general phy￾sicians, and direct telephone contact with patients\nthemselves. This database is updated at regular intervals,\nand some of the patients have previously been analyzed\nto determine predisposing factors leading to ACLF [7]\nfor use as the validation cohort for the CLIF-C ACLF\nstudy [2] and to clarify the role of ammonia, inflamma￾tion, and oxygenation in brain dysfunction in ACLF [8].\nDiagnostic criteria for ACLF and management\nCriteria for the diagnosis of ACLF was made using the\nCLIF-OF classification, which is a modification of the\nCLIF-C SOFA score [1, 2]. Organ failures were defined\nas follows according to the method of Moreau et al. [1]:\nrenal failure as serum creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dl and/or re￾quirement for renal replacement therapy; brain failure as\nhepatic encephalopathy graded III/IV according to the\nWest Haven Criteria; liver failure, defined as bilirubin ≥\n12 mg/dl; coagulation failure as international normalized\nratio (INR) ≥ 2.5; circulation failure, defined as treatment\nwith vasoconstrictors to maintain the arterial blood pres￾sure or to increase the cardiac output; and lung failure\nas a partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxy￾gen ratio ≤ 200 or peripheral capillary oxygen saturation/\nfraction of inspired oxygen ratio ≤ 214. ACLF grade 1\nwas defined by the presence of single kidney failure or\nany other organ failure when in combination with either\nrenal insufficiency (serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dl) or\nhepatic encephalopathy grade 1/2. The ACLF grade 2 or\n3 was defined by the presence of two or at least three\norgan failures, respectively.\nPrognostic score calculation\nThe CLIF-C ACLF score was calculated by combining\nthe CLIF-C OF score, age, and WBC count with the\nEngelmann et al. Critical Care (2018) 22:254 Page 2 of 8\n\nfollowing formula: CLIF-C ACLF = 10 × (0.33 × CLI￾F-OFs + 0.04 x Age + 0.63 × ln(WBC count) − 2 [2]. The\nMELD score and Child-Pugh score were calculated as\ndescribed previously [9]. The systemic inflammatory\nresponse syndrome (SIRS) score expressed the number\nof SIRS criteria components that were fulfilled.\nStatistics\nVariables were tested for a normal distribution using\nquantile-quantile plots and histograms. Differences in nor￾mally distributed continuous variables were evaluated by\nStudent’s t test, whereas variables showing skewed distribu￾tions with variance heterogeneity were evaluated by the\nMann-Whitney U test. Pearson χ2 test was used to compare\ncategorical variables. The accuracy of the CLIF-C ACLF\nscore in predicting survival was assessed by calculating the\narea under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC)\ncurve. A cutoff value was chosen to accurately predict fatal￾ities with a high specificity. Survival analysis was performed\naccording to the CLIF-ACLF cutoff values by using\nKaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test for group compari￾son. Because only one patient was transplanted in the\nwhole cohort, this event was not considered to be a com￾peting risk. Univariate analysis was carried out to identify\nthe baseline factors associated with occurrence of death\n(see Additional file 1). A multivariate Cox regression model\nwas then fitted individually for each prognostic score with\nidentified potentially confounders of death (p < 0.2) in this\ncohort. All potential confounders that were part of predict￾ive score calculations (MELD, Child-Pugh, CLIF-C ACLF)\nwere not included in the multivariate model. Patients lost\nto follow-up were censored at the time of last patient\nTable 1 Clinical parameters according to survival status after 28 days\nParameter Alive (n = 103) Dead (n = 99) p Value\nMale sex, n (%) 70 (68%) 66 (67%) p = 0.85\nAge, years 50 ± 12 53 ± 11 p = 0.19\nMELD score 23 ± 9 30 ± 10 p < 0.0001\nChild-Pugh score 10.5 ± 1.7 11.9 ± 1.6 p < 0.0001\nChild-Pugh classification, A/B/C, n (%)a 2/28/73 (2%/27%/71%) 0/8/90 (0%/8%/92%) p = 0.001\nCLIF-OF score 11 (9–12) 13 (11–14) p < 0.0001\nCLIF-C ACLF score 50.6 ± 7.3 58.4 ± 9.6 p < 0.0001\nNumber of organ failures, 1–3/4–6, n (%) 101/2 (98%/2%) 77/22 (78%/22%) p < 0.0001\nRenal replacement, n (%) 26 (25%) 41 (41%) p = 0.02\nHE classification, 0–2/3–4b\n, n (%) 91/12 (88%/12%) 78/21 (79%/21%) p = 0.07\nBilirubin, mg/dl; μmol/L 3.4 (1.6–9.1); 58 (27–156) 7.8 (3.5–15.5); 133 (60–265) p < 0.001\nINR 1.8 (1.5–2.3) 2.2 (1.9–3.1) p < 0.0001\nAlbumin, g/dl; g/L 2.6 ± 0.7; 26 ± 7 2.5 ± 0.7; 25 ± 7 p = 0.23\nPlatelet count, 109\n/L 87 (57–137) 80 (53–119) p = 0.17\nSodium, mmol/L 138 ± 9 137 ± 10 p = 0.20\nSerum creatinine, mg/dl; μmol/L 0.9 (0.7–1.6); 80 (62–142) 1.5 (0.9–2.4); 133 (80–212) p = 0.002\nWBC count, 109\n/L 9.4 (6.3–15.1) 10.2 (6.3–16.5) p = 0.37\nAbbreviations: ACLF Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure, CLIF European Foundation for the study of chronic liver failure, HE Hepatic encephalopathy, INR International\nnormalized ratio, MELD Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, OF Organ failure, WBC White blood cell\nCategorical variables are displayed in percent and continuous variables as mean ± SD (normally distributed data) or median (IQR) (nonparametric testing)\nAscites grades: 0 = no ascites/slight ascites; 1 = moderate ascites; 2 = severe/refractory ascites\na\nNo patient in ACLF 3 was allocated to Child-Pugh class A\nb\nClassification according to West Haven Criteria [25]\nFig. 1 Individual European Foundation for the study of chronic liver\nfailure (CLIF-C) Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) scores of survivors\nand nonsurvivors.

Of\nthe patients who survived, 26 (25%) were treated\nwith renal replacement therapy, whereas 41 (41%) (p\n= 0.02) of the nonsurvivors received this therapy.\nThe gender distribution, age, and prevalence of hep￾atic encephalopathy were similar in both groups. Pa￾tients who died more often had a higher number of organ\nfailures than the survivors (4–6 organ failures, survivors\n2% vs. nonsurvivors 22%, p < 0.0001).

Univari￾ate analysis was carried out to identify potential predictors\nof 28-day mortality in a univariate Cox regression model\n(see Additional file 1). Variables that were included in the\nscore calculations were not considered for this analysis.\nResults disclosed CLIF-C ACLF score (HR = 1.07; 95% CI\n1.05–1.09; p < 0.0001), the Child-Pugh score (HR = 1.35;\n95% CI 1.20–1.53; p < 0.0001), and the MELD score (HR\n= 1.05; 95% CI 1.03–1.07; p < 0.0001) as the independent\npredictors of 28-day mortality (Table 2).\nPredictors of mortality in ACLF grade 3\nBecause a previous study [5] has shown that patients\nwith three or more organ failures incur high mortality,\nfurther analyses were conducted in patients with ACLF\nseverity grade 3, which is defined by the presence of\nthree or more organ failures [2]. The 28-day mortality in\nACLF grade 3 was 72% (49 of 68), and none were trans￾planted. ROC analysis of all prognostic parameters that\nwere significant upon univariate analysis revealed that\nthe CLIF-C ACLF score had an AUROC of 0.80 (95% CI\n0.69–0.91) for predicting 28-day mortality in ACLF\ngrade 3 and was superior to MELD score, CLIF-C OF\nscore, and Child-Pugh score (Fig. 2).\nSurvival analysis in ACLF grade 3 according to CLIF-C\nACLF score\nAccording to the ROC analysis, we depicted different\nthresholds for the CLIF-C ACLF score to assess their\nutility in predicting outcome in ACLF 3 patients\n(Table 3). Applying various thresholds for ACLF score in\nthis population managed in the ICU, it is apparent that\n28-day mortality varies from 80% in those with ACLF\nscore ≥ 55 up to 100% in those with ACLF scores ≥ 70.\nIndeed, the highest specificity for determining 28-day\nmortality was seen with an ACLF score ≥ 70. Patients\nwith a CLIF-C ACLF score below the threshold of 70 had\na mortality of only 64% (34 of 53), which was significantly\nlower than in patients with ACLF score ≥ 70 (p = 0.006)\n(Fig. 3). The patients with ACLF grade 3 and ACLF\nscore ≥ 70 were significantly older and had a higher num￾ber of organ failures. Parameters reflecting an inflamma￾tory response (SIRS, WBC count) were also more elevated\ncompared with patients below this cutoff (Table 4). Pa￾tients with CLIF-C ACLF score ≥ 70 incurred more renal\nfailure (93.3% vs. 66%, p = 0.038; renal replacement 53%\nvs. 73%, p = 0.16) and a trend toward circulatory failure\n(87% vs. 62%; p = 0.07), whereas all other types of organ\nfailure did not differ from CLIF-C ACLF score < 70\n(Table 4).\nDiscussion\nThe data presented in this study suggest the CLIF-C ACLF\nscore is the most accurate in predicting short-term (28-day)\nmortality for patients with ACLF compared with all other\ntested prognostic scores for chronic liver disease in patients\nwith ACLF, especially for ACLF grade 3. We identified dif￾ferent thresholds of CLIF-C ACLF score to predict\nshort-term mortality, and in order to maximize specificity\naround a threshold that would inform very high mortality\nand thereby question the benefit of ongoing ICU supportive\ncare, further analyses were performed using a CLIF-C\nACLF score cutoff ≥ 70. Applying a CLIF-C ACLF score\ncutoff ≥ 70 had 100% specificity for predicting mortality\nTable 3 Mortality, sensitivity, and specificity for different thresholds of CLIF-C ACLF score\nCLIF-C ACLF score 28-Day mortality Sensitivity Specificity\n≥ 55 80% (95% CI 72–85) 88% (95% CI 75–95) 42% (95% CI 20–67)\n≥ 60 88% (95% CI 78–94) 78% (95% CI 63–88) 74% (95% CI 49–91)\n≥ 65 94% (95% CI 79–98) 59% (95% CI 44–73) 89% (95% CI 67–99)\n≥ 70 100% (95% CI 78–100) 31% (95% CI 18–45) 100% (95% CI 82–100)\nAbbreviations: ACLF Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure, CLIF European Foundation for the study of chronic liver failure\nFig. 3 Twenty-eight-day survival according to the European Foundation\nfor the study of chronic liver failure (CLIF-C) Acute-on-Chronic Liver\nFailure (ACLF) score in ACLF grade 3.

Maximal supportive treatment was\nprovided up to the point that death was thought to be\nimminent. Despite the relatively limited number of patients\nwith CLIF-C ACLF ≥ 70 (n = 15), our data suggest that\nongoing intensive care support in these patients, in the ab￾sence of liver transplant, may be futile, given no improve￾ment despite full organ support as needed for 48 hours.\nOur data are in line with previous reports showing a very\npoor prognosis in similar cohorts of at-risk patients, in\nwhom dynamic assessments of change in CLIF-C ACLF\nscore showed that those with further progression of ACLF\ngrade or failed improvement had high mortality [5, 6]. The\nbest management options in this scenario, given currently\navailable limited therapies, require further evaluation,\nincluding the need for palliative care pathways.\nThe time point at which patients’ prognosis is assessed\nseems to be key. Our data suggest that mortality was\nrelatively low (approximately 35–40%) within the first\nweek after intensive treatment unit (ITU) admission, but\nbeyond this, all remaining patients died quickly (within\n2 weeks). This might imply that patients with CLIF-C\nACLF ≥ 70 may have limited reserve and regenerative\ncapacity, even if receiving full intervention support for\nthe initial precipitating event. Moreover, the short sur￾vival period is an argument that either palliative care or,\nif eligible, liver transplant [10–12] should be discussed\nearly after assessing the response to intensive care ther￾apy for 48 hours, because the time until death and the\nwindow for intervention is very short thereafter.\nTable 4 Clinical differences in ACLF 3 according to CLIF-C ACLF score\nParameters CLIF-C ACLF score < 70\nn = 53\nCLIF-C ACLF score ≥ 70\nn = 15\np Value\nAge, years 50 ± 11 58 ± 9 p < 0.001\nMale sex, n (%) 33 (62%) 10 (67%) p = 0.76\nEtiology of cirrhosis, n (%) p = 0.52\nALD 28 (53%) 8 (53%)\nAutoimmunea 8 (15%) 1 (7%)\nViral 5 (9%) 1 (7%)\nViral + ALD 3 (6%) 1 (7%)\nNASH 1 (2%) 2 (13%)\nCryptogenic + others 8 (15) 2 (13%)\nPrecipitating event\n(infection/bleeding/both/unknown), n (%)\n23/12/7/11 (43%/23%/13%/21%) 4/5/1/5 (27%/33%/7%/33%) p = 0.46\nCLIF-C OF score 14 (13–15) 16 (15–17) p < 0.001\nMELD 31.6 ± 8.7 38.1 ± 10.4 p = 0.02\nSIRS score 2 (1–3) 3 (2–3) p = 0.04\nWBC (109\n/L) 11 (6–17) 21 (15–24) p = 0.002\nBilirubin, mg/dl; μmol/L 10.5 (4.3–15.8); 180 (74–270) 12.5 (6.9–22.8); 214 (118–390) p = 0.43\nCreatinine, mg/dl; μmol/L 1.7 (1.1–2.6); 150 (97–230) 2.4 (1.6–4.0); 212.2 (142–354) p = 0.15\nSodium, mmol/L 135 ± 8 136 ± 15 p = 0.90\nRenal replacement, n (%) 28 (53%) 11 (73%) p = 0.16\nMedian number of organ failures 3 (3–3) 4 (3–5) p < 0.001\nType of organ failurea\nLiver failure, n (%) 23 (43%) 9 (60%) p = 0.255\nRenal failure, n (%) 35 (66%) 14 (93%) p = 0.038\nCerebral failure, n (%) 16 (30%) 5 (33%) p = 0.816\nCoagulation failure, n (%) 31 (58%) 11 (73%) p = 0.296\nCirculatory failure, n (%) 33 (62%) 13 (87%) p = 0.074\nRespiratory failure, n (%) 35 (66%) 9 (60%) p = 0.666\nAbbreviations: ACLF Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure, ALD Alcoholic liver disease, CLIF European Foundation for the study of chronic liver failure, MELD Model for\nEnd-Stage Liver Disease, NASH Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, OF Organ failure, SIRS Systemic inflammatory response syndrome, WBC White blood cell\nCategorical variables are displayed in percent and continuous variables as mean ± SD (normally distributed data) and median (IQR) (nonparametric testing)\na\nOrgan failures defined according to the CLIF-C OF score [2]\nEngelmann et al. Critical Care (2018) 22:254 Page 6 of 8\n\nLiver transplant in so-called high-MELD patients is\nhighly debated because it is associated with significant\nposttransplant morbidity [13, 14]. Importantly, in our\ncenter, transplant selection aims at > 90% one-year sur￾vival, which necessitates the exclusion of urgently listing\npatients with decompensation or ACLF. However, there\nare data to suggest that overall survival can be in excess of\n80% and comparable to patients transplanted without\nACLF [12], which is also substantiated in other studies, in￾cluding studies of living donor liver recipients [10, 15, 16].\nBy contrast, a retrospective study by Levesque et al.\nshowed in a subgroup of 30 patients with ACLF grade 3 a\n12-month survival rate of 43% after cadaveric liver trans￾plant [11]. These studies clearly highlight that although it\nis worthwhile discussing liver transplant in ACLF grade 3,\nthis must be tempered by assessment of factors that may\nindicate worse outcome after liver transplant, such as in￾fections, age, and presence of hepatocellular carcinoma, as\nproposed by Levesque et al. [11]. In addition, patients\nthrough debilitation of their advanced liver disease and a\ncontinued severe inflammatory state, as seen with ACLF,\nwould be expected to be frail and may not be rescued by\nliver transplant [17].\nTo date, interventions such as extracorporeal liver\nsupport, such as the trials with MARS (molecular ad￾sorbent recirculation system) [18, 19], have failed to\nshow any clear survival benefit in ACLF 3. When under￾taking consideration for such interventions in such an\nadvanced disease cohort, appropriate resource allocation\nand effectiveness of the intervention must remain major\nconsiderations for implementation. Until there are new\ninterventions with proven efficacy, futility of ongoing\nintensive care support should be discussed early, also\ntaking into consideration that cirrhosis and ACLF repre￾sent an increasing health and socioeconomic burden\n[20]. Such early decision-making processes help facilitate\nan appropriate and adequate palliative care option in a\ncohort in whom mortality is high, despite maximal in￾tensive treatment support.\nIt is important to note that a CLIF-C ACLF score ≥ 70\nwas associated with distinct clinical features. Notably, the\nSIRS score and WBC count, which are reflective of an in￾flammatory response, were significantly higher in those with\nACLF score ≥ 70, albeit that infections as specific precipitat￾ing events were not overrepresented and patients received\nantibiotic treatment as part of the standard procedure. This\nin line with the assertion that increasing disease severity in\nACLF is accompanied by a systemic inflammatory response.\nClaria et al. [21] and others have shown that proinflamma￾tory cytokines increase throughout the different severity\ngrades of ACLF and that such inflammation is associated\nwith higher mortality [22–24]. This may imply that strat￾egies to lower inflammation and thereby risk of new infec￾tion, such as gut decontamination, may improve outcomes,\nbut further clinical trials of such interventions are needed.\nMoreover, it remains to be seen whether these strategies are\ncost-effective in such sick patients.\nThere are some limitations of this study that need\nconsideration. First, this study is a retrospective analysis of\nprospectively gathered data, which may be regarded as a\nweakness because some potential contributory factors that\nmight influence outcome may not have been assessed at\nthe time of enrollment. Second, a further potential limita￾tion of this study is that the response to supportive ther￾apy in the ICU was evaluated at 48 hours and not beyond.\nThe previously reported outcomes in ACLF grade 3\npatients in the CANONIC study by Gustot et al. showed\nthat assessment of CLIF-C ACLF score between days 3\nand 7 and a change in score determined longer-term\noutcome. This supports the idea of repeated assessments\nto define futility in such patients, in whom a fixed time of\nassessment may sometimes be difficult [5].\nConclusions\nPatients with ACLF who require intensive care support￾ive treatment should be assessed early after ITU admis￾sion using the CLIF-C ACLF score. In patients with\nACLF 3 and a CLIF-C ACLF score ≥ 70, who are not\nsuitable for liver transplant, futility of continued cur￾rently available intensive supportive therapy should be\nconsidered. The best treatment options in this scenario\nremain to be determined but may include palliative care.\nAdditional file\nAdditional file 1: Table S1.

The researchers found that liver transplantation reduced the risk of developing liver cancer in PBC patients, with a cumulative incidence rate of 1.3% over a median follow-up period of 5.7 years. The study suggests that liver transplantation should be considered earlier in the course of PBC due to its beneficial effect on reducing the risk of liver cancer. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of early referral and listing for liver transplantation in PBC patients to prevent the development of advanced liver disease and improve outcomes. The study also discusses the limitations of the study, including the relatively small number of PBC patients in the database and the need for longer follow-up periods to confirm the findings. Overall, the results suggest that liver transplantation should be considered as a potential therapeutic option for managing PBC patients at high risk of developing liver cancer. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore the long-term benefits and risks of liver transplantation in PBC patients."}

At the\nbeginning, the LDLT was regarded as an emergency\nprocedure until the availability of liver transplantation\n(LTx) from deceased donors. However, in Japan, the\nnumber of deceased donors is also very small since\nthe Organ Transplantation law was enacted in October\n1997. The LDLT serves as standard medical treatment\nof end-stage liver disease in Japan. Since it is trans￾planted from a living donor, the characteristic advan￾tage to which a liver transplant from a living donor\ngreatly differs from the LTx from deceased donors is\nthat the transplantable liver is of good quality in the\nfirst place. The donor livers can be evaluated, and be\nadequately prepared before transplantation. Further￾more, operations for both the donor and the recipient\ncan be simultaneously performed, therefore, both warm\nand cold ischemic time can be minimized. As a result,\nwell-suited livers are procured. Secondly, it is being\nable to choose the time of the transplant operation.\nSince the donor has determined beforehand, an op￾eration can be on standby-conducted for him in accor￾dance with the state of the recipients. Thirdly, since\nthe donor and recipient are relatives, as one specific\ndonor to one specific recipient, the indications for an\nLTx may be expanded compared to an LTx from a\ndeceased donor. On the other hand, many problems,\nsuch as size mismatching, an ABO-blood type incom￾patible transplantation, the expansion of indication to\nhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a recurrence of post￾operative hepatitis C, and the donor’s safety, are sur￾facing according to the increase in the expansion of\nindication and number of cases after introduction of\nthe LDLT between an adult donor and an adult recipi￾ent. This article describes the present status and fu￾ture perspective of the LDLT.\nREVIEW\nLiving-donor liver transplantation : present status and future\nperspective\nMitsuo Shimada, Masahiko Fujii, Yuji Morine, Satoru Imura, Tetsuya Ikemoto, and\nHiroki Ishibashi\nDepartment of Digestive and Pediatric Surgery, Institute of Health Biosciences, The University of Tokushima\nGraduate School, Tokushima, Japan\nAbstract : About 15 years have passed since the first liver transplant from a living donor (living\ndonor liver transplantation : LDLT), and the status of the procedure has since been established\nas a standard cure for end-stage liver disease in Japan where liver transplantation (LTx) from\ndeceased donors has not yet been accepted. However, the following problems are surfacing\nwith the increase in the number of LDLTs between adults : graft size mismatching, an ABO\nblood-type incompatible transplantation, the expansion of LDLT indication to hepatocellular\ncarcinoma (HCC), the relapse of hepatitis C after LDLT, marginal donors, and the freedom\nfrom immunosuppressive treatment. In this article we outline the present conditions of these\nproblems and the future view of the LDLT. J. Med.

Although the organ transplantation\nspread globally through the improvement of immuno￾suppressants in the 1980s, some patients in Japan went\nover to the West to receive a LTx. Raia1of Brazil en￾forced the first LDLT in 1987(1) as a promising method\nto resolve a chronic organ shortage of potential liver\ntransplants for a child. Since the LTx from deceased\ndonors did not progress in Japan, the first LDLT in\nJapan was enforced by Nagasue and others in a case\ninvolving a boy with biliary atrasia in November 1989\n(2). Makuuchi and others (3) succeeded in the world’s\nfirst LDLT between an adult donor and an adult recipi￾ent in November 1993. Although the Organ Transplan￾tation law was enacted in 1997 and the increase in LTx\nfrom deceased donors was expected, the number of\ncases involving LTx remains at 26 cases and about sev￾eral cases per year till present. Thereafter, the LDLT\nwas the accepted treatment in 2,666 cases in 49 insti￾tutions by the end of 2003 in Japan, although at the\nbeginning the LDLT was regarded as an emergency\nprocedure to establish LTx from deceased donors. The\ndemand for LDLT is further expanded due to the se￾rious shortage of donors. Moreover, the LDLT was\ncovered by medical insurance, and the LDLT has also\nbeen established as a practical solution to address the\norgan-shortage in Japan. The LDLT has been rapidly\ndeveloped also in the West where the shortage of do￾nors is serious. According to the data collected by UNOS\nTable 1.

Thus, judging from\nthe present problem concerning global organ shortage,\nthe use of LDLT is expected to increase from now on.\nAccording to the data of the Japanese Liver Transplan￾tation Society (4), the adult-to-to-adult LDLT is increas￾ing per year, on the other hand, the child cases have\nreached a peak aroud 100 cases per years (Fig. 1). The\n1, 3, and 5-year survival rates of all recipients are 81.8%,\n79.5%, and 77.7%, respectively, while those of child re￾cipients of less than 18 years old in age is 85.6%, 84.1%\nand 82.6%, respectively. In the adult recipients, the 1, 3,\nand 5-year survival rates are 75.6%, 71.7%, and 69.1%,\nand the prognosis of adult recipients is clearly poor\n(Fig. 2). Therefore, various kinds of treatments are\nused to improve the outcome of the adult recipients.\nFigure. 2. The cumulative survival rate in living donor liver transplant in Japan.

Past, present and future of LDLT\n\nPROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED\nThe LDLT is being established as a general medical\ntreatment of various kinds of end-stage liver diseases.\nOn the other hand, it is thought that the original disease\nrecurrence such as hepatitis C and HCC has influenced\na significant decline in the survival rate of adult cases.\nMoreover, the living donor’s mortality and need of LTx\ndue to a postoperative hepatic insufficiency raised a\ncritical social concern in Europe and the United States.\nAlso in Japan, a living donor’s death was reported in\nMay 2003(5). It is necessary to reevaluate the donor’s\nselection standard and safety anew because of the\nexperience of a donor’s morbidity and mortality. The\nfollowing critical problems remain which should be\nurgently solved: 1) graft size mismatching, 2) ABO\nblood-type incompatible transplantation, 3) the expan￾sion of LDLT indication to HCC, 4) the relapse of hepa￾titis C, 5) marginal donors, and 6) the freedom from\nthe immunosuppressants.\n1. Graft size mismatching\nThe minimally required quantity of graft volume has\nnot been fully clarified, which is one of the biggest issues\nof the adult-to-adult LDLT. The following two methods\nexist to express the graft volume : 1) the ratio of graft\nvolume (GV) in the standard liver volume (SLV) of re￾cipient, which is calculated by the recipient’s height\nand body weight, and 2) the ratio of graft weight in the\nrecipient’s weight (GRWR ; graft to recipient weight\nratio). The safe limit of small-for-size graft is reported\nto be set from 30% to 40% in GV/SLV(6, 7), while from\n0.6 to 0.8% in GRWR (8, 9). To increase the graft vol￾ume, a left lobe graft with a caudate lobe is often used\n(10 -12). As an alternative, an APOLT (auxiliary partial\northotopic liver transplantation) was applied in those\nwho deviate from this safe limit of the graft volume\n(13). From the beginning, the APOLT was expected\nto play a role in providing temporary support for trans￾plant patients with fulminant hepatitis while they were\nwaiting for the regeneration of the native liver. However,\nthis was not generalized from the difficult hepatectomy\nof a morbid liver and possible disease transmission\nfrom the preserved native liver to a new liver graft.\nIn order to conquer this problem (small-for-size graft),\nthe right lobe graft which occupies about two thirds\nof the liver has been frequently used. Herein, the patho￾physiology and cause-oriented strategy are described\nabout a small-for-size graft or a large-for-size graft.\na) Small-for-size graft\nThe patient, who received a small-for-size graft, ex￾hibited persistent functional hyperbilirubinemia, in￾tractable ascites, graft dysfunction leading to serious\nconditions such as gastrointestinal bleeding and renal\nfailure. (14-16) The characteristic histological findings\nare as follows: hepatocellular ballooning, fatty degen￾eration, hemorrhagic necrosis, and cholestasis around\nthe central vein so called zone 3. We have advocated\nthe following mechanisms for the small-for-size graft :\n1) superfluous portal blood flow, 2) insufficient hepatic\nvenous drainage, 3) absolute shortage of functional\nliver mass, and 4) inappropriate intragraft responses,\nas shown in Fig.4. Against the superfluous portal flow,\nwhich causes sinusoidal endothelial injury immediately\nafter reperfusion (17, 18), the reduction of portal pressure\nor portal flow by splenectomy, splenic artery ligation\n(19-21), or a porto-systemic shunting (22, 23) was rec￾ommended. To counteract the insufficient hepatic ve￾nous outflow, the venoplasty in a left lobe graft or aggres￾sive reconstruction of the venous tributaries from the\nmiddle hepatic vein is performed to prevent graft con￾gestion, one of the key factors for a successful outcome\n(Fig. 5)(11, 24). The 3-dimensional computed tomogra￾phy(3D-CT) is useful to assess the congestion area\nin the graft prior to operation (Fig. 6). Against the abso￾lute shortage of functional liver mass, a hyperbaric\noxygen treatment or intraportal infusion of drugs (25)\nhas been reported. Recently, as a next-generation strat￾egy, we are developing a bioartificial liver for the\nperiod until the transplanted graft obtains sufficient\nliver volume and function (26, 27). To counteract inap￾propriate responses, the breakdown of liver tissue re￾constitution caused by excessive liver regeneration\nis considered to be the major cause of the rise of portal\npressure, tissue (sinusoidal) congestion, and hepato￾cellular necrosis. Therefore, it is thought that liver re￾generation needs to be adjusted (slowed-down) as a\nnew concept in overcoming a small-for-size-graft. We\nhave also reported the usefulness of geranylgerany￾lacetone (GGA), which successfully induced the heat\nshock protein 70, on the hepatic insufficiency after mas￾sive hepatectomy in rats (28), and such a heat shock\nprotein inducer may become a new treatment strategy\nfor the small-for-size graft.\nb) Large-for-size graft\nWhen a graft size is conversely toolargefora recipient\nsuch as a newborn infant, the graft necrosis occurred\ndue to insufficient blood inflow into the graft. In\nthe case of the large-for-graft over 5% of GRWR, the\ngraft survival was reported to be worsened due to in￾creased incidence of portal vein thrombosis and an\nacute cellular rejection by Kiuchi and others (8). Ka￾The Journal of Medical Investigation Vol. 52 February 2005 ２５\n\nFigure. 4. Pathophysiology of a small-for-size graft\nFigure. 5. Venoplasty and reconstruction of venous tributaries of middle hepatic veins. (Upper column)\nThe multiple hepatic veins in a left lobe graft is made to one lumen (venoplasty).\n(Lower column)\nThe venous tributaries (V5 and V8) were reconstructed using a recipient’s umbilical vein. As a result, the venous wave\nin the ultrasonography maintained well for a long-term period.\n２６ M. Shimada et al. Past, present and future of LDLT\n\nsahara and others (29) reported obtaining good results\nusing a monosegment graft, when GRWR of a graft\nexceeds 4.0%.\n2. ABO blood-type incompatible transplantation\nAn ABO blood-type incompatible LTx is known to\noften need a re-transplant because of the critical com￾plications causing rejection, and, is generally considered\nto be a contraindication except for urgent cases even\nin the LTxfrom deceased donors. However, in the LDLT\ndonor, candidates are restricted to relatives, therefore,\nthe problem of an ABO blood-type incompatible LTx\nis unavoidable. Because of a serious rejection mainly\ncaused by a pre-existing antibody to a donor blood type\nantigen, the hepatic insufficiency due to rapid liver ne￾crosis is often seen by less than 1 month after LDLT,\nand the intractable bile duct damage after 3 months\nis concurred when the graft overcomes hepatic necro￾sis. (30-32) In the case of a baby of less than one year\nof age by whom the immunity function is not estab￾lished, the result equivalent to the blood-type compat￾ible LTx is acquired. On the other hand, in adult cases,\nthe above-mentioned complications significantly reduce\nthe postoperative probability of survival. According\nto Egawa and others (33), the overall 5-year survival\nrate in the ABO blood-type incompatible LDLT was\n59%, and was significantly low compared with blood￾type compatible LDLT. When this was restricted to\nadults of 16 years of age or more, the 5-year survival rate\nwas much poorer (22%). Recently, Tanabe and others\n(34) reported that an intraportal infusion therapy using\ntriple drugs of prostaglandin E1, gabexate mesilate,\nand steroids was useful to prevent serious complications\nin the blood-type incompatible LDLT. A big possibility\nopened up in terms of the improvement in results of\nan blood-type incompatible LTx. After the introduction\nof a portal infusion technique, the overall result in the\nblood-type compatible LDLT improved up to 51.2% of\nthe 5-year survival rate. Furthermore, the Kyoto Uni￾versity group has started a hepatic artery infusion tech￾nique and reported further improvement in results (35).\nThey emphasized the following points regarding the\nmerits of using the hepatic artery : 1) direct effect of\nmedication is expected in a thin artery level, 2) main\nfeeder of bile ducts, 3) improvement of drug-distribution\ndue to imbalanced distribution in portal blood flow.\nImprovement in the results by accumulation of future\ncases is expected.\n3. LDLT for hepatocellular carcinoma\nA liver transplantation is the ultimate treatment in\nwhich not only HCC but the liver cirrhosis of the high\ncancerous state is cured. Until the start of the 1990s,\nthe results of LTx was very poor(36-38), since the LTx\nin the West was also positively enforced in advanced\nHCC. Therefore, HCC has been a contraindication of\nFigure. 6. Three-dimensional computed-tomography (3D-CT) in the graft congenstion. The 3D-CT expressed the con￾gestive area in the liver when significant venous tributaries (V 5 and V 8) are transected. The actual photograph clearly\ndemonstrated the congestive area coincident to the area in 3D-CT.\nThe Journal of Medical Investigation Vol. 52 February 2005 ２７\n\nLTx due to the serious organ shortage late in the 1980s.\nMazzaferro and others (39) reported in 1996 a good\n(acceptable) result of HCC patients (4-year survival\nrate of 75% and 4-year disease free survival rate of 83%),\nwhich is equivalent to the results in other non-HCC\npatients. Their patient’s selection criteria are as follows :\nno extrahepatic metastasis, no macroscopic vascular\ninvasion, single tumor nodule 5 cm or less in diameter\nor tumor nodule 3 or less in number and 3 cm or less\nin diameter. This patient selection criteria is called the\nMilan standard, it is set to a gold standard of the trans￾plant indication for HCC. Recently, UNOS (United Net￾work for Organ Sharing) changed its policy to reduce\nthe number of HCC patients that drop-out from the\nwaiting list due to HCC progression during the waiting\ntime, in which HCC patients are given a higherMELD\n(Model of End-stage Liver Disease) score than other\nliver diseases. As a result, the opportunity for a HCC\npatient to receive an LTx increases (40).\nAlso in Japan, a LDLT is carried out positively on\nHCC patients, and the number of LDLT for HCC was\n225 cases by the end of 2002. Since medical insurance\ncovered the LDLT for cirrhotic patients with HCC, which\nmeets the Milan standard, from January 2004, therefore,\nthe LDLT becomes an important option for HCC treat￾ment. At almost all institutions in Japan, the diameter\nof HCC and the number of HCC nodules are not in￾cluded in the institutional criteria of LDLT to HCC.\nFurthermore, a LDLT may produce the possibility\nof the further expansion of indication to HCC. Because\nthe LDLT can be made on the basis of both recipient’s\nand donor’s sufficient understanding of the validity\nand limit of LDLT, and a fair number of non-recurred\nsurvivors are also proven to exist in the cases of devia￾tion from the Milan standard. Furthermore, the LDLT\nis a special type of transplant, which is performed from\na specific donor to a specific recipient. The UCSF (Uni￾versity of California, San Francisco) standard to which\nthe Milan standard was actually expanded is advocated\nby Yao and others (41) in 2001. Their criteria are as\nfollows : single nodule 6.5 cm or less in diameter, or 3\nor less in number and 4.5 cm or less in diameter (8 cm\nor less in the sum of total maximum diameters of the\nnodules). They reported a good result of probability\nof survival as 90% and 75.2% for one year and five years,\nrespectively, in those who satisfied their criteria.\nWe also reported even those with the Milan stan￾dard deviation can be expected to have a good prog￾nosis if their tumor nodule is 5 cm or less in diameter\nand their des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin value is\nless than 300 mAU/ml (42). It is considered that this\nuseful marker, which serves as an index of the recur￾rence and the expansion of indication to HCC patients,\nis necessary. Furthermore, such apparent risk factors\nfor a recurrence of HCC as 1) the diameter of HCC,\n2) the presence of vascular invasion, and 3) the poorly\ndifferentiated histological type. Therefore, in the near\nfuture, a needle biopsy of HCC should be taken into\nconsideration to clarify the histological type and degree\nof malignancy of HCC using molecular biological tech￾niques in each patient. Regarding the expansion of the\nindication of LDLT to HCC, a new standard based on\nthe above-mentioned facts should be made in the near\nfuture.\n4) Relapse of hepatitis C\nLiver cirrhosis due to hepatitis C is now one of the\nmost frequent indications for LTx, occupying 30-50%\nof all European and American liver transplant patients.\nWhile the relapse of hepatitis B can be completely con￾trolled by lamivudine and the anti-hepatitis B virus im￾munoglobulin (HBIG), the relapse of hepatitis C occurs\nvirologically in about 100% of recipients and histologi￾cally in about 20% of cases to advance to liver cirrhosis\nfive years after LTx (43, 44). Furthermore, some patients\nexhibit a rapid progression to liver cirrhosis as a seri￾ous type of hepatitis called fibrosing cholestatic hepa￾titis, which results in graft loss (45). The risk of graft loss\ndue to a hepatitis C relapse has increased in recent\nyears with an increase in the number of cases, and lead￾ing to a decline in the probability of survival is a big prob￾lem (46). Although an interferon was used as a method\nof preventing hepatitis C recurrence before, and normali￾zation (biochemical effect) of alanine aminotransferase\nvalue is obtained, but the virological effect on hepatitis\nC is seldom seen (47). The anti-virus treatment of a com￾bination of interferon and ribavirin results in a continu￾ous virological response of 40% or more in patients (48,\n49). However, while it is expected as an effective cure,\nthe side effects (hemolytic anemia, etc.) are also strong,\nand there are also many patients dropping-outfrom the\ntreatment regimen. Pegylated-interferon having the\nsame anti-viral effects and few adverse effects, which\nis administered only once a week, is more attractive\nthan conventional interferon, and recently the expectation\nis growing in the combined use of treatment with riv￾abirin. Moreover, a recent report raised the following\nrisk factors for a hepatitis C relapse : short-term use\nof steroids, an elderly donor’s age, the use of azathiopu￾rine, steroids and use of purine-metabolic antagonist\nof mycophenolate mofetil (50).Cyclosporine A, one\nof the calcineurin inhibitors, was recently reported to\nsuppress the viral replication of the hepatitis C virus\n(51). The prevention of hepatitis C is a growing issue\n２８ M. Shimada et al. Past, present and future of LDLT\n\nin LDLT.\n5) Marginal donors\nIn order to improve the results in adult-to-adult LDLT,\na right lobe graft, approximately two thirds of the liver,\nwas introduced and is now frequently used, instead\nof a left lobe graft or a left lateral segment graft in chi\nrecipients. Recently, a mortality of the living donor was\nreported in the West (52-55). Furthermore, in Japan,\nin proportion to an increase of a right lobe graft, donor’s\ncomplications have increased due to the small residual\nliver volume in donors. A donor’s death was finally re￾ported in Japan May 2003(5). Now, the donor’s safety\nis again a top priority. From the viewpoint of both the\ndonor’s safety and the recipient’s outcome, the interests\nin marginal donors are rapidly increasing. The selection\nstandard and evaluation basis of marginal donors are\nherein discussed.\na) Fatty liver\nA fatty liver is known to be unsuitable as a transplant\ngraft, which has been pointed out from experiences\nof LTxfrom deceased donors. During a cold preservation\nof the fatty liver graft, the fusion and expansion of fats\nis made to press sinusoids and hepatocytes, leading\nto the circulation disturbance in the sinusoids ad graft\ninjury (56). Since such a cold preservation period can\nbe minimized in a LDLT, the graft with a certain degree\nof fatty infiltration is usable. However, there are little\nclear parameters to demonstrate the limits of the fatty\nliver. We previously reported that in the LDLT the fatty\nliver was acceptable to the moderate grade of macrove￾sicular steatosis (20 to 50% of macrovesicular steatosis)\n(57). However, our recent research showed that the\nbreakdown of sinusoidal reconstitution occurs in the\nliver regeneration process of a fatty liver(58), therefore,\nthe fatty liver donor should be avoided in the case of\nthe small-for-size graft. In such a case, since a LDLT\nis a scheduled operation, diet control and/or daily ex￾ercise are recommended before an operation to improve\nthe degree of fatty liver. Moreover, NASH (non-alcoholic\nsteatohepatitis) has attracted attention because of the\nfirst donor’s death in Japan in 2003. Especially, in the\ncase of metabolic syndrome exhibiting the following\nsymptoms and signs of high blood pressure, hyper￾lipidemia, diabetes, and obesity, the NASH should be\nruled out using an ultrasonography and abdominal CT,\nfurthermore and sometimes liver biopsy.\nb) Age\nThere are many institutions, which specify the maxi￾mum living-donor’s age to be 65 years old for the LDLT.\nAn advanced age donor’s problem in LDLT is firstly\nthe increase in a risk of hepatectomy. Due to improve￾ments in surgical techniques and the perioperative man￾agement, the rate of postoperative complications is low\n(nearly zero) compared with overseas. However, since\nthe donor’s hepatectomy is an operation conducted\non a healthy donor, in order to avoid postoperative\ncomplications, an evaluation of the whole body state\n(operability) or estimation of residual liver volume be￾fore an operation takes precedence. Secondly, it is an\nincrease in the risk to the recipient due to a reduced\nfunctional reserve of the transplant graft based on an\nadvanced age. It is thought that elderly people’s liver\nfunction is greatly influenced by the ischemia and reper￾fusion injury compared to young livers, although it\nseems practically equal compared with a young liver.\nFor this reason, when a transplant graft is small-for￾size, an aged liver graft should be avoided. Technetium￾99m-galactosyl-human serum albumin (GSA) scintig￾raphy, which expresses the binding ability of asialo￾glycoprotein of the liver, was suggested to be useful\nin the evaluation of potential graft quality in LDLT(59).\n6) Freedom from immunosuppressants\nThe immunosuppression after a liver transplantation\nis in principle based on the combination of a calcineurin\ninhibitor such as cyclosporine A and taclorimus, and\nsteroids. Recent trends in immunosuppression after\nLTx is an early cessation of steroids and dose-reduction\nof calcinneurin inhibitors to decrease the incidence\nof adverse effects. A big theme in immunosuppression\nafter LDLT is the complete freedom from the immuno￾suppression. The Kyoto University group advocated\nthe following conditions to reduce or stop immuno￾suppression : 1) 2 years or more passed after LDLT;\n2) normal liver function, 3) no history of acute cellular\nrejection within one year ; and 4) no evidence of pro￾gressive bile duct damage in a liver biopsy specimen.\nThey succeeded in creating operational immune tol￾erance in 35 children out of 67(10th ILTS). A future aim\nis an operational immune tolerance in adult recipients.\nIN CONCLUSION\nIn this article we outlined the historical background\nof a LDLT, and its present status andfuture perspective.\nIn the present time, beyond all doubt, a LDLT is an\nimportant treatment option for end-stage liver diseases\nin Japan, where a LTx form deceased donors has not\nbeen yet accepted. However, the LDLT is a medical\ntreatment with a relatively short history, and there are\nThe Journal of Medical Investigation Vol. 52 February 2005 ２９\n\nalso many problems to be solved. Now in Japan, viral\nliver cirrhosis and HCC within the Milan criteria has\nbeen covered by medical insurance from January 2004.\nThe number of LDLT is expected to increase from now\non. Under these circumstances, although an improve￾ment in the results of LDLT is the aim, the donor’s safety\nmust be a priority. Obviously critical complications and\naccidental death must be avoided by only operating\non healthy patients. Anyway, from now on it is expected\nthat there will be an increase in the number of LTx from\ndeceased donors which currently amounts to about\nseveral cases per year.\nREFERENCES\n1.

This trend has been attributed to the introduction of curative directing acting\nantiviral treatment for hepatitis C, alcohol abuse, and the rising obesity epidemic in the coun￾try [6]. However, a complete analysis of all causes of liver disease and HCC among adult liver\ntransplant recipients in the U.S. has not been reported. In 2020, the Organ Procurement and\nTransplant Network (OPTN) reported that the major indication for liver transplants in 2018\nwas for other/unknown causes [7], accounting for 33.9% of liver transplants. Although unsub￾stantiated, this has led to speculation that many in the other/unknown category represent\npatients with NAFLD [8]. Liver transplants for HCC were also frequently reported as a sepa￾rate category and not under the liver disease causing HCC. This leads to an undercount of the\nactual burden of the underlying etiology of liver disease treated by liver transplantation. The\npurpose of this study is to conduct an in-depth analysis of all causes of liver disease and their\nassociated complications including HCC among liver transplants recipients from 2010 to\n2019.\nMaterials and methods\nThe data for this analysis was obtained from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Net￾work (OPTN) STAR database, a national database operated by the United Network of Organ\nSharing (UNOS) under contract with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that\ncontains all the data in the U.S. on organ transplantation including waiting list, organ dona￾tion, and transplantation. All the data contained in the OPTN database are fully anonymized\nand the authors had no access to any identifying information. The study cohort included all\nthe adult patients aged 18 years and older (66,719) who received liver transplants between Jan￾uary 1, 2010 and December 31, 2019. The causes of liver disease (S1 Table) were categorized by\ncombining the diagnoses entered into the database as primary and secondary diagnoses at ini￾tial waitlist registration, final diagnosis entered at time of transplant, and positive serology for\nhepatitis B (hepatitis B surface antigen, HBsAg) and hepatitis C (hepatitis C antibody). When\nthere was more than one diagnosis, the cause of liver disease was categorized by prioritizing\nthe final diagnosis at time of transplant, then primary diagnosis at time of waitlist registration,\nthen secondary diagnosis at time of waitlist registration. The cause of liver disease was catego￾rized under HCV and hepatitis B if the patients were hepatitis C antibody positive and hepati￾tis B surface antigen positive, respectively. The etiology of HCC was based on the liver diseases\nlisted as primary or secondary diagnoses at waitlist, final diagnosis at time of transplant, and\nserology for hepatitis B and C. HCC and cryptogenic cirrhosis were only listed as separate cate￾gories when there was no known associated liver disease. Recipients who had no diagnosis\ninformation in the database were grouped under a category named ‘unspecified cause’.\nPLOS ONE\nCauses and trends in liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239393 September 18, 2020 2 / 14\nFunding: All the funding and support for this study\nis provided by the Asian Liver Center, Department\nof Surgery, Stanford University School of Medicine.\nThere was no additional external funding received\nfor this study.\nCompeting interests: The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist\nAbbreviations: ALD, alcohol associated liver\ndisease (non-HCV related); BMI, body mass index;\nHBV, hepatitis B; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma;\nHCV, hepatitis C; LT, liver transplant; NAFLD, non￾alcoholic fatty liver disease; OPTN, Organ\nProcurement and Transplant Network.\n\nRecipients were analyzed by gender to assess trends in liver transplants and whether there\nwere different disease burdens resulting in liver transplantation between men and women, and\nBMI at time of waitlist registration to assess the potential effect of the obesity epidemic.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using SAS v9.4 software. Differences between the propor￾tions of liver transplant performed each year for the various causes of liver disease compared\nwith 2010 were calculated using a Z-test for two proportions. P-values and related confidence\nintervals (CIs) were reported accordingly. Linear regression analysis was conducted in SAS for\ntrend over ten years, and the p-values and parameter estimates were reported accordingly.\nResults\nTrends in etiology of liver disease and HCC among adult liver transplant\nrecipients from 2010 to 2019\nThe number of adult liver transplants per year has steadily increased from 5,731 in 2010 to\n8,345 in 2019 (45.6% increase). Between 2010 and 2019, proportion of liver transplant recipi￾ents with BMI � 30 has increased from 37.0% to 40.8% [3.8%, (95% CI 2.2% to 5.4%),\np<0.001], and proportion of recipients with BMI � 35 has increased from 13.8% to 16.7%\n[2.9%, (95% CI 1.7% to 4.1%), p<0.001] (Table 1).\nAmong adults who received liver transplants in 2019, the number and proportion of liver\ntransplants by etiology of liver disease and HCC in descending order of frequency were alco￾hol-associated liver disease (2,399 or 28.8%), NAFLD (1,795 or 21.5%), HCV (1,563 or 18.7%),\ncholestatic liver disease (641 or 7.7%), hepatitis B with or without hepatitis C or hepatitis D\ncoinfection (355 or 4.3%), cryptogenic cirrhosis (259 or 3.1%), autoimmune liver disease (234\nor 2.8%), metabolic liver disease (243 or 2.9%), acute hepatic necrosis unrelated to hepatitis B\nor hepatitis C (169 or 2.1%), unspecified causes of HCC (132 or 1.6%), graft failure (142 or\n1.7%), benign hepatic tumors (103 or 1.2%), non-HCC malignant liver tumors (93 or 1.1%),\nBudd-Chiari syndrome (30 or 0.4%), miscellaneous causes (32 or 0.4%), and unspecified\ncauses (145 or 1.7%) (Table 1).\nThe proportion of liver transplants for hepatitis C has declined significantly. Although hep￾atitis C associated liver disease and HCC was the leading cause of liver transplants from 2010\nto 2017, it dropped to number two behind alcohol associated liver disease in 2018 and to num￾ber three behind NAFLD among the most common causes of liver transplants in 2019.\nBetween 2010 and 2019, the proportion of liver transplants for hepatitis C associated liver dis￾ease and HCC declined by more than half from 44.5% to 18.7% [25.8%, (95% CI 24.3% to\n27.3%), p<0.001].\nDuring the same period, the proportions of liver transplants for liver disease and HCC\nrelated to ALD and NAFLD have doubled from 12.7% to 28.8% [16.1%, (95% CI 14.8% to\n17.4%), p<0.001], and from 9.1% to 21.5% [12.4%, (95% CI 11.2% to 13.5%), p<0.001],\nrespectively. Proportion of liver transplants for graft failure and benign hepatic tumors have\nalso increased from 0.2% to 1.7% [1.5%, (95% CI 1.2% to 1.8%), p<0.001] and from 0.7% to\n1.2% [0.5%, (95% CI 0.2% to 0.8%), p = 0.003] respectively (Table 1).\nBetween 2010 and 2019, the proportions of liver transplants for hepatitis B associated liver\ndisease and HCC decreased from 5.7% to 4.3% [1.4%, (95% CI 0.7% to 2.2%), p<0.001], cryp￾togenic cirrhosis from 4.7% to 3.1% [1.6%, (95% CI 0.9% to 2.3%), p<0.001], acute hepatic\nnecrosis unrelated to hepatitis B or C from 3.1% to 2.1% [1.0%, (95% CI 0.5% to 1.6%),\np<0.001], and unspecified causes of liver disease or cirrhosis from 3% to 1.7% [1.3%, (95% CI\nPLOS ONE\nCauses and trends in liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239393 September 18, 2020 3 / 14\n\n0.8% to 1.8%), p<0.001]. There were no changes in the proportion of liver transplants for liver\ndisease and HCC associated with cholestatic liver disease, autoimmune liver disease, metabolic\nliver disease, unspecified causes of HCC, other malignant liver tumors, Budd-Chiari syn￾drome, and miscellaneous causes from 2010 to 2019 (Table 1).\nIn a linear regression analysis, the major changes in the trend in the causes of liver disease\nand HCC among adult transplant recipients between 2010 and 2019 were proportions of liver\ntransplants for HCV (-2.98 [95% CI -3.85 to -2.11]), ALD (1.81 [95% CI 1.35 to 2.27]), and\nNAFLD (1.49 [95% CI 1.28 to 1.70]) (Table 2).

In 2017 NAFLD surpassed\nhepatitis C as the leading cause of liver disease in women receiving liver transplants, and in\n2019 alcohol-associated liver disease surpassed HCV to become the second major cause of\nliver transplants in women. Among women who received liver transplants in 2019, the five\nleading causes of liver disease in decreasing order of frequency were liver disease and HCC\nassociated with NAFLD, alcohol associated liver disease, hepatitis C, cholestatic liver disease,\nand autoimmune liver disease (Table 4).\nEtiology of HCC among adult liver transplant recipients between 2010 and\n2019\nFrom January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019, 19,872 (31%) adult liver transplant recipients\nwere diagnosed with HCC (S3 Table).

Between 2010 and 2019, there were no significant changes in\nthe proportion of liver transplants for HCC related to cholestatic liver disease (1.9%), crypto￾genic cirrhosis (2.0%), autoimmune cirrhosis (1.0%), metabolic disease (1.0%), and Budd￾Chiari (0.2%) (Table 5).\nWhen analyzed by gender, hepatitis C remained the leading cause of HCC in both men and\nwomen who received liver transplants although it has dropped from 68.3% to 46.0% [22.3%,\n(95% CI 18.7% to 25.9%), p<0.001] in men and from 66.4% to 36.7% [29.7%, (95% CI 23.2%\nto 35.9%), p<0.001] in women between 2010 and 2019. In 2019, the second most common\ncause of HCC was ALD in men (19%), but in women it was NAFLD (30%). In women, ALD\nwas not a common cause of HCC accounting for only 7.0% of liver transplants for HCC in\n2019 (Table 5).\nPLOS ONE\nCauses and trends in liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239393 September 18, 2020 7 / 14\n\nDiscussion\nThe major indication for liver transplantation in 2018 was listed as other/unknown causes\n(33.9%) in the 2020 Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) Report [7]. But in\nthis study, when all causes of liver disease and HCC were examined by compiling all the diag￾nosis and HBV and HCV serologic data entries in the OPTN STAR database from time of ini￾tial waitlist registration to time of transplantation, we found only a very small proportion\n(1.7%) of liver transplant in adults had unknown causes of liver disease in 2018 and 2019.\nOur study found that although hepatitis C related liver disease and HCC was the leading\ncause for liver transplants in the U.S. and accounted for half of liver transplants in men and a\nthird of the liver transplants in women between 2010 to 2014, there has been a dramatic and\nsustained decline since then.

The decline was even greater for hep￾atitis C without associated HCC (S4 Table). The declining numbers and proportions of liver\ntransplants for liver disease and HCC associated with hepatitis C is in concordance with the\nreports of a similar decrease in proportion of patients with hepatitis C enrolled on the liver\ntransplant waitlist [5]. This decline in liver transplant for hepatitis C complication is contem￾poraneously associated with increased screening and the introduction of the highly effective,\ncurative direct acting antiviral therapies for hepatitis C [6]. There was also a decrease in the\nproportion of liver transplants for liver disease and HCC related to hepatitis B between 2010\nand 2019. This may, likewise, be attributed to antiviral therapy and screening programs for\nchronic hepatitis B.\nWith the decline in liver transplants for HCV, the proportion of liver transplants for liver\ndisease and HCC associated with NAFLD has more than doubled from 7.6% to 18.5% in men,\nand from 11.9% to 26.8% in women between 2010 and 2019. In 2017, NAFLD surpassed hepa￾titis C as the leading etiology of liver disease among women who received liver transplants and\nremained the third most common etiology of liver disease among men who received liver\ntransplants. The increase in liver transplant for NAFLD is associated with a growing obesity\ncrisis [6]. Between 2010 and 2019, proportion of male transplant recipients who were severely\nobese (BMI � 35) increased from 12.4% to 15.7%, and from 16.5% to 18.4% in women. Past\nstudies have suggested that many transplant recipients with cryptogenic cirrhosis may repre￾sent uncounted cases of NAFLD [9, 10] and should be included as a part of the NAFLD cohort.\nWe found among the 259 (3.1% of total) transplants for cryptogenic cirrhosis in 2019, only 32\n(12.4%) recipients had a BMI � 35, and among the 145 (1.7% of total) transplants with unspec￾ified liver disease, only 6 (4.1%) had a BMI � 35. Therefore, they would be unlikely contribute\nto a significant increase in cases of NAFLD. Liver transplants for liver disease and HCC associ￾ated with NAFLD will likely continue to grow as a result of the high prevalence of severe and\nmorbid obesity in the U.S. population.

ALD\nhas become the leading indication for liver transplants in men and the second major indica￾tion for liver transplants in women in 2019. This trend is associated with the rising alcohol use\nin the U.S. population [12, 13]. Although men are traditionally heavier drinkers than women,\nalcohol consumption is rising in women as well. The National Epidemiologic Survey on Alco￾hol and Related Conditions reported increases in alcohol use especially among women in addi￾tion to older adults and racial/ethnic minorities [14, 15]. The increase in liver transplants for\nALD has also been attributed to broader acceptance of alcoholic liver disease for liver trans￾plants and the relaxation of the mandatory six-month abstinence period prior to transplanta￾tion by many transplant centers across the country [16]. Although our study included\ntransplant recipients with HCC or cirrhosis (without HCC) under the same underlying etiol￾ogy (Tables 1–3), a similar trend in liver transplants for HCV, ALD and NAFLD was found in\nboth recipients without HCC and recipients with HCC (S4 Table).\nHCC is a common indication for liver transplantation, although it has declined from 33%\nto 29% of the transplants in men, and from 20% to 15% among women who received liver\ntransplants between 2010 and 2019. Hepatitis C was the most common cause of HCC among\nliver transplant recipients, but it has decreased from 68.3% to 46.0% in men and from 66.4% to\n36.7% in women between 2010 and 2019. The proportion of liver transplants for HCC caused\nby ALD has increased by 130% in men (from 8.2% to 18.5%) between 2010 and 2019, although\nit remained a less common cause of HCC in women. Proportion of liver transplants for HCC\ncaused by NAFLD showed the greatest increase from 4.4% to 15.4% in men and from 6.9% to\n29.7% in women between 2010 and 2019. Our findings are consistent with a recent study that\nin the first quarter of 2019, NASH has surpassed HCV (including HCV+ALD) among women\nwith HCC on the liver transplant waitlist, but HCV remained the major etiology among men\nwith HCC on the liver transplant waitlist in 2019 [5]. Hepatitis B was the second most com￾mon cause of HCC in men and women in 2010, but has since dropped to fourth in men and\nthird in women.\nBetween 2010 and 2019, there was a decrease in the proportions of liver transplants for\nacute hepatic necrosis (unrelated to hepatitis B or C), cryptogenic cirrhosis and in the category\nof unspecified diagnosis. Although the reason for the decrease in acute hepatic necrosis is\nunclear, the latter two decreasing trends likely reflect better diagnosis and coding entries into\nthe UNOS database. There were also increases in liver transplants for graft failure and benign\nhepatic tumors that were not been previously reported. In the past 10 years, there were no sig￾nificant changes in the proportions of liver transplants for cholestatic liver disease, autoim￾mune liver disease, metabolic liver disease, unspecified causes of HCC, other malignant\ntumors, Budd-Chiari, and in the several diseases we placed in the miscellaneous category.\nFrom 2010 to 2019, about 75% of liver transplants in adults and 87% of liver transplants for\nHCC each year were performed for complications of largely preventable or treatable causes\n(hepatitis C and hepatitis B, alcohol associated liver disease, and NAFLD). A public health\nresponse to improve awareness, prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment is much needed to\nhelp to reduce and eliminate the burden of liver disease and HCC caused by these four dis￾eases. Hepatitis C is an example of what can be achieved through a national public health cam￾paign. Once the most common indication accounting for almost half of liver transplants each\nyear, the continued decline in the number and proportion of men and women transplanted or\non the transplant waitlist for hepatitis C demonstrates that with a national campaign to\nPLOS ONE\nCauses and trends in liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239393 September 18, 2020 10 / 14\n\nincrease hepatitis C screening and treatment, it is feasible to eliminate or reduce its complica￾tions and the need for transplantation. Continued declines in liver transplants for HCC related\ncomplications can occur by implementing the 2020 US Preventive Services Task Force\n(USPSTP) recommendations for universal screening, preventing new infections through harm\nreduction and needle exchange, and widening access to direct acting antiviral treatment by\neliminating fibrosis restrictions [17–20]. Although a decrease in transplants for hepatitis B was\nseen, there was no change in transplants for HCC associated with hepatitis B. The risks of hep￾atitis B progression to HCC and cirrhosis can likewise be combated through hepatitis B immu￾nization, public health campaigns to increase screening of at-risk populations including high\nprevalence foreign-born persons (according to USPSTF recommendations), and long-term\ndisease monitoring and antiviral treatment [21–23]. The rising trend in liver transplants for\nNAFLD and alcohol-associated liver disease is concerning. Since there is no targeted pharma￾cological treatment for NAFLD [24], public health campaigns to promote healthy eating and\nexercise beginning from early childhood, and increased participation of healthcare providers\nin obesity screening and behavioral counselling are necessary to decrease risk of NAFLD com￾plications [25–27]. Likewise, interventions to reduce alcohol consumption including aware￾ness campaigns and regulation of advertising and pricing, alcohol misuse screenings, and\nclinical interventions [28] are needed to reduce the future burden of end stage liver disease\nand HCC caused by alcohol associated liver disease.\nStrength and limitations\nWhile prior studies frequently reported HCC as a separate category and not under the liver dis￾ease that caused HCC or have focused on hepatitis C, NAFLD or ALD among patients on the\nwaitlist for liver transplant, this is the only study that analyzed all causes of liver disease and\nHCC among adults who received liver transplants. The limitations of our study include that we\nrestricted our analysis to transplant recipients, so our study does not reflect overall numbers\nand prevalence of these liver conditions among patients on the transplant waiting list. In addi￾tion, while we tried our best to categorize patients into disease categories, a small number of\npatients where multiple conditions were present, we included them only under their primary\ndiagnosis. We are further limited by the accuracy of data entry and availability of information\nrecorded in the database–for instance we lacked information on metabolic syndrome and risk\nfactors of NAFLD. Despite these limitations, our study provides the first complete analysis of all\ncauses of liver disease among liver transplant recipients between 2010 and 2019.\nConclusions\nWhen all causes of liver disease and HCC were examined, the proportion of liver transplants\nfor unspecified indications in 2019 was only 1.7%. About 75% of liver transplants in adults and\n87% of liver transplants for HCC each year were performed for complications of largely pre￾ventable or treatable diseases (hepatitis C and B, alcohol associated liver disease and NAFLD),\nunderlying the importance of public health interventions in raising awareness, prevention,\nearly diagnosis and treatment to prevent disease progression to end stage liver disease and\nHCC. The decline in liver transplantation for HCV demonstrates the feasibility to reduce the\nburden of end stage liver disease caused by hepatitis C through an increase in screening and\ntreatment efforts.\nSupporting information\nS1 Table.

It focuses on the etiologies of liver disease leading to transplantation, including viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). The study finds that the number of liver transplants due to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has decreased dramatically, while those due to alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and NASH have increased significantly. The study also notes that the majority of ALD and NASH cases involve individuals with obesity or overweight status. Additionally, the study highlights the need for strategies to prevent and manage obesity and alcohol-related liver disease from a public health perspective. Overall, the study suggests that the changing patterns of liver disease require ongoing monitoring and adaptation of clinical practices and policies related to liver transplantation."}

OLT in\nrats was pioneered by Lee et al. in 1973 using hand-suture techniques of all vessels. This\nmodel has not been widely used due to the long operative time and technical demand. The\ncuff method was introduced by Kamada in 1979, and today, the Kamada technique is the one\nmost commonly used worldwide. However, this technique does not include hepatic artery\nreconstruction, although this procedure is routinely performed in clinical transplantation.\nNevertheless, several techniques for hepatic artery reconstruction in rat OLT have been\nreported recently, and our group also developed a simple splint technique from recipient right\nrenal artery to donor celiac axis bearing the hepatic artery. In the present article, we describe\nthe Kamada technique, as a standard surgical method for rat OLT. In addition, we also\ndescribe our splint technique for hepatic artery reconstruction. Then, we compare the features\nof Kamada technique and our splint technique for hepatic artery reconstruction and all other\nsurgical techniques currently in use for rat OLT. The widespread use of the rat OLT model\nshould help to provide full assessment of transplant immunology and the mechanism and\ntreatment of inflammatory liver diseases.\n(J Nippon Med Sch 2013; 80: 4―15)\nKey words: animal model, liver transplantation, hepatic artery, rat, rearterialization\nIntroduction\nLiver transplantation is the replacement of a\ndiseased liver with a healthy liver graft. About 50\nyears have passed since the first clinical liver\ntransplantation by a surgical team led by Starzl in\nthe United States1,2. One year after the first liver\ntransplantation, clinical liver transplantation was\nstarted in Japan3\n. Liver transplantation from a non￾Correspondence to Akira Shimizu, MD, PhD, Department of Analytic Human Pathology, Nippon Medical School,\n1-1-5 Sendagi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113―8602, Japan\nE-mail: ashimizu@nms.ac.jp\nJournal Website (http:www.nms.ac.jpjnms)\n\nThe Surgical Technique of Rat OLT\nJ Nippon Med Sch 2013; 80 (1) 5\nheart-beating donor was first performed in 1964 by\nNakayama from Chiba University. The first living\ndonor liver transplantation in Japan was performed\nin November 1989 by Nagasue of Shimane\nUniversity for a boy with biliary atresia4\n. Makuuchi\nof Shinshu University succeeded in performing the\nworldʼs first living donor liver transplantation\nbetween an adult donor and an adult recipient in\nNovember 19935\n. After the Japanese government\nenacted the Organ Transplantation Law in 1997,\nKawasaki of Shinshu University performed the first\ncase of liver transplantation from a brain-dead\ncadaveric donor in Japan in 19996\n. At Nippon\nMedical School Hospital, clinical liver transplantation\nhas also been performed by Department of Surgery\nsince 20007\n. Thanks to advances in surgical\ntechniques and the development of new\nimmunosuppressants, liver transplantation has\nbecome an important treatment for hepatic failure.\nThe advances in liver transplantation are due, in\npart, to research in small and large experimental\nanimals. Experimental liver transplantation was first\nattempted about 60 years, at almost the similar\nperiod as the start of clinical liver transplantation in\nthe United States2,8,9. Since then, new animal models\nhave been developed, surgical techniques have been\ncontinuously refined, and experimental liver\ntransplantation is now a versatile research tool that\nhas been used to clarify various issues related to\nhuman clinical liver transplantation10,11. In particular,\nthe rat has become a suitable model for studying the\nmechanisms of graft rejection, graft tolerance, and\npreservation-induced injury in liver\ntransplantation12―14, based on its technical feasibility,\nthe availability of inbred strains with well￾established major histocompatibility complex, low\ncosts, and simple handling. Now, the rat model of\nliver transplantation has been modified to serve as a\nmodel for clinical living donor liver transplantation\nusing partial liver grafts, auxiliary heterotopic liver\ntransplantation, retransplantation using the same\nliver graft, and xenogeneic liver transplantation15―19.\nRat Orthotopic Liver Transplantation (OLT)\nModel\nThe orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT)\ntechnique in the rat was first described by Lee20,21\nand was further enhanced by Kamada by the\nintroduction of the cuff technique22. Ishii E. worked\nwith Dr. Kamada at the National Childrenʼs Medical\nResearch Center, Tokyo, Japan23, and learned his\ntechnique directly from him. The Kamada technique\nof rat OLT appears to be well standardized and has\nbecome popular, and the model has been used\nworldwide. The rat OLT model is useful for analysis\nof clinical liver transplantation. In addition, we\nconsider this model to be important for assessing\ninflammatory liver diseases. In the present article,\nwe describe the Kamada technique of rat OLT, as a\nstandard surgical technique. Although controversy\nexists regarding the importance of hepatic artery\n(HA) reconstruction in rat OLT experiment, we\ndescribe our recently developed splint technique for\nHA reconstruction in rat OLT.\nKamadaʼs Technique for Rat OLT\nIn rat OLT, at least 4 anastomoses should be\nperformed for donorʼs and recipientʼs veins, such as\nsuprahepatic inferior vena cava ( SHIVC ) ,\ninfrahepatic inferior vena cava (IHIVC), and portal\nvein (PV), and the bile duct (BD). In Kamadaʼs\ntechnique, the cuff method is used to reconstruct the\nPV and IHIVC22. The anastomosis of the SHIVC is\nperformed with the suture technique, and the\ntelescope method is used to reconstruct the BD.\nAnimals, Chemical Agents,\nand Surgical Instruments\nRats 10 to 14 weeks old and weighing 200 to 250 g\nat the time of surgery were used as both donors and\nrecipients. The rats were housed in Plexiglas cages\nin a temperature- and humidity-controlled\nenvironment and allowed free access to water and\nnormal rat chow. The Animal Studies Committee of\nour institution approved all experimental protocols\n\nE.

The \nsuprahepatic inferior vena cava (SHIVC), portal vein (PV), and infrahepatic inferior vena \ncava (IHIVC) are divided after heparin injection and perfusion of the liver graft using \nphysiologic saline solution. The liver graft is placed in a 4℃ saline bath.

A 6-0 silk thread\nwas used for cuff preparation, 6-0 proline and 7-0\nproline sutures (Ethicon, Inc., Somerville, NJ, USA)\nwere used for anastomosis of the SHIVC, and 3-0\nnylon suture on a needle was used for abdominal\nwall closure. The cuff was made from a 14-G\nperipheral catheter (14-G Surflo, Terumo Corp.,\nTokyo) for anastomosis of the PV and the IHIVC.\nThe splint tube for anastomosis of the HA and\ntelescope tubes for anastomosis of the BD were\nprepared from 22-G peripheral catheter (22-G Surflo,\nTerumo).\nRat OLT\nRat OLT was performed with the technique of\nKamada22, and the HA reconstruction was performed\nwith our splint technique.\nDonor Surgery (Fig. 1)\nA transverse abdominal incision is performed\nunder ether anesthesia. The gastrointestinal tract is\nexteriorized to the left and covered with wet gauze.\nThe PV is divided from the right gastric and splenic\nveins. The IHIVC is divided from the adrenal vein\nand the lumbar vein. The right renal vein is ligated\nand isolated from the IHIVC. The donor BD is\ntransected, and a 0.3-cm-long tube (22-G Surflo) is\ninserted into the lumen of the BD and\ncircumferentially secured with 6-0 silk suture. Then\nthe gastroduodenal artery, the left gastric artery,\nand the splenic artery are ligated and divided.\nHeparin (50 U) is injected intravenously. The celiac\naxis and the aortic segment are divided. The IHIVC\nand PV are clamped.

The cuff extension is held\nwith forceps, and another forceps is passed through\nthe lumen of the cuff tube to grasp the PV. The cuff\nis then slipped over the PV. The cuff extension,\nincluding the PV, is secured with a bulldog clamp,\nwhich is fixed to the wall of the bath container. At\nthis point, the open end of the PV is spread with 2\nforceps. The end of the PV is then everted over the\ncuff body and secured in this position with a\ncircumferential 6-0 silk suture. The same method is\nused for the IHIVC. To prepare the SHIVC, the\ndiaphragm and connective tissues are completely\nremoved. Stay sutures are then made with 6-0\nproline on both edges of the SHIVC.\nRecipient Surgery\nA midline abdominal incision is made under ether\nanesthesia. The gastrointestinal tract is covered with\nwet gauze and kept within the abdominal cavity.\nThe right adrenal and left phrenic veins are ligated\nand divided. The right renal artery is transected,\nand a 0.3-cm-long tube (22-G Surflo) is inserted into\nthe arterial lumen and circumferentially secured\nwith 6-0 silk suture.

The cuff extension\nof the donor PV is held with a right-angle forceps.\nThe cuffed donor PV is inserted into the recipient\nPV. The anastomosis is completed with a\ncircumferential 6-0 silk suture. The clamps on the\nPV are released, and the anhepatic time is\napproximately 15 minutes. Next, the IHIVC\nanastomosis is performed with the same method\nused for PV anastomosis. The cuffed donor IHIVC is\ninserted into the recipient IHIVC, and the\nanastomosis is completed with a circumferential 6-0\nsilk suture. The BD anastomosis is performed with\nthe telescope technique between the tube secured in\nthe donor BD and the tube secured in the recipient\nBD. The anastomosis is secured by tying together\nthe ligatures on the donor and recipient BDs (Fig. 4).\nThe abdominal incision is closed with a continuous\n3-0 nylon suture. The PV clamping time is about 15\nminutes, and the IHIVC clamping time is 20 to 25\nminutes.

The splint\ntube secured in the recipient right renal artery is\ninserted in the donor celiac axis bearing the HA and\nsecured with 6-0 silk suture. In procedures for HA\nre-arterialization, the connection between the\nrecipient right renal artery with splint tube and the\ndonor celiac artery is completed within 1 minute. In\nsyngeneic OLT between Lewis rats, the patency of\nthe splint anastomosis is confirmed with\nangiography of the grafted liver through the\nrecipient aorta more than 120 days after surgery\n(Fig. 6).\nOther Surgical Technique of Rat OLT\nIn rat OLT, several techniques or modifications\nhave been described to improve and facilitate the\ncomplex procedures 20 ― 22,24 ― 48.

Although the microsuture\ntechnique provides conditions most similar to\nphysiological conditions for the clinically\ntransplanted liver and, thus, is associated with fewer\ncomplications, such as thrombosis49, it requires a high\nlevel of microsurgical skill. In addition, the anhepatic\ntime is longer in the microsuture technique than\nwith the cuff procedure26,31. On the other hand, the\ncomplications reported with the cuff technique are\nblood flow disturbances, with subsequent\nthrombosis, and foreign body reaction to the cuff36,49.\nHowever, Kamada et al., who performed rat OLT\n530 times over a 5-year period, reported a 95.3%\nsurvival rate of recipient rats50. In our experience,\nthe long-term (>1 year) survival rate of the liver\ngraft is 100% in Kamada technique-rat OLT for the\nsyngeneic donor and recipient combination.\nFurthermore, the cuff technique, which reduces the\nanhepatic time (to less than 15 minutes) is favored\nfor livers with a long preservation time26,31,47. A short\nduration of the anhepatic phase translates into\nsuccessful OLT. The PV clamping time should not\nexceed 25 minutes, and IHIVC clamping time should\nnot exceed 30 to 35 minutes. These time intervals\nare the thresholds for splanchnic and systemic\nvenous cross clamping, beyond which cardiovascular\ndepression and acid-base imbalances may ensue28,49.\nSeveral modified methods are also introduced for the\nreconstruction of SHIVC, IHIVC, and PV. To shorten\nthe ischemic time, the temporary splint method is\nused for the anastomosis of the PV and IHIVC\nbefore the running suture technique (microsuture￾temporary splint method)28. The splint method is also\nused to reconstruct the SHIVC30. In addition, for the\nquick and easy connection of hepatic veins (PV,\nIHIVC, and SHIVC), the special Quick-linker kit is\nused for their reconstruction31. The methods used for\nBD reconstruction include pull-through, telescopic,\n\nE.

For BD\nreconstruction, Teflon splints are commonly used,\nalthough the Kamada technique employs the\ntelescopic technique for BD reconstruction22. To\nperform rat OLT more simply and easily and\nwithout complications, further modifications of\nsurgical techniques will be needed in the future.\nHA Reconstruction in Rat OLT\nKamada and coworkers50 have considered arterial\nreconstruction in rat OLT to be unnecessary, and,\ntherefore, the reconstruction is not part of the\nKamada OLT technique. The need for re￾arterialization varies greatly in different animal\nspecies. Reconstruction of the HA is considered an\nimportant step in liver transplantation in humans\nand large animals. Under normal conditions, the HA\nsupplies at least 50% of the oxygen needed by the\nliver, which is essential for energy production and\nregulation of metabolism51. Accidental injury,\nocclusion, or both of the HA in liver transplantation\nin humans often results in graft loss, leading to re￾transplantation, which is associated with high\nmortality rates52―54. In rats, the OLT recipient can\ntolerate the operation without arterialization, and\nthe survival rate is high in these rats50,55. Therefore,\nthe value of HA reconstruction in rat OLT has been\ndebated50,55. However, previous studies have clearly\ndemonstrated that arterialization in rat OLT\nincreases survival32,35,39, reduces microcirculatory\ndisorders56, avoids biliary complications35,57 and\nhistological changes35,41,58, and alters immunologic\nresponses32,59. Because HA reconstruction is routinely\nperformed in clinical liver transplantation, we\nbelieve that HA reconstruction in rat OLT is\nnecessary for the overall analysis of clinical\ntransplantation.\n\nThe Surgical Technique of Rat OLT\nJ Nippon Med Sch 2013; 80 (1) 13\nVarious techniques have been developed for\nhepatic re-arterialization in rat OLT (Table 2, Fig.\n7)\n20,32―48. The publications described for rat OLT\ninclude the end-to-side microsuture anastomosis of\nthe donor aorta, celiac artery, or common HA to the\nrecipient aorta or proper HA ; end-to-end\nmicrosuture anastomosis of the donor celiac artery\nor common HA to the recipient right renal artery\nafter nephrectomy or common HA; cuff preparation\nin the recipient renal artery or the recipient\ncommon HA and connecting the donor aorta,\ncommon HA, or celiac artery; connecting the proper\nHA of the donor and the recipient or donor common\nHA and recipient aorta with a splint of polyethylene\ntubing; and microvascular sleeve anastomosis of the\ndonor common HA and recipient proper HA or the\nceliac artery of the donor and the recipient.\nAs explained above, our splint technique from the\nrecipient right renal artery to donor celiac axis\nbearing the HA is a simple and short procedure free\nof complications. With our method, arterial\nreconstruction in rat OLT is easy to perform and is\nnot associated with prolongation of the entire\nprocedure or with any harmful effect to the\nrecipient. Thrombosis of the artery can be\nprevented (Fig. 6), and the reconnection procedure\ncan be performed in seconds. Taking all aspects of\nrat OLT into account, we highly recommend the\nsplint technique using the recipient right renal\nartery and the donor celiac axis bearing the HA to\nre-establish arterial perfusion of the graft.\nTraining and Learning Skills\nThe rat OLT model requires a skilled operator,\nand training for OLT is important for successful\ntransplantation60,61. For complete training before\nexperimentation, 40 to 50 OLTs per surgeon and\nmore OLTs per nonsurgeon are necessary47. The\nKamada technique for rat OLT is the standard\nmethod, and the splint technique of HA\nreconstruction is a simple procedure that is easy to\nlearn and technically accessible for surgeons and\nnonsurgeons.\nConclusion\nIn this article, we described the techniques of\nKamada for rat OLT and our recently developed\nsplint technique for HA reconstruction. Both\ntechniques are easy to perform and can be\ncompleted within a short period of time without\nmajor complications.\nAlthough the microsuture technique offers the\nmost physiologic method for anastomoses, a high\nlevel of microsurgical skill is a basic requirement.\nThe most physiologic techniques are preferred for\nlong-term survival studies, whereas the faster,\nsimpler cuff techniques of rat OLT with HA\nreconstruction are useful for short-term as well as\nlong-term survival studies. The procedure to be\nselected should be based on the defined study aims.\nWe have used the rat OLT model to assess the\npathology of liver graft rejection62,63. We anticipate a\nwider use of the rat OLT model and further\nresearch on complex issues related to liver\ntransplantation, such as transplant immunology, and\nthe mechanisms and treatment of inflammatory liver\ndisease.\nAcknowledgements: This work was supported in part\nby the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science and\nGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research: C23591881 (E.

The first method involves creating a cuff around the recipient's portal vein and infrahepatic inferior vena cava (IHCV) and attaching it to the corresponding structures of the donor liver. The second method, called the splint technique, uses a 0.3 cm-long tube inserted into the right renal artery of the recipient and secured with a silk suture. The donor hepatic artery is then attached to this tube using a similar technique. Both methods aim to improve surgical outcomes and reduce liver injury by ensuring adequate arterial supply to the transplanted liver. The authors suggest that the splint technique may be particularly beneficial for cases where there is a significant size difference between the recipient's and donor's arteries. The article provides references to support the effectiveness of these techniques in improving surgical outcomes and reducing complications such as hepatic artery thrombosis and bile duct damage. Overall, the authors argue that these methods contribute to the ongoing development of rat liver transplantation models, which are becoming increasingly important for preclinical testing of new drugs and therapies before they are tested in humans."}

The use of expanded donor \ncriteria (marginal) grafts is an option used \nworldwide to increase the organ supply for \ntransplantation. Marginal grafts are defi ned \nas those that involve the use of organs recov￾ered from elderly donors (> 60 years old) or \nthat present other harmful characteristics \nthat may give rise to the danger that these \nallografts may lead to post-transplantation \ndysfunction or primary non-function. None￾theless, the risk to recipients using such grafts \nremains imprecise and controversial.1-13\nThe guidelines for using marginal grafts \nvary from center to center. The pretransplanta￾tion liver disease status appears to be a valuable \ncriterion for allocating these organs. Neverthe￾less, there is ongoing disagreement regarding \nthis issue. Some authors have selected marginal \ngrafts for healthier patients who can tolerate \nretransplantation, whereas others have advo￾cated their unrestricted use to meet the needs \nof transplantation lists. Thus, there is a current \ndebate about the regulation and results of \nmarginal liver transplantation.1-13\nOBJECTIVE\nThe aim of this investigation was to com￾pare the effects of marginal and non-marginal \ngrafts for liver transplantation at the Liver \nTransplant Division, Hospital das Clínicas \nda Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade \nde São Paulo (HCFMUSP).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPatients\nIn order to improve methodological \naccuracy, we included in this investigation \n103 consecutive patients who had under￾gone their fi rst liver transplantation between \nJanuary 2001 and March 2006. Cases of \ntransplantation for patients with acute liver \nfailure, living donor transplantation, retrans￾plantation and sequential transplantation \nwere excluded. The patient characteristics and \nliver disease diagnoses are specifi ed in Table 1. \nThe procedure for liver graft recovery from \ndeceased donors followed the protocol for our \nstandard surgical technique.\nGraft score system\nWe assessed graft condition quality \nusing a previously described scoring sys￾tem.6,7 Briefl y, we gave a score of 1 for the \nfollowing characteristics: donor > 60 years, \norotracheal intubation period > 4 days, cold \nischemia time > 13 hours, hepatic macroste￾atosis ≥ 30%, bilirubin > 2.0 mg/dl, alanine \naminotransferase (ALT) > 170 U/l and as￾partate aminotransferase (AST) > 140 U/l. \nWe gave a score of 2 to the following: use \nof vasopressor drugs (dopamine > 10 mg/kg \nor any dose of noradrenalin or dobutamine) \nand serum sodium > 155 mEq/l. We consid￾ered the liver to be marginal when the score \nreached 3 (i.e. ≥ 3).\nPretransplantation\npatient status\nWe used the validated Model for End￾Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scoring system \nto classify recipients before their transplanta￾tion, as low MELD (< 20) and high MELD \n(≥ 20).\nExperimental groups\nWe distributed recipients into six groups: \nGroup 1 – All non-marginal liver re￾cipients; Group 2 – All marginal liver \nrecipients; Group 3 – Non-marginal livers \nfor low-MELD recipients; Group 4 – Non￾marginal livers for high-MELD recipients; \nGroup 5 – Marginal livers for low-MELD \nrecipients; Group 6 – Marginal livers for \n\n162\nSao Paulo Med J. 2008;126(3):161-5.\nNon marginal Marginal p-value\nGender\n\t Male 26 39\n\t Female 12 26\nAge (years) 45.6 ± 2.3 45.3 ± 1.7 0.991\nLiver disease etiology\n\t Virus B 7 (18.4%) 8 (12.3%) 0.401\n\t Virus C 13 (34.2%) 26 (40%) 0.674\n\t Alcoholic 6 (15.8%) 3 (4.6%) 0.072\n\t Primary biliary cirrhosis 1 (2.6%) 4 (6.1%) 0.649\n\t Cryptogenic 4 (10.5%) 4 (6.1%) 0.462\n\t Autoimmune 4 (10.5%) 11 (16.9%) 0.563\n\t Budd-Chiari 1 (2.6%) 1 (1.5%) 0.100\n\t Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy 2 (4.1%) 2 (3.1%) 0.624\n\t Secondary biliary cirrhosis 0 1 (1.5%) 0.100\n\t Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency 0 1 (1.5%) 0.100\n\t Primary sclerosing cholangitis 0 4 (6.1%) 0.293\nTable 1.

We compared groups \n1 and 2 independently from groups 3, 4, 5 \nand 6. The group distribution according to \nrecipient MELD score and graft characteris￾tics are presented in Table 2.\nParameters of assessment\nTo compare marginal and non-marginal \nrecipient outcomes, we evaluated the fol￾lowing parameters: serum peaks of aspartate \naminotransferase (AST) and alanine ami￾notransferase (ALT), one-week, one-month \nand one-year recipient survival, incidence of \nretransplantation, length of post-transplanta￾tion hospital stay and incidence of surgical \ncomplications (Tables 3 and 4).\nImmunosuppression\nThe immunosuppression was based on \ntacrolimus and corticosteroids. We weaned pa￾tients off corticosteroids within three months, \nexcepted in cases of transplantation due to au￾toimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis \nand primary sclerosis cholangitis, which were \ntreated with corticosteroid continuously.\nStatistical analysis\nWe used the Kaplan-Meyer test to com￾pare recipient survival, Fisher’s exact test to \nassess the incidence of surgical complications \nand retransplantation, and Student’s t test to \nevaluate the liver enzyme peak and length of \npost-transplant hospital stay. The significance \nlevel used was 0.05.\nRESULTS\nSixty-five grafts (63.1%) were considered \nmarginal and 38 (36.9%) were considered \nnon-marginal (Figure 1). Overall, the non￾marginal graft recipients achieved a one-month \nsurvival rate of 94.7%, whereas the marginal \ngraft recipients achieved 80.0% (Figure 2). \nLow-MELD recipients with non-marginal \ngrafts achieved better survival rates after one \nweek (93.4%) and one month (93.4%) than \ndid high-MELD recipients with marginal \nlivers (76.5% after one week and 64.7% after \none month) (Figure 3). There were no differ￾ences in survival rate between marginal and \nnon-marginal grafts for the other groups after \none week, one month and one year. Therefore, \nthere was no difference in survival between \nmarginal and non-marginal grafts at times \nbeyond the first month after transplantation. \nThis finding suggests that marginal grafts \nincrease the mortality rate only during the \nfirst month after transplantation.\nThere were no differences between the \nmarginal and non-marginal groups regarding \n\n163\nSao Paulo Med J. 2008;126(3):161-5.\nthe serum peaks of AST and ALT, incidence \nof retransplantation, length of post-transplant \nhospital stay and incidence of surgical com￾plications (Tables 3 and 4).\nDISCUSSION\nIn this study, we observed higher inci￾dence of marginal donors than in most other \ncenters that have assessed this subject.3,4,7 This \nmay be explained in two ways: differences in \ngraft grading score systems and local deficien￾cies in donor assistance.\nThere is no consensus regarding a grading \nsystem for assessing liver graft quality. Since \nthese grading systems vary from center to \ncenter, it is reasonable to assume that some \ncases were classified in different categories \ndepending on the system adopted. In the \npresent report, we used a promising scoring \nsystem adapted from Briceño et al.7\n that had \nbeen valuable in a previous investigation.6\nOur scoring system was practical and offered \na convenient assessment of liver quality at \nvarious degrees of marginal grading.\nConcerning local deficiencies, it is difficult \nto compare Brazilian organ procurement orga￾nizations with other centers that have assessed \nmarginal liver transplantation, which have \nusually been located in developed countries. \nIn Brazil, organ donation and recovery indexes \nremain poor. According to the 2006 edition of \nthe National Transplant Register (RNT) of the \nBrazilian Organ Transplantation Association \n(ABTO),14 there were only six effective donors \nper million people per year, out of 30.6 brain \ndeath notifications per million people per \nyear in Brazil. Furthermore, many physicians \nignore the legislation regarding organ dona￾tion and have misunderstandings about the \ndiagnosis of brain death and maintenance of \npotential donors.15,16 The deficiencies in organ \nprocurement and donor assistance in Brazil \nmay influence graft quality, thereby causing \nhigh incidence of marginal liver use.\nDiffering from our results, previous \nstudies have not found any differences in sur￾vival between the recipients of marginal and \nnon-marginal grafts. Nonetheless, they have \ndemonstrated higher incidence of primary \nnon-function and retransplantation among \nthe recipients of marginal grafts.3-5,8-13 This \nsuggests that the high mortality rate among \nmarginal graft recipients in the present report \nmay relate to the prolonged time that elapses \nuntil retransplantation can be performed in \npatients with primary non-function. The \nlong time it takes to find a suitable graft for \nthese critical patients may negatively affect \nthe survival rate.\n0 7 14 21 28\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nG3 (93.4%)\nG6 (64.7%)\n†\n*\nDays\nPercent survival\nFigure 3.

Transpl Int. 1996; \n9(Suppl 1):S414-7.\nREFERENCES\nAppropriate care for potential donors is \na crucial step in increasing the numbers of \norgans available for transplantation. Continu￾ing medical education on organ transplanta￾tion and public debates about this topic are \nimportant conditions for improving organ \ndonation and the quality of the recovery \ngrafts.15-17 Physicians’ training in potential \ndonor management allows application of \nmethods including hormone replacement in \norder to avoid rapid donor deterioration.18\nFurthermore, the release of accurate informa￾tion to the population about brain death and \norgan recovery following brain death affects \ndecisions on whether to authorize organ \ndonation.17\nIn this report, we observed that the first \nmonth after transplantation was decisive for \ndefining the overall marginal graft outcome \nand recipient survival. In addition, high￾MELD recipients of marginal grafts suffered \nhigh mortality within the first week after trans￾plantation. This mortality would have been \neven higher if it had not been possible to per￾form retransplantation in some patients in this \ntrial. Thus, if primary non-function occurs, \nprompt retransplantation is critical to save the \nrecipient’s life. Unfortunately, it is impossible \nto predict accurately which grafts will fail \nduring the early post-transplantation period. \nBeyond the first month after transplantation, \nthe recipients of marginal and non-marginal \ngrafts achieved similar outcomes.\nThe ideal match between recipient \nclinical status and degree of graft injury is an \nimportant issue in liver transplantation. We \nobserved high mortality within the first month \nin cases of marginal grafts transplanted into \nhigh-MELD recipients. On the other hand, \nhigh-MELD recipients of non-marginal livers \nachieved an adequate survival rate. Thus, this \nraises the question of which patients should \nbe eligible to receive a marginal liver.\nMelendez and Heaton2\n pointed towards \nthe idea that marginal grafts should be used \nonly in clinically stable patients who can \ntolerate the possibility of retransplantation. \nSimilarly, Cameron et al.13 established new \ncriteria for using marginal livers and matched \nsuch livers with younger patients with initial \ncirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer. In order \nto expand the donor pool, they used mar￾ginal organs only in low-MELD recipients, \nand non-marginal ones in high-risk patients \n(high-MELD).\nIn contrast, Pokorny et al.4\n stated that \nrefusal to use marginal grafts would decrease \ntransplantation activity, thereby increasing \nmortality on the waiting list. These authors \naccepted any marginal graft and managed \nany early graft dysfunction by means of ag￾gressive retransplantation. This practice raises \nethical controversy because retransplantation \nincreases recipient morbidity-mortality. In \naddition, it is very difficult to predict when a \nsuitable graft will become available for urgent \nretransplantation in Brazil. This situation \nmay increase early mortality, thus impeding \npatients’ chances of obtaining suitable grafts.\nWith the aim of improving the liver trans￾plantation system, a recent Brazilian federal \nlaw (Federal Decree no. 1160, May 29, 2006) \nestablished liver graft allocations based on pa￾tients’ liver disease severity instead of the usual \nchronological system, thus following the in￾ternational trend. In this system, patients with \nhigher MELD scores have priority in receiving \nliver grafts. Because of complex local situations \nregarding organ procurement, transplantation \nof marginal grafts into high-MELD recipients \nis nowadays a frequent occurrence in Brazil￾ian centers.\nOur Liver Transplantation Division \nhas one of the largest waiting lists for liver \ntransplantation in Brazil, with more than \n800 patients. Rational use of marginal graft al￾location is frequently debated in our meetings. \nWe have established a limit for transplanting \nthese marginal livers. We do not proceed with \ntransplanting any graft if the donor attains \none of the following conditions: serum sodi￾um > 180 mEq/l, creatinine > 3.0 mg/dl, AST \nand/or ALT > 600 U/l, bilirubin > 3.0 mg/dl, \ndonor age > 75 years and body weight < 30 kg \nor > 100 kg. We are currently analyzing our \nresults from liver transplantations carried \nout over the first year of this new allocation \nsystem in Brazil.\nRecently implemented pretransplantation \ntherapeutic methods have had the aim of \ncompensating for the inconvenience of organ \nshortage. Protocols combining refinements of \nliver surgery techniques and immunotherapy \ncan remove complex liver tumors, thus avoid￾ing the requirement for liver transplantation.19\nFurthermore, recent advances in biotechnol￾ogy have made it possible to apply hepatocyte \ntransplantation as a promising and less aggres￾sive procedure for treating liver disease. This \nmethod has been useful for treating metabolic \nliver disease and may reduce liver transplanta￾tion waiting lists.20\nCONCLUSION\nMarginal grafts increase early mortality \nin liver transplantation cases, and particularly \namong high-MELD patients.\n\n165\nSao Paulo Med J. 2008;126(3):161-5.\nAUTHOR INFORMATION \nTelesforo Bacchella, MD, PhD.

No entanto, isto suscita importante\ndilema ético porque esses órgãos podem aumentar a chance de insucesso do transplante. Este estudo\ncompara os resultados do transplante de órgãos marginais e não-marginais em 103 pacientes portadores\nde doença hepática crônica.\nTIPO DE ESTUDO E LOCAL: Cento e três transplantes consecutivos de fígado por doença hepática crônica\nrealizados no Serviço de Transplante de Fígado do Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da\nUniversidade de São Paulo foram retrospectivamente analisados, compreendendo o período de janeiro\nde 2001 a março de 2006.\nMÉTODOS: A qualidade do enxerto foi calculada utilizando sistema de pontuação validado. A doença\nhepática do receptor também foi classificada em MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) baixo (< 20)\ne MELD alto (≥ 20). Os parâmetros avaliados na comparação entre receptores de órgãos marginais e\nnão-marginais foram: sobrevida do paciente em uma semana, um mês e um ano, pico sérico das enzimas\nhepatocelulares, dias de internação pós-transplante e incidência de complicações cirúrgicas e retransplantes.\nO índice de significância foi de 0.05.\nRESULTADOS: Não houve diferença entre os grupos quanto ao tempo de internação pós-transplante, pico\nsérico das enzimas hepatocelulares e incidência de complicações cirúrgicas. Em contraste, a utilização\nde enxertos marginais diminuiu a sobrevida global de um mês. Os receptores de enxertos não-marginais\ncom baixo MELD apresentaram melhor sobrevida em uma semana e um mês do que os receptores de\nenxertos marginais com alto MELD. Após o período de um mês, a taxa de sobrevida foi similar até um\nano em todos os grupos.\nCONCLUSÃO: Em conclusão, o uso de enxerto marginal aumenta mortalidade precoce no transplante de\nfígado, principalmente nos receptores com alto MELD.\nPALAVRAS-CHAVE: Seleção do doador.

Outcomes measured included survival rates, liver function tests, length of hospital stays, and incidence of complications and retransplantations. The study concluded that while there was no significant difference in hospital stays, liver function tests, or complications between the two groups, the use of marginal grafts resulted in lower survival rates, particularly in high-MELD recipients, during the first month after transplantation.

However, in \nspite of a large number of LDLT, living donor liver re￾transplantation has been uncommon and rarely reported in \nliterature. According to a registry maintained by the \nJapanese Liver Transplantation Society, 2249 transplants \nhave been performed in 49 institutions throughout Japan \nuntil the end of 2002; there were 2226 LDLTs in 2164 \npatients and 23 deceased donor liver transplants.1\n These \ndata indicate that retransplantation rate following LDLT \nwas about 2.8% and most of them were living do￾nor-to-living donor liver retransplantation. In the series of \nfirst 1000 LDLTs and 155 deceased donor liver trans￾plants at Asan Medical Center, there were 11 patients who \nunderwent LDLT-associated retransplantation (retransplant￾ation from or to LDLT): Three patients received living \ndonor-to-living donor retransplantation and 8 patients un￾derwent deceased donor-to-living donor or living do￾nor-to-deceased donor retranspantation.2\n This series shows \n1.1% of LDLT-associated retransplantaion rate. On the \nother hand, the reported rate of retransplantation from \nlarge-volume deceased donor liver transplant programs \nvaried between 7% to 23%.3\n In the University of \nCalifornia Los Angeles series of 3,200 liver transplants in￾cluding 65 LDLTs, liver transplantation more than once \nwas performed in 538 patients (20.2%) of overall 2,662 \npatients.4\nThe basic reasons why LDLT-associated retransplan￾tation has been performed in such a low incidence com￾paring with deceased donor transplants might as follows: \nfirst of all, it might be very low incidence of primary \nnon-function after LDLT, which has been the most com￾mon cause of retransplantation following deceased donor \ntransplant. North American multi-center study group re￾ported that 11 (2.9%) living donor liver grafts failed as \nprimary non-function in 385 recipients and 37 patients un￾derwent retransplantation within first year mainly due to \nvascular thrombosis or primary non-function.5\n In this re-\n\n2 Korean J Hepatobiliary Pancreat Surg Vol. 17, No. 1, February 2013\nport, the type of reoperation might be living donor-to-de￾ceased donor retransplantation. The detailed clinical se￾quences of primary non-function following LDLT have \nbeen not fully understood yet. There were only one case \nreport of living donor-to-deceased donor retransplantation \ndue to primary non-function of the first liver graft.6\n The \nsecond reason for low incidence of LDLT-associated re￾transplantation might be progressive decrease of graft fail￾ure from technical faults of LDLT operation through ad￾vancement of surgical techniques and improvement of \nimaging studies for donor liver evaluation.7\n By using vari￾ous innovative techniques, the incidence of serious surgi￾cal complications after LDLT decreased significantly, by \nwhich the need for retransplantation were proportionately \nreduced.8\n The third reason is definite shortage of available \ndeceased or living donor for retransplantation.\nIn North America and Europe where deceased donor \nliver transplantation is the main type of liver trans￾plantation, deceased donor liver graft could be available \nwith a relatively short waiting time in high probability if \nan emergent retransplantation is required.5\n This implicates \nthat LDLT is primarily used for first liver transplantation \nto cope with relative shortage of deceased donor organs, \nand there is very low probability performing living do￾nor-to-living donor retransplantation. Furthermore, the \noverall case number of LDLT in these areas is much \nsmaller that those of Asian countries. As a result, in North \nAmerica and Europe, the experience of LDLT-associated \nliver retransplantation would be confined to living do￾nor-to-deceased donor retransplantation.\nOn the other hand, in Asian countries where deceased \norgan donors are in scarcity, retransplantation with either \ndeceased donor or living donor liver graft has very low \nprobability due to lack of donors. In this situation, serious \nposttransplant complication is directly related to patient \ndeath without chance of retransplantation. According to \nthe AMC experience, the main causes of early graft fail￾ure were serious complications confined to the liver graft \nsuch as hepatic artery thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis, \nhepatic outflow obstruction, massive hemorrhagic necrosis \nor unexplained severe graft dysfunction.9\n Retransplanta￾tion might have been attempted to most of these seriously \ncomplicated recipients if deceased liver donors were \navailable.\nLDLT-associated retransplantation can be classified as \nthree types according to the sequences of graft types \n(living donor-to-living donor, living donor-to-deceased \ndonor and deceased donor-to-living donor) because differ￾ent surgical techniques should be considered according to \nthe different sequences. It also should be classified into \ntwo types according to reoperation timing - early and late \n- like in ordinary deceased donor liver retransplantation.\nAfter applying these combinations, early retrans￾plantation from LDLT to deceased donor transplantation \nmight have been the most typical type in countries where \ndeceased donor organs are available. It is also the simplest \ntype of retransplantation because all structures belonging \nto the first liver grafts would be removed before formation \nof adhesion and new graft can be anastomosed to the re￾cipient's native structures. On the other hand, late retrans￾plantation to LDLT is the possible worst combination be￾cause severe adhesion, distorted structures and newly de￾veloped collateral veins would make the recipient oper￾ation very difficult or not possible. In practice, retrans￾plantation using living donor liver graft has a limited in￾dication only for life-saving purpose. The outcome of \nLDLT-associated retransplantation has not been reported \nyet in literature. Based on the Asan Medical Center expe￾rience with 11 cases of LDLT-associated retransplantation, \n1-year survival rate after retransplantation was about 60%, \nwhich is much lower than 91% following first LDLT in \n883 adult recipients.9\n The underlying cause of such low￾ering of survival rate might be inevitable miss of the opti￾mal timing for retransplantation due to donor factors.\nINCIDENCE AND INDICATIONS\nIt is presumed that only a small number of liver recipi￾ents have undergone LDLT-associated retransplantation \nworldwide to date. Living donor liver graft can be used \nfor the first or second liver transplantation. The timing of \nretransplantation also should be stratified as 2 types ac￾cording to the reoperation timing. Combination of these \ntwo classifications results in 6 types of LDLT-associated \nretransplantation. However, to our knowledge, late re￾transplantation to LDLT might have not been performed \nin most LDLT programs. Considering our experience on \nlate deceased donor retransplantation after initial LDLT or \ndeceased donor transplant, it does not seem to be reason￾able or sometimes not feasible to dissect the heavy adhe-\n\nShin Hwang, et al. Liver retransplantation for adult recipients 3\nsion around the initial partial liver graft, especially at the \nconglomerated hilar structures, to make them suitable for \nLDLT. Thus, other 4 types of LDLT-associated retrans￾plantation can be taken into account.\nThe most typical type of LDLT-associated retransplant￾ation might be early living donor-to-deceased donor re￾transplantation. Any cause of early graft failure can be in￾dicated for this type of retransplantation if a deceased do￾nor organ is available: it includes primary non-function, \nearly severe dysfunction or major surgical complications \nconfined to the liver graft, which are much similar to \nthose of deceased donor liver transplantation. Although \nthe incidence of primary non-function following LDLT \nhas been sporadically commented in literature, the actual \nincidence has been unknown so far after exclusion of the \ntechnical factors during learning curve.5,6,10 According to \nthe Asan Medical Center experience, its incidence was \ndefinitely less than 1% if strict definition of primary \nnon-function was applied. Severe initial dysfunction of the \nliving donor liver graft was often associated with \nsmall-for-size graft, excessive venous congestion of the \nright lobe graft from hepatic outflow obstruction or portal \nflow steal syndrome. Serious hepatic artery-related com￾plications including hepatic artery thrombosis occurred in \n2-5% at large-volume LDLT programs and became a \nleading cause of early graft failure following LDLT.11-13\nIntractable biliary complication also can be an indication \nof retransplantation because its clinical course could be \nintractable and it occasionally induced life-threatening \nsepsis.14,15 If the general condition of a patient can endure \nthe retransplantation procedure itself, there might be no \nabsolute contraindication specific for this type of retrans￾plantation. Thus, it shares the same retransplantation in￾dication criteria with initial deceased donor liver trans￾plantation.\nFor early living donor-to-living donor retransplantation, \nits eligibility criteria might be similar to those of early \nliving donor-to-deceased donor retransplantation, but tech￾nical feasibility should be considered first. The most im￾portant point is the availability of hepatic arterial blood \nflow source. A reliable arterial flow source other than the \nhepatic artery proper is the right gastroepiploic artery be￾cause it can be easily mobilized toward the hepatic hilum \nafter detachment from the stomach and can be promptly \nenlarged to facilitate size-mismatching. The clinical sig￾nificance of this artery was proven in its use for \nLDLT.11,16 If it is not possible to use this artery before \nreoperation, living donor retransplantation should not be \nattempted or fresh arterial vessel graft should be sought \nfrom deceased organ donors.\nFor early deceased donor-to-living donor retransplant￾ation, its indications are exactly the same to those for \naforementioned living donor-to-living donor retransplant￾ation unless extensive hepatic artery thrombosis occurred. \nHilar dissection of the failed whole liver graft is com￾parable to that of liver dissection during initial LDLT. If \nhepatic arterial thrombosis was the cause of graft failure, \nalternative arterial flow source such as right gastroepiploic \nartery should be searched first.\nLate deceased donor retransplantation after initial LDLT \nhas the same indication for ordinary late deceased donor \nretransplantation such as recurrence of hepatitis C cir￾rhosis or chronic rejection. This type of retransplantation \nis considered to carry an increased risk comparable to the \nrepeated deceased donor retransplantation.17-20 As there is \nno short-cut to dissect heavy adhesions, the timing of de￾ceased donor and recipient operations should be ad￾equately adjusted not to make the cold preservation time \ntoo much prolonged.21,22\nTECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR \nLDLT-ASSOCIATED RETRANSPLANTATION\nThe difficulty of the recipient operation usually depends \non the timing of retransplantation. Early emergency re￾transplantation such as reoperation within the first week \ndoes not require difficult dissection process because there \nis little adhesion around the liver graft. Retransplantation \nafter an interim period such as 1-3 months would make \nadhesions from mild to severe degree. Although minute \ncollateral vasculatures are not usually developed in the ad￾hesion of this time, meticulous sharp dissection is man￾datory to secure the dissection effectively. For late re￾transplantation after progression of viral hepatitis or \nchronic rejection, heavy adhesion and new development \nof portal venous collaterals would be encountered. Every \nadhesion should be cut sharply and every bleeding point \nshould be strictly controlled during the dissection process. \nBlunt dissection of such adhesion should be avoided be￾cause it can induce massive uncontrollable bleeding from \n\n4 Korean J Hepatobiliary Pancreat Surg Vol. 17, No. 1, February 2013\nthe widely dissected surface in the situation of portal \nhypertension. Except for early retransplantation, retrans￾plantation operation usually takes much longer operation \ntime for dissection than in the initial operation, so experi￾ence-based scheduling of donor and recipient operations \nis important not to prolong cold preservation time or liv￾ing donor operation time.21,22\nEarly living donor-to-deceased donor retrans￾plantation\nAfter the main operative wound for initial LDLT is \nopened, gentle blunt dissection with fingers would make \nthe gelatinous or mild adhesion separate from the liver \ngraft. Hepatic hilar structures should be manipulated gen￾tly, but the hepatic artery and common bile duct may not \nbe suitable to reuse for deceased donor retransplantation. \nRetrohepatic inferior vena cava should be dissected fur￾ther especially cephalad to enable deep secure clamping \nof the suprahepatic vena cava over the diaphragm because \nthe hepatic vein cuffs are nearly absent. As the cephalad \nend of right hepatic vein orifice is located very close to \nthe diaphragm, deep diaphragm clamping is mandatory to \nsecure suprahepatic vena cava anastomosis.\nIn this type of retransplantation, the common hepatic \nartery may not be suitable for arterial anastomosis; ad￾equate branch patch cannot be made because all branches \nother than previously anastomosed branch were ligated \nalready. Blood outflow from the right gastroepiploic ar￾tery often appears to be too small to perfuse the whole \nliver graft reliably. Thus, arterial interposition graft should \nbe taken into account. Infrarenal aortic jump graft has \nbeen preferred to supraceliac aortic graft.\nAfter complete dissection of the old graft and inferior \nvena cava, the retransplantation procedure proceeds as \nroutine like in deceased donor-to-deceased donor \nretransplantation. Piggyback technique with side-to-side or \nend-to-side cavocaval reconstruction is not recommended \nbecause the use of such methods did not seem to have \nno advantage when comparing with the standard techni￾que.23-25 LDLT has often used duct-to-duct anastomosis, \nso the condition of recipient bile duct is usually not \nenough good to re-do duct anastomosis. Thus, Roux-en-Y \ncholedochojejunostomy is highly recommended.26,27\nEarly living donor-to-living donor retrans￾plantation\nFor this type of retransplantation, the type of second \nliver graft and hepatic arterial inflow source should be \nconsidered prudently. As this retransplantation is performed \nin a highly morbid situation, suboptimal donor graft such \nas graft size smaller than 40% of the recipient's standard \nliver volume should not be used considering the severity \nof pre-retransplant condition.28-30 Donor livers with variant \nliver anatomy such as variant portal vein or hepatic artery \ncannot be used.11,13,31,32 If a right lobe graft is used, hep￾atic venous congestion should be minimized through inter￾position reconstruction or concurrent procurement of the \nmiddle hepatic vein.33-36 Arterial flow source is another \nimportant point to be considered before this type of re￾transplantation because it is usually not feasible to use the \nproper hepatic arterial branch again even in the favorable \nsituations with no hepatic artery thrombosis. Splenic ar￾tery is usually not suitable for arterial reconstruction of \nLDLT due to its limited length and diameter discrepancy. \nIt is not preferred to use the cryopreserved vessel graft \nfor arterial reconstruction due to a high risk of arterial \nthrombosis or potential pseudoaneurysm formation although \nsuccessful outcomes have been sporadically reported.37-39 \nInstead, fresh arterial graft from a deceased donor can be \nused like in primary LDLT for recipients with destructed \nhepatic artery. For such purpose, it is reasonable to pro￾cure the superior mesenteric artery graft from a deceased \ndonor during procurement of iliac artery grafts because \nsuperior mesenteric artery has many small branches \nmatching to right or left hepatic artery of the partial liver \ngraft. Another reliable source of hepatic arterial flow is \nthe right gastroepiploic artery. In practice, in such a sit￾uation requiring arterial blood flow source other than in￾nate hepatic arteries, the right gastroepiploic artery has \nbeen the most preferable artery for LDLT because of its \ninvariable anatomical location, size, and length. This ar￾tery often looks too small at a glance, but it can be rapidly \ndilated after clamping for a short time. As this artery is \nfed from the arterial arcades at the pancreatic head not \nto mention of the gastroduodenal artery, usual hepatic ar￾tery thrombosis without extension to the celiac axis usu￾ally does not have negative influence on its blood flow. \nThese merits of the right gastroepiploic artery as a sub￾stitute source for hepatic arterial flow have led to use it \n\nShin Hwang, et al. Liver retransplantation for adult recipients 5\nfor multiple or re-do arterial reconstruction in LDLT. \nPreoperative selective arteriography or three-demensional \nreconstruction of computed tomographic angiography can \nbe used for its preoperative evaluation.40\nFor removal of the old graft and secure anastomosis of \nthe hepatic vein, deep secure suprahepatic vena cava \nclamping over the diaphragm should be prepared like in \ndeceased donor retransplantation. As prolonged vena cava \nclamping is often required, active venovenous bypass \nwould be beneficial.\nAfter complete dissection of the old graft and inferior \nvena cava, the retransplantation procedure proceeds as \nroutine like in primary LDLT. Portal vein should be cut \nclose the old liver graft across the anastomotic line, and \nthen suture material should be removed. Similar principle \nwould be applied to the hepatic vein orifice. After vena \ncaval clamping, the liver parenchyma should be cut to \nleave some tissue at the hepatic vein orifice. After that, \nsuture material should be removed to preserve the edge \nof hepatic vein orifice intact.\nTechnically, the use of a partial graft of same type is \nof advantage for intra-abdominal space occupation and \nhepatic vein reconstruction. The same stump of portal \nvein can be usable for portal vein reconstruction. Hepatic \nvein stump can be used like in primary LDLT. When us￾ing the right gastroepiploic artery for alternative hepatic \narterial flow source, it is necessary to straighten the anas￾tomosis site not to make a kinking deformity. To avoid \naccidental excessive tension at the arterial anastomosis \nsite, it is necessary to transfix the artery to the surround￾ing structure such as gastric antrum before performing \nother procedure. The recipient bile duct which had been \nused for biliary reconstruction is not acceptable for \nduct-to-duct anastomosis, so Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunos￾tomy is mandatory.\nEarly deceased donor-to-liver donor retrans￾plantation\nThis type of retransplantation has been usually applied \nto primary non-function of the first deceased donor liver \ngraft. Thus, all vascular structures should remain intact. \nIn contrast, the cause of first graft failure is vascular com￾plication such as hepatic artery thrombosis, portal vein \nstenosis or vena cava stensosis, such patient may not be \nindicated for this type of retransplantation. Any type of \nliving donor liver graft can be implantable like a first \nLDLT, but right lobe graft is desirable due to stable settle￾ment of the partial liver graft in the right subphrenic \nfossa. Hilar vascular structures and retrohepatic vena cava \nof the failed liver graft should be dissected like in primary \nLDLT. Vena cava and portal vein of the first graft should \nbe left as interposition grafts. Hepatic artery of the first \ngraft can be used as interposition graft, or other source \nof arterial blood flow such as gastroepiploic artery can be \nused alternatively. Since the retrohepatic inferior vena \nshould be fully preserved, both supra- and infrahepatic \nanastomotic lines should be protected carefully. The portal \nvein of the first graft should be dissected, but this process \nis not difficult because the failed liver has nearly normal \nconsistency and hilar structures are dissected already. It \nis not recommended to use the hepatic artery branch of \nthe first graft,3\n but there might be not worse than using \nother type of jump graft. Based on the AMC experience, \nthis arterial interposition did not result in any arterial \ncomplication. Alternatively, the right gastroepiploic artery \ncan be used as arterial flow source without interposition \nof deceased vessel graft. Duct-to-duct anastomosis is not \nfeasible because the proximal portion of recipient bile \nduct had been already removed during first operation. \nThere is no choice of biliary reconstruction other than \nhepaticojejunostomy.\nLate living donor-to-liver donor retrans￾plantation\nIt is almost not practical to perform this type of retrans￾plantation because of heavy adhesion and distorted the hi￾lar structures not permitting sufficient dissection.\nLate living donor-to-deceased donor retrans￾plantation\nHeavy adhesion and prominent venous collateral would \nbe encountered during recipient operation. Piggyback \ntechnique may be not feasible and not recommended due \nto heavy adhesion around the retrohepatic inferior vena \ncava. Dissection of the main portal vein which had been \nonce dissected would require meticulous sharp dissection. \nCommon hepatic artery patch or aortic jump graft is used. \nThere is no choice other than Roux-en-Y choledochoje￾junostomy.\n\n6 Korean J Hepatobiliary Pancreat Surg Vol. 17, No. 1, February 2013\nLate deceased donor-to-liver donor retrans￾plantation\nThis type of retransplantation is also a kind of least rec￾ommended type like late living donor-to-living donor \nretransplantation. Surgical technique would be similar to \nthat of early deceased donor-to-living donor retransplant￾ation, but the difficulty of hilar dissection varies depend￾ing on the patient conditions.\nOUTCOME OF LDLT-ASSOCIATED \nRETRANSPLANTATION\nSince LDLT-associated retransplantation has been per￾formed in a small number of patients worldwide, its out￾come cannot be assessed statistically unlike in deceased \ndonor re-transplantation. Furthermore, LDLT itself in￾dicates shortage of deceased donor organs, so optimal re￾transplantation timing might have been missed in patients \nwith failing first liver graft. Considering the real situation \nof deceased organ shortage and limited availability of liv￾ing donor, the outcome of LDLT-associated retrans￾plantation might be naturally worse than that of deceased \ndonor retransplantation. Although deceased donor retrans￾plantation revealed higher morbidity and lower survival \nthan primary transplantation, 1-year survival in adult recip￾ients became about 70% in recent literature.17,41 Consider￾ing the disadvantageous situation of LDLT-associated re￾transplantation, the result of about 60% 1-year survival \nfrom the Asan Medical Center series is comparable to the \nresult from deceased donor retransplantation. Late de￾ceased donor retransplantation has been often performed \nfor patients with hepatitis C virus infection, but this dis￾ease was associated with lower patient and graft survival \ncompared with retransplantation for other causes.42 It may \nbe reasonable to expect the similar outcome after LDLT￾associated retransplantation in patients with viral hepatitis C.\nREFERENCES\n1.

The authors highlight the importance of careful selection of both donors and recipients, as well as the need for ongoing monitoring and follow-up to manage complications and optimize outcomes. They also suggest strategies for managing complications such as biliary strictures, hepatic artery thrombosis, and portal vein thrombosis, and explore the role of advanced imaging techniques in evaluating donor and recipient candidates. Additionally, they address the issue of retransplantation, discussing the indications, risks, and outcomes of this procedure, as well as the technical considerations involved in performing retransplantation. Overall, the authors call for continued research and innovation in the field of living-donor liver transplantation to improve outcomes and reduce complications."}
