    "summary": "This article discusses several topics related to healthcare and medicine. Firstly, it presents a study that investigates the association between organ donation rates and laws assuming presumed consent. The study compares countries with and without presumed consent legislation and finds that presumed consent is associated with higher organ donation rates, although other factors also play a role. Secondly, the article highlights the issue of re-infection among people who currently inject drugs and the need to promote ongoing hepatitis C testing and re-treatment. Thirdly, it touches upon the topic of publication bias in neuroscience research due to the dominance of significance testing and the flexibility of alternative approaches. Lastly, the article emphasizes the importance of addressing the complexities of study designs, sample sizes, and search for increasingly subtle effects in light of the growing body of preclinical literature failures and the correspondingly poor translation of these findings into humans. The article concludes by suggesting ways to combat disease mongering, such as making the sale of preventive technologies in countries with above-average expectation of life conditional on the availability of treatment for diseases causing the most catastrophic shortening of life in poor countries.\n\nIn terms of healthcare delivery, the article mentions a successful effort by a large healthcare organization to implement the Chronic Care Model (CCM) for managing patients with chronic conditions. The study recommends choosing selective care processes carefully, respecting cultural and work relationships, involving and engaging stakeholders, and attending to work relationships to maximize engagement and contribution to the changes. Additionally, the article proposes taxation or other means to make the sale of preventive technologies conditional on the availability of treatment for diseases causing the most catastrophic shortening of life in poor countries.\n\nOverall, the article covers various issues related to healthcare and medicine, ranging from organ donation rates, re-infection among people who currently inject drugs, publication bias in neuroscience research, healthcare delivery, and ways to combat disease mongering.",

There are many\nworkforce development projects underway in Australia,\nthat aim to build the capacity of primary care practitioners\nand ensure that people with hepatitis C have multiple\naccess points to DAA treatment; these programs need to\nbe sustained overtime.\nFuture promotion of the next wave of DAA candidates\nin Australia should draw on the firsthand experiences of\npeople who have been through the DAA treatment and\nhave achieved cure, including people who currently in￾ject drugs. Roger’s ‘Diffusion of Innovations’ theory seeks\nto explain how, why, and at what rate new innovations\n(ideas, technology and/or products) gain momentum\nand diffuse or spread through a specific population.\nThis theory suggests that when an innovation, in this\ncase, DAAs, are promoted by respected individuals\nwithin a social network, it creates a desire to adopt\nthe innovation [26]. This perspective is supported by\nresearch that shows that people with hepatitis C have\nplayed an important role in engaging people who inject\ndrugs with hepatitis C in treatment services [27–30].\nThe limitations of this study should be acknowledged\nwhen interpreting the data; the small sample size and in￾herent limitations regarding the generalisability of quali￾tative data at a population level and the timing of\nrecruitment during the early stages of the DAA imple￾mentation in Australia could all affect the relevance of\nthis data to the current cohort of people seeking DAA\ntreatment. Study participants most likely represent early\nadopters of the DAAs, who sought out the treatment be￾cause they were well informed and motivated, compared\nto people currently accessing treatment who have pre￾ferred to wait and gather evidence of the DAA’s success.\nThe environment, in terms of the public’s and health\nworkforce’s awareness has most likely improved over time,\nmaking access to treatment less reliant on highly moti￾vated individuals. The focus of this study was on partici￾pants’ experiences of being cured, therefore, demographic\ninformation about participants’ age, mode of infection and\nliver disease staging were not systematically collected. The\nauthors acknowledge that these factors may influence peo￾ple’s experience of being cured of hepatitis C.\nMost participants in this study found DAAs easy to\ntake with generally mild and manageable side-effects.\nNonetheless they indicated it was important to acknow￾ledge the potential for DAA side effects, as this would\nenable people to plan and establish contingency plans\nfor the treatment course and support adherence. Overall,\nadherence to the DAAs was not an issue of concern, in\nthis study, participants described how they identified\ntheir own memory hooks and existing routines to sup￾port the daily administration of the DAAs [31]. However,\nthese participants were particularly motivated to achieve\na cure. In the future, more planning and support may be\nneeded to support adherence for people who are more\nsceptical about the DAAs and of their own need to\nachieve a cure.\nThe perspectives of participants who currently inject\ndrugs illustrates that the availability and effectiveness of\nDAAs are not the only factors that influence their\ndecision to start treatment, which is supported by\nGoutzamanis and colleagues (2016) [32]. Health promo￾tion messages need to shift the perceptions of current\ninjectors around treatment and re-treatment to ensure\nthey understand that DAAs are universally available and\npeople who currently inject are a priority population for\ntreatment access. In providing hepatitis C treatment and\ncare, clinicians, pharmacists and other service providers\nshould highlight the individual health benefits of\nre-treatment and the population level benefits of stop￾ping onward transmission. The issue of re-infection also\ndemonstrates the importance of promoting ongoing\nhepatitis C testing for current injectors and for continu￾ing investment in harm reduction programs including",

The\nsmall number of studies identified may be the result of\nour searchesfailing to identify all relevant publications,\nsuch evaluations not being performed, or the findings\nof evaluations not being publicly available. Others\nhave noted the difficulties in obtaining documentation\nabout the effects of national-level initiatives9 and the\nfact that strategic policies tend not to receive the same\nevaluative attention as, for example, medical\nprocedures.10\nThe available studies had methodological weak￾nesses. We evaluated three different types of research\nevidence—before and after studies, between country\ncomparisons using secondary data, and surveys.\nUnlike evaluations of medical interventions, the\n“hierarchy” of evidence is not clear when evaluating\na policy such as a change in legislation. The before and\nafter studies and the cross country comparisons each\nhave strengths and weaknesses. Before and after studies\nhave a quasi-experimental design and provide evi￾dence on the experience of individual countries, but\ntheir usefulness was limited by the small number of\ncountries covered and the lack of information about,\nand in-depth analysis of, any structural and contextual\nchanges during the same time period. Such changes\nmight have contributed to the increases in donation\nrates.\nThe studies comparing different countries per￾formed secondary analysis of data obtained from\ncountries with and without presumed consent legisla￾tion in place. They can show only associations between\nlegislation and organ donation rates, but they had the\nadvantage of exploring the impact of other important\nfactors such as mortality from road traffic accidents.\nEach study included explanatory factors based on what\nthe authors considered important, and these varied\nbetween studies, as didtheir relative importance.Other\nfactors likely to be important were not investigated. For\nexample, Catholicism was the only religion consid￾ered, despite the likely importance of other religions\nsuch as Islam and Judaism, which have been reported\nto have a negative impact on organ donation rates.11\nThe countries represented in the studies were mainly\nWestern European. Although this increases the like￾lihood that the findings are generalisable to the UK, it\nresulted in considerable overlap between the samples\nused. This duplication means that the studies are\nnaturally biased towards giving similar results.\nAlthough presumed consent is not a binary variable,\nit has been treated as such in the between country\ncomparisons. Countries vary in the nature of their\nlegislation and how the legislation is interpreted. Of\nkey importance is the extent of consultation about\ndonation with relatives of the deceased. This was partly\naddressed in one study that compared countries on the\nbasis of how legislation was implemented in practice,\nrather than the actual legislation in place.w8 Regardless\nof the legislative system, the procedures for contact\nwith relatives of newly deceased people are likely to be\nimportant determinants in whether consent is given.\nThe surveys provided useful information about\npublic attitudes to presumed consent, but important\nmethodological detail was not available in four of the\nsurveys and caution is needed in the interpretation of\nthe findings. There was also little exploration of\npotential differences across sociodemographic groups.\nIn addition, attitudes alone are unlikely to be a reliable\npredictor of behaviour. This is already reflected in the\ngap between high levels of support for organ donation\nin UK surveys and lower rates of registration on the\norgan donor register.\nConclusions\nThe available evidence suggeststhat presumed consent\nis associated with increased organ donation rates, even\nwhen other factors are accounted for. However, it\ncannot be inferred from this that the introduction of\npresumed consent legislation per se will lead to an",

Similarly, adopting conservative priors \ncan substantially reduce the likelihood of claiming that \nan effect exists when in fact it does not85. At present, \nsignificance testing remains the dominant framework \nwithin neuroscience, but the flexibility of alternative (for \nexample, Bayesian) approaches means that they should \nbe taken seriously by the field.\nConclusions and future directions\nA consequence of the remarkable growth in neurosci￾ence over the past 50 years has been that the effects we \nnow seek in our experiments are often smaller and more \nsubtle than before as opposed to when mostly easily dis￾cernible ‘low-hanging fruit’ were targeted. At the same \ntime, computational analysis of very large datasets is now \nrelatively straightforward, so that an enormous number of \ntests can be run in a short time on the same dataset. These \ndramatic advances in the flexibility of research design and \nanalysis have occurred without accompanying changes to \nother aspects of research design, particularly power. For \nexample, the average sample size has not changed sub￾stantially over time88 despite the fact that neuroscientists \nare likely to be pursuing smaller effects. The increase in \nresearch flexibility and the complexity of study designs89\ncombined with the stability of sample size and search for \nincreasingly subtle effects has a disquieting consequence: \na dramatic increase in the likelihood that statistically sig￾nificant findings are spurious. This may be at the root of \nthe recent replication failures in the preclinical literature8\nand the correspondingly poor translation of these findings \ninto humans90.\nLow power is a problem in practice because of the \nnormative publishing standards for producing novel, \nsignificant, clean results and the ubiquity of null \nhypothesis significance testing as the means of evaluat￾ing the truth of research findings. As we have shown, \nthese factors result in biases that are exacerbated by low \npower. Ultimately, these biases reduce the reproducibil￾ity of neuroscience findings and negatively affect the \nvalidity of the accumulated findings. Unfortunately, \npublishing and reporting practices are unlikely to \nchange rapidly. Nonetheless, existing scientific practices \ncan be improved with small changes or additions that \napproximate key features of the idealized model4,91,92. \nWe provide a summary of recommendations for future \nresearch practice in BOX 2.\nIncreasing disclosure. False positives occur more fre￾quently and go unnoticed when degrees of freedom in \ndata analysis and reporting are undisclosed5\n. Researchers \ncan improve confidence in published reports by noting \nin the text: “We report how we determined our sample \nsize, all data exclusions, all data manipulations, and all \nmeasures in the study.”7\n When such a statement is not \npossible, disclosure of the rationale and justification of \ndeviations from what should be common practice (that \nis, reporting sample size, data exclusions, manipula￾tions and measures) will improve readers’ understand￾ing and interpretation of the reported effects and, \ntherefore, of what level of confidence in the reported \neffects is appropriate.

Choose selective care processes that have been well \nworked out in similar settings, or devote time to careful \ndesign and piloting before tackling implementation.\n2. Use the CCM as a backdrop for leaders to under￾stand the relationships and roles of specifi c care changes \nneeded, not as the change blueprint or training model.\n3. Recognize and respect the diffi culty of changing \ntraditional care patterns. Organizational and professional \ncultures are critical to any change and require as much \nattention as the implementation, so fi rst understand and \nalign your organization’s culture with the strategies being \nchosen.29 Attend to work relationships; when functioning \nwell, they should engage and empower all stakeholders \nto invest in and contribute to the changes.30\n4. Involve and engage physicians in both the care \nand change processes, or change will be stymied and \nthe impact on patient outcomes will be limited.\n5. Give individual clinics clear models and speci￾fi cations about the desired end, as well as latitude in \nhow they get there.\n6. Provide strong leadership vision, along with \nchange management skills, and ample resources at the \nlevel of both overall organization and individual clinics.\n7. Monitor closely what is going on, and adjust as \nchange barriers emerge. \n8. Focus, focus, focus! Large changes require strong \nprioritization and ongoing concentration of organiza￾tional attention, resources, time, and energies.\n9. Change takes time, probably twice as long as you \nthink. Pace the work, giving time and space for essen￾tial group learning and refl ection.31\n10. Allow for the unexpected. Complexity science \nsuggests that surprise is inherent in organizational \nchange, offering as much opportunity for learning and \ncreativity as threat of failure for those open to it.32,33\n11. Appreciate that concurrent organizational \nchanges may be unavoidable, even when it would be \nbetter to separate them.\nThis study is limited in being observational and \nincluding only a few clinics with varying change suc￾cess within one large care system. Interviews and clinic \nobservations were made at single points in a much \nlonger time span of changes. In addition, although the \noverall change effort was intended as implementation of \nthe CCM, it largely focused on the elements of delivery \nsystem design (PPTs) and on clinical information system \nchanges (EMR). This medical group’s experience may be \nbest viewed as an exploration in organizational change. \nStudy credibility is enhanced by the research team’s \nextensive experience in studying clinical practices and",

            "text": "Both Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May \nhave recently expressed their support \nfor a change to the law in England to \nintroduce an opting-out system for organ \ndonation, and the Department of Health \nis consulting on the issue. This is based \non the assumption that it would make \na significant impact on the shortage of \norgans for transplantation and thus save \nhundreds of lives each year. It is a popular \nassumption, because the intention is so \nobviously well meaning. Sadly, though, it is \nan assumption that offers false hope.\nWOULD A CHANGE IN THE LAW \nINCREASE DECEASED DONATION?\nThere is no good evidence from anywhere \nin the world that a change in the law \nleads to a sustained increase in donation. \nIndeed, there are countries where in fact \ndonation has decreased, and Brazil offers \nperhaps the best example of this. The few \npublications that suggest a possible benefit \nhave important methodological flaws that \nmake it very difficult to isolate the impact \nof the law.1\n The evidence was reviewed in \ngreat detail as part of the second Organ \nDonation Taskforce report in 2008,2\n and \nlittle has changed since then. So what is \nthe basis for the assumption? There are at \nleast two important misunderstandings in \nthe case that are often made. First, there \nis the superficially attractive observation \nof the Spanish donation experience. Spain \nhas opting-out legislation and for many \nyears has had the highest donation rate in \nthe world. But the Spanish authorities have \nstated repeatedly that their ‘success’ does \nnot stem from the law.3\n Opting out was \nintroduced in Spain in 1979, with no apparent \neffect. Ten years later, in 1989, a national \ntransplant organisation was established \nwith a wide-ranging brief to transform the \ndonation system, based primarily on the \nemployment of medically qualified donor \ncoordinators in every hospital. The effects \nwere immediate, and Spain has led the way \nsince then. The Spanish model has been \nintroduced successfully in other regions and \ncountries, including northern Italy, Croatia, \nand Portugal. There were no changes in the \nlaw, but there were dramatic increases in \norgan donation as a result of nationally led \nchanges in clinical practice in intensive care \nunits (ICUs). Moreover, Spain does not in \nfact operate an opting-out system — there \nis no register for people to either opt in or \nopt out. As in England, consent for donation \nis explicit and comes either from the patient \nin life or through their family. \nThere is one other important factor \nrelevant to the Spanish success: different \ncountries have different numbers of \npotential donors. Very few patients die in \ncircumstances that allow organ donation \nto proceed (about one in a 100 in the \nUK). For clinical and practical reasons the \npatient must die from the ‘right’ diseases \n(that is, be free of transmissible agents \nsuch as cancer and significant infections), \nin the ‘right’ place (that is, in hospital \nand probably in an ICU), and in the ‘right’ \nway (that is, death must be, at least to \nsome extent, expected and predictable). \nMost donors have suffered a catastrophic \nbrain injury from intracerebral bleeding, \ntrauma, or hypoxia, and have been treated \nin intensive care. For many years Spain has \nhad between two and three times as many \nICU beds per capita compared with the UK. \nDifferent resources and approaches to end￾of-life care result in different numbers of \npotential donors — and therefore of actual \ndonors.\nSecond, a common misunderstanding \nis that under current opt-in legislation ‘in \norder to be a donor you have to have opted \nin, by joining the NHS Organ Donor Register \n(ODR)’. Because only 36% of the population \nhave signed up there is a false belief that \nthe other 64% will never be donors, because \nthey haven’t opted in. In fact, in the UK last \nyear the families of almost all brain dead \npotential donors were approached about \ndonation,4\n regardless of whether the patient",

But they still control the purse strings and as\nsuch they still have a lot of kind of ‘leverage over’ –\nbecause they can always say, if you’re not going to\nbehave the way we want you to, we’ll find another\nagency that will.\nImportantly, funding arrangements varied in terms of\nhow professional time could be flexibly deployed, for in￾stance, for patient care, team meetings and collaborative\ncase management. Revisioning the use of time was a\ncritical strategy.\n3. Revision use of time to meet the needs of client\npopulations\nTime and its use are crucial considerations, in terms of\nexpectations regarding ‘how long’ it should take to see\nhealth improvements, and how providers use time. Work￾ing with populations whose health is so closely linked with\nsocial and economic conditions can seem slow or stagnant\nwith respect to improvements in short- and long-term out￾comes. Rather than constructing patients as ‘non￾compliant’ or as failing to achieve goals, the Centre’s\nproviders recognized how broader contexts influenced\npeople’s health trajectories and decisions. The collective\nexpertise of staff and interdisciplinary teams was used to\ndetermine when to support or ‘push’ patients to go a step\nfurther in moving toward their potential. This was\nparticularly evident in relation to substance use and\naddictions issues, adhering to anti-retroviral treatments,\nsafe-guarding against interpersonal violence, or working\ntoward healthy parenting skills. Staff sought patient’s\ninput about goals, discerning the patients’ readiness and\nsupporting steps to prepare for change – a process\nthat required long-term strategies and commitment.\nA patient described the impact of not “approaching\nme too fast”:\nWhat this place did for me was, actually, it really did\nhelp me out. Because it gave me a sense of security, a\nsense of trust with these people. And for me that’s a\nhard thing to do, just to trust people. Especially\nmanagers and staff members of any type....And staff\nmembers don’t approach me too fast, too hard and too\nquick, which is important, I believe. So, it’s, let me sort\nof come to you. And because it’s hard for me to ask for\nthings...it’s hard for me to ask for help. So the staff\nhere are patient with that. And I think they understand\nthat, which is important.\nRevisioning the use of time also refers to cultivating\nhealth care relationships over time. Time is required for\nparticipatory engagement of patients, and is fostered by\nadopting clinic structures that encourage ‘patient activa￾tion’, such as patient-initiated appointments scheduled\non a drop-in or pre-booked basis. Such scheduling struc￾tures need to be creative, fluid, and innovative to accom￾modate people’s rapidly shifting priorities and concerns,\nas this provider explained:\nSo someone might come in and you think that they\nare going to be here for their ear infection. But then,\nyou get to know them on a broader level, so you can\nsay like, \"how are things going at home?” And to\nreally be able to see people in an ongoing way, and\nsay like, \"so where are you living now? And you know\nand how’s it going?\"... So then you can have the\nopportunity and the time and the resources to address\nthose issues.\nRevisioning time also means recognizing the com￾plexity of the work involved in providing PHC to mar￾ginalized populations. Organizationally, this required\nrecog nizing the need (and scheduling time) for inter￾disciplinary meetings; putting in place adequate time\nand processes to support staff to provide care to people\nwho are highly traumatized; and providing flexibility in\nscheduling so that patients with greater needs are\nprovided more time. This strategy in turn requires\ncollaborative decision-making.\n4.

Politicians have a responsibility, \nalongside doctors and many others, to \nmake such care available, and this in \nitself will be an important part of the \nway forward. \nThe huge amount of money \nthat can be made from preventive \ntechnologies has diminished the \neconomic importance of treatment \ntechnologies, particularly for those \nillnesses that primarily affect poorer \npeople in poorer countries [18]. This \nhas meant a shift of attention from \nthe sick to the well and from the poor \nto the rich [19]. This effect of global \nmarkets requires a response in the \nform of an assertion of global human \nsolidarity. Health inequalities matter \nglobally as well as locally. A way forward \nmight be through taxation or other \nmeans, to make the sale of preventive \ntechnologies in countries with above￾average expectation of life conditional \non the availability of treatment for \nthose diseases that cause the most \ncatastrophic shortening of life in poor \ncountries. \n Conclusion\nHuman societies are riven by the effects \nof greed and fear. The rise of preventive \nhealth technologies has opened up \na new arena of human greed, which \nresponds to an enduring fear. The \ngreed is for ever-greater longevity; the \nfear is that of dying. The irony and the \ntragedy is that the greed infl ates the \nfear and poisons the present in the \nname of a better, or at least a longer, \nfuture.

We expect that these re￾sults will prompt our health care organizations to use\nthese data, and also apply a similar procedure to the one\ncurrently described to take decisions on drug coverage.\nImplementation of such procedure would help to estab￾lish appropriate priorities to allocate economic resources\nbased on objective evidence.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that JEC, JFE, JJG and LG have no competing interests,\nwhile EA and MW are employees of Bristol Myers Squibb.\nAuthors' contributions\nJJG conceived the study and coordinated the project.

        "DAAs is not a sustainable response. There are many\nworkforce development projects underway in Australia,\nthat aim to build the capacity of primary care practitioners\nand ensure that people with hepatitis C have multiple\naccess points to DAA treatment; these programs need to\nbe sustained overtime.\nFuture promotion of the next wave of DAA candidates\nin Australia should draw on the firsthand experiences of\npeople who have been through the DAA treatment and\nhave achieved cure, including people who currently in￾ject drugs. Roger’s ‘Diffusion of Innovations’ theory seeks\nto explain how, why, and at what rate new innovations\n(ideas, technology and/or products) gain momentum\nand diffuse or spread through a specific population.\nThis theory suggests that when an innovation, in this\ncase, DAAs, are promoted by respected individuals\nwithin a social network, it creates a desire to adopt\nthe innovation [26]. This perspective is supported by\nresearch that shows that people with hepatitis C have\nplayed an important role in engaging people who inject\ndrugs with hepatitis C in treatment services [27–30].\nThe limitations of this study should be acknowledged\nwhen interpreting the data; the small sample size and in￾herent limitations regarding the generalisability of quali￾tative data at a population level and the timing of\nrecruitment during the early stages of the DAA imple￾mentation in Australia could all affect the relevance of\nthis data to the current cohort of people seeking DAA\ntreatment. Study participants most likely represent early\nadopters of the DAAs, who sought out the treatment be￾cause they were well informed and motivated, compared\nto people currently accessing treatment who have pre￾ferred to wait and gather evidence of the DAA’s success.\nThe environment, in terms of the public’s and health\nworkforce’s awareness has most likely improved over time,\nmaking access to treatment less reliant on highly moti￾vated individuals. The focus of this study was on partici￾pants’ experiences of being cured, therefore, demographic\ninformation about participants’ age, mode of infection and\nliver disease staging were not systematically collected. The\nauthors acknowledge that these factors may influence peo￾ple’s experience of being cured of hepatitis C.\nMost participants in this study found DAAs easy to\ntake with generally mild and manageable side-effects.\nNonetheless they indicated it was important to acknow￾ledge the potential for DAA side effects, as this would\nenable people to plan and establish contingency plans\nfor the treatment course and support adherence. Overall,\nadherence to the DAAs was not an issue of concern, in\nthis study, participants described how they identified\ntheir own memory hooks and existing routines to sup￾port the daily administration of the DAAs [31]. However,\nthese participants were particularly motivated to achieve\na cure. In the future, more planning and support may be\nneeded to support adherence for people who are more\nsceptical about the DAAs and of their own need to\nachieve a cure.\nThe perspectives of participants who currently inject\ndrugs illustrates that the availability and effectiveness of\nDAAs are not the only factors that influence their\ndecision to start treatment, which is supported by\nGoutzamanis and colleagues (2016) [32]. Health promo￾tion messages need to shift the perceptions of current\ninjectors around treatment and re-treatment to ensure\nthey understand that DAAs are universally available and\npeople who currently inject are a priority population for\ntreatment access. In providing hepatitis C treatment and\ncare, clinicians, pharmacists and other service providers\nshould highlight the individual health benefits of\nre-treatment and the population level benefits of stop￾ping onward transmission. The issue of re-infection also\ndemonstrates the importance of promoting ongoing\nhepatitis C testing for current injectors and for continu￾ing investment in harm reduction programs including",
        "donation rates, or Brazil, a widely cited example of an\nunsuccessful law change to presumed consent. The\nsmall number of studies identified may be the result of\nour searchesfailing to identify all relevant publications,\nsuch evaluations not being performed, or the findings\nof evaluations not being publicly available. Others\nhave noted the difficulties in obtaining documentation\nabout the effects of national-level initiatives9 and the\nfact that strategic policies tend not to receive the same\nevaluative attention as, for example, medical\nprocedures.10\nThe available studies had methodological weak￾nesses. We evaluated three different types of research\nevidence—before and after studies, between country\ncomparisons using secondary data, and surveys.\nUnlike evaluations of medical interventions, the\n“hierarchy” of evidence is not clear when evaluating\na policy such as a change in legislation. The before and\nafter studies and the cross country comparisons each\nhave strengths and weaknesses. Before and after studies\nhave a quasi-experimental design and provide evi￾dence on the experience of individual countries, but\ntheir usefulness was limited by the small number of\ncountries covered and the lack of information about,\nand in-depth analysis of, any structural and contextual\nchanges during the same time period. Such changes\nmight have contributed to the increases in donation\nrates.\nThe studies comparing different countries per￾formed secondary analysis of data obtained from\ncountries with and without presumed consent legisla￾tion in place. They can show only associations between\nlegislation and organ donation rates, but they had the\nadvantage of exploring the impact of other important\nfactors such as mortality from road traffic accidents.\nEach study included explanatory factors based on what\nthe authors considered important, and these varied\nbetween studies, as didtheir relative importance.Other\nfactors likely to be important were not investigated. For\nexample, Catholicism was the only religion consid￾ered, despite the likely importance of other religions\nsuch as Islam and Judaism, which have been reported\nto have a negative impact on organ donation rates.11\nThe countries represented in the studies were mainly\nWestern European. Although this increases the like￾lihood that the findings are generalisable to the UK, it\nresulted in considerable overlap between the samples\nused. This duplication means that the studies are\nnaturally biased towards giving similar results.\nAlthough presumed consent is not a binary variable,\nit has been treated as such in the between country\ncomparisons. Countries vary in the nature of their\nlegislation and how the legislation is interpreted. Of\nkey importance is the extent of consultation about\ndonation with relatives of the deceased. This was partly\naddressed in one study that compared countries on the\nbasis of how legislation was implemented in practice,\nrather than the actual legislation in place.w8 Regardless\nof the legislative system, the procedures for contact\nwith relatives of newly deceased people are likely to be\nimportant determinants in whether consent is given.\nThe surveys provided useful information about\npublic attitudes to presumed consent, but important\nmethodological detail was not available in four of the\nsurveys and caution is needed in the interpretation of\nthe findings. There was also little exploration of\npotential differences across sociodemographic groups.\nIn addition, attitudes alone are unlikely to be a reliable\npredictor of behaviour. This is already reflected in the\ngap between high levels of support for organ donation\nin UK surveys and lower rates of registration on the\norgan donor register.\nConclusions\nThe available evidence suggeststhat presumed consent\nis associated with increased organ donation rates, even\nwhen other factors are accounted for. However, it\ncannot be inferred from this that the introduction of\npresumed consent legislation per se will lead to an",

Similarly, adopting conservative priors \ncan substantially reduce the likelihood of claiming that \nan effect exists when in fact it does not85. At present, \nsignificance testing remains the dominant framework \nwithin neuroscience, but the flexibility of alternative (for \nexample, Bayesian) approaches means that they should \nbe taken seriously by the field.\nConclusions and future directions\nA consequence of the remarkable growth in neurosci￾ence over the past 50 years has been that the effects we \nnow seek in our experiments are often smaller and more \nsubtle than before as opposed to when mostly easily dis￾cernible ‘low-hanging fruit’ were targeted. At the same \ntime, computational analysis of very large datasets is now \nrelatively straightforward, so that an enormous number of \ntests can be run in a short time on the same dataset. These \ndramatic advances in the flexibility of research design and \nanalysis have occurred without accompanying changes to \nother aspects of research design, particularly power. For \nexample, the average sample size has not changed sub￾stantially over time88 despite the fact that neuroscientists \nare likely to be pursuing smaller effects. The increase in \nresearch flexibility and the complexity of study designs89\ncombined with the stability of sample size and search for \nincreasingly subtle effects has a disquieting consequence: \na dramatic increase in the likelihood that statistically sig￾nificant findings are spurious. This may be at the root of \nthe recent replication failures in the preclinical literature8\nand the correspondingly poor translation of these findings \ninto humans90.\nLow power is a problem in practice because of the \nnormative publishing standards for producing novel, \nsignificant, clean results and the ubiquity of null \nhypothesis significance testing as the means of evaluat￾ing the truth of research findings. As we have shown, \nthese factors result in biases that are exacerbated by low \npower. Ultimately, these biases reduce the reproducibil￾ity of neuroscience findings and negatively affect the \nvalidity of the accumulated findings. Unfortunately, \npublishing and reporting practices are unlikely to \nchange rapidly. Nonetheless, existing scientific practices \ncan be improved with small changes or additions that \napproximate key features of the idealized model4,91,92. \nWe provide a summary of recommendations for future \nresearch practice in BOX 2.\nIncreasing disclosure. False positives occur more fre￾quently and go unnoticed when degrees of freedom in \ndata analysis and reporting are undisclosed5\n. Researchers \ncan improve confidence in published reports by noting \nin the text: “We report how we determined our sample \nsize, all data exclusions, all data manipulations, and all \nmeasures in the study.”7\n When such a statement is not \npossible, disclosure of the rationale and justification of \ndeviations from what should be common practice (that \nis, reporting sample size, data exclusions, manipula￾tions and measures) will improve readers’ understand￾ing and interpretation of the reported effects and, \ntherefore, of what level of confidence in the reported \neffects is appropriate. In clinical trials, there is an \nincreasing requirement to adhere to the Consolidated \nStandards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT), and the \nsame is true for systematic reviews and meta-analyses, \nfor which the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic \nReviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines are \nnow being adopted. A number of reporting guidelines \nhave been produced for application to diverse study \ndesigns and tools, and an updated list is maintained \nby the EQUATOR Network93.

        "ANNALS OF FAMILY MEDICINE ✦ WWW.ANNFAMMED.ORG ✦ VOL. 4, NO. 4 ✦ JULY/AUGUST 2006\n325\nCHRONIC CARE MODEL IMPLEMENTATION\nallowed the medical group to successfully tailor its own \napproach to advanced access implementation (Table 3). \nEfforts to improve the quality of medical practice \nhave a long history, going back at least to the work of \nDr Ernest Codman in the 19th century.17 More recently, \nwe passed through the phase of quality assurance based \non the “bad apple” theory, and then to the continuous \nquality improvement model from industry.18 After some \nfalse starts in which there was too much emphasis on \nimproving particular processes using models that took \ntoo long and failed to involve leadership and address \nculture, we now seem to be developing more com￾prehensive and rapid approaches that include physi￾cians.19 The research literature, however, has continued \nto focus almost entirely on studying interventions \nto change the behavior of individual physicians.20,21\nOnly recently are the 2 threads coming together in an \nunderstanding that real change requires applying qual￾ity improvement to change practice systems and using \norganizational change processes to do so.22-28\nSome of the lessons we draw from this large orga￾nization’s effort to transform its care for patients with \nchronic conditions are as follows:\n1. Choose selective care processes that have been well \nworked out in similar settings, or devote time to careful \ndesign and piloting before tackling implementation.\n2. Use the CCM as a backdrop for leaders to under￾stand the relationships and roles of specifi c care changes \nneeded, not as the change blueprint or training model.\n3. Recognize and respect the diffi culty of changing \ntraditional care patterns. Organizational and professional \ncultures are critical to any change and require as much \nattention as the implementation, so fi rst understand and \nalign your organization’s culture with the strategies being \nchosen.29 Attend to work relationships; when functioning \nwell, they should engage and empower all stakeholders \nto invest in and contribute to the changes.30\n4. Involve and engage physicians in both the care \nand change processes, or change will be stymied and \nthe impact on patient outcomes will be limited.\n5. Give individual clinics clear models and speci￾fi cations about the desired end, as well as latitude in \nhow they get there.\n6. Provide strong leadership vision, along with \nchange management skills, and ample resources at the \nlevel of both overall organization and individual clinics.\n7. Monitor closely what is going on, and adjust as \nchange barriers emerge. \n8. Focus, focus, focus! Large changes require strong \nprioritization and ongoing concentration of organiza￾tional attention, resources, time, and energies.\n9. Change takes time, probably twice as long as you \nthink. Pace the work, giving time and space for essen￾tial group learning and refl ection.31\n10. Allow for the unexpected. Complexity science \nsuggests that surprise is inherent in organizational \nchange, offering as much opportunity for learning and \ncreativity as threat of failure for those open to it.32,33\n11. Appreciate that concurrent organizational \nchanges may be unavoidable, even when it would be \nbetter to separate them.\nThis study is limited in being observational and \nincluding only a few clinics with varying change suc￾cess within one large care system. Interviews and clinic \nobservations were made at single points in a much \nlonger time span of changes. In addition, although the \noverall change effort was intended as implementation of \nthe CCM, it largely focused on the elements of delivery \nsystem design (PPTs) and on clinical information system \nchanges (EMR). This medical group’s experience may be \nbest viewed as an exploration in organizational change. \nStudy credibility is enhanced by the research team’s \nextensive experience in studying clinical practices and",
        "Both Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May \nhave recently expressed their support \nfor a change to the law in England to \nintroduce an opting-out system for organ \ndonation, and the Department of Health \nis consulting on the issue. This is based \non the assumption that it would make \na significant impact on the shortage of \norgans for transplantation and thus save \nhundreds of lives each year. It is a popular \nassumption, because the intention is so \nobviously well meaning. Sadly, though, it is \nan assumption that offers false hope.\nWOULD A CHANGE IN THE LAW \nINCREASE DECEASED DONATION?\nThere is no good evidence from anywhere \nin the world that a change in the law \nleads to a sustained increase in donation. \nIndeed, there are countries where in fact \ndonation has decreased, and Brazil offers \nperhaps the best example of this. The few \npublications that suggest a possible benefit \nhave important methodological flaws that \nmake it very difficult to isolate the impact \nof the law.1\n The evidence was reviewed in \ngreat detail as part of the second Organ \nDonation Taskforce report in 2008,2\n and \nlittle has changed since then. So what is \nthe basis for the assumption? There are at \nleast two important misunderstandings in \nthe case that are often made. First, there \nis the superficially attractive observation \nof the Spanish donation experience. Spain \nhas opting-out legislation and for many \nyears has had the highest donation rate in \nthe world. But the Spanish authorities have \nstated repeatedly that their ‘success’ does \nnot stem from the law.3\n Opting out was \nintroduced in Spain in 1979, with no apparent \neffect. Ten years later, in 1989, a national \ntransplant organisation was established \nwith a wide-ranging brief to transform the \ndonation system, based primarily on the \nemployment of medically qualified donor \ncoordinators in every hospital. The effects \nwere immediate, and Spain has led the way \nsince then. The Spanish model has been \nintroduced successfully in other regions and \ncountries, including northern Italy, Croatia, \nand Portugal. There were no changes in the \nlaw, but there were dramatic increases in \norgan donation as a result of nationally led \nchanges in clinical practice in intensive care \nunits (ICUs). Moreover, Spain does not in \nfact operate an opting-out system — there \nis no register for people to either opt in or \nopt out. As in England, consent for donation \nis explicit and comes either from the patient \nin life or through their family. \nThere is one other important factor \nrelevant to the Spanish success: different \ncountries have different numbers of \npotential donors. Very few patients die in \ncircumstances that allow organ donation \nto proceed (about one in a 100 in the \nUK). For clinical and practical reasons the \npatient must die from the ‘right’ diseases \n(that is, be free of transmissible agents \nsuch as cancer and significant infections), \nin the ‘right’ place (that is, in hospital \nand probably in an ICU), and in the ‘right’ \nway (that is, death must be, at least to \nsome extent, expected and predictable). \nMost donors have suffered a catastrophic \nbrain injury from intracerebral bleeding, \ntrauma, or hypoxia, and have been treated \nin intensive care. For many years Spain has \nhad between two and three times as many \nICU beds per capita compared with the UK. \nDifferent resources and approaches to end￾of-life care result in different numbers of \npotential donors — and therefore of actual \ndonors.\nSecond, a common misunderstanding \nis that under current opt-in legislation ‘in \norder to be a donor you have to have opted \nin, by joining the NHS Organ Donor Register \n(ODR)’. Because only 36% of the population \nhave signed up there is a false belief that \nthe other 64% will never be donors, because \nthey haven’t opted in. In fact, in the UK last \nyear the families of almost all brain dead \npotential donors were approached about \ndonation,4\n regardless of whether the patient",
        "kinds of things. We just kind of said, “No! No, that’s\nnot the way it works.” And to some extent that\nworked. But they still control the purse strings and as\nsuch they still have a lot of kind of ‘leverage over’ –\nbecause they can always say, if you’re not going to\nbehave the way we want you to, we’ll find another\nagency that will.\nImportantly, funding arrangements varied in terms of\nhow professional time could be flexibly deployed, for in￾stance, for patient care, team meetings and collaborative\ncase management. Revisioning the use of time was a\ncritical strategy.\n3. Revision use of time to meet the needs of client\npopulations\nTime and its use are crucial considerations, in terms of\nexpectations regarding ‘how long’ it should take to see\nhealth improvements, and how providers use time. Work￾ing with populations whose health is so closely linked with\nsocial and economic conditions can seem slow or stagnant\nwith respect to improvements in short- and long-term out￾comes. Rather than constructing patients as ‘non￾compliant’ or as failing to achieve goals, the Centre’s\nproviders recognized how broader contexts influenced\npeople’s health trajectories and decisions. The collective\nexpertise of staff and interdisciplinary teams was used to\ndetermine when to support or ‘push’ patients to go a step\nfurther in moving toward their potential. This was\nparticularly evident in relation to substance use and\naddictions issues, adhering to anti-retroviral treatments,\nsafe-guarding against interpersonal violence, or working\ntoward healthy parenting skills. Staff sought patient’s\ninput about goals, discerning the patients’ readiness and\nsupporting steps to prepare for change – a process\nthat required long-term strategies and commitment.\nA patient described the impact of not “approaching\nme too fast”:\nWhat this place did for me was, actually, it really did\nhelp me out. Because it gave me a sense of security, a\nsense of trust with these people. And for me that’s a\nhard thing to do, just to trust people. Especially\nmanagers and staff members of any type....And staff\nmembers don’t approach me too fast, too hard and too\nquick, which is important, I believe. So, it’s, let me sort\nof come to you. And because it’s hard for me to ask for\nthings...it’s hard for me to ask for help. So the staff\nhere are patient with that. And I think they understand\nthat, which is important.\nRevisioning the use of time also refers to cultivating\nhealth care relationships over time. Time is required for\nparticipatory engagement of patients, and is fostered by\nadopting clinic structures that encourage ‘patient activa￾tion’, such as patient-initiated appointments scheduled\non a drop-in or pre-booked basis. Such scheduling struc￾tures need to be creative, fluid, and innovative to accom￾modate people’s rapidly shifting priorities and concerns,\nas this provider explained:\nSo someone might come in and you think that they\nare going to be here for their ear infection. But then,\nyou get to know them on a broader level, so you can\nsay like, \"how are things going at home?” And to\nreally be able to see people in an ongoing way, and\nsay like, \"so where are you living now? And you know\nand how’s it going?\"... So then you can have the\nopportunity and the time and the resources to address\nthose issues.\nRevisioning time also means recognizing the com￾plexity of the work involved in providing PHC to mar￾ginalized populations. Organizationally, this required\nrecog nizing the need (and scheduling time) for inter￾disciplinary meetings; putting in place adequate time\nand processes to support staff to provide care to people\nwho are highly traumatized; and providing flexibility in\nscheduling so that patients with greater needs are\nprovided more time. This strategy in turn requires\ncollaborative decision-making.\n4. Engage in decision-making on the basis of critical\nanalyses of power differentials, flattened hierarchies\nwithin interdisciplinary teams, and shared leadership\napproaches",

        "for the old and frail has much more \nto do with helping to preserve their \ndignity, treating them with affection, \nand supporting their continued \ninvolvement in social activities, rather \nthan the pursuit of ever-more elusive \ncures. Politicians have a responsibility, \nalongside doctors and many others, to \nmake such care available, and this in \nitself will be an important part of the \nway forward. \nThe huge amount of money \nthat can be made from preventive \ntechnologies has diminished the \neconomic importance of treatment \ntechnologies, particularly for those \nillnesses that primarily affect poorer \npeople in poorer countries [18]. This \nhas meant a shift of attention from \nthe sick to the well and from the poor \nto the rich [19]. This effect of global \nmarkets requires a response in the \nform of an assertion of global human \nsolidarity. Health inequalities matter \nglobally as well as locally. A way forward \nmight be through taxation or other \nmeans, to make the sale of preventive \ntechnologies in countries with above￾average expectation of life conditional \non the availability of treatment for \nthose diseases that cause the most \ncatastrophic shortening of life in poor \ncountries. \n Conclusion\nHuman societies are riven by the effects \nof greed and fear. The rise of preventive \nhealth technologies has opened up \na new arena of human greed, which \nresponds to an enduring fear. The \ngreed is for ever-greater longevity; the \nfear is that of dying. The irony and the \ntragedy is that the greed infl ates the \nfear and poisons the present in the \nname of a better, or at least a longer, \nfuture. Ultimately, the only way of \ncombating disease mongering is to \nvalue the manner of our living above \nthe timing of our dying. \u0001 \nDOI: 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030146.g002 \n Figure 2.

We expect that these re￾sults will prompt our health care organizations to use\nthese data, and also apply a similar procedure to the one\ncurrently described to take decisions on drug coverage.\nImplementation of such procedure would help to estab￾lish appropriate priorities to allocate economic resources\nbased on objective evidence.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that JEC, JFE, JJG and LG have no competing interests,\nwhile EA and MW are employees of Bristol Myers Squibb.\nAuthors' contributions\nJJG conceived the study and coordinated the project.
