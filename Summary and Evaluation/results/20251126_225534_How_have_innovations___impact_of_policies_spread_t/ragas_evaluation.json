                "DAAs is not a sustainable response. There are many\nworkforce development projects underway in Australia,\nthat aim to build the capacity of primary care practitioners\nand ensure that people with hepatitis C have multiple\naccess points to DAA treatment; these programs need to\nbe sustained overtime.\nFuture promotion of the next wave of DAA candidates\nin Australia should draw on the firsthand experiences of\npeople who have been through the DAA treatment and\nhave achieved cure, including people who currently in\ufffeject drugs. Roger\u2019s \u2018Diffusion of Innovations\u2019 theory seeks\nto explain how, why, and at what rate new innovations\n(ideas, technology and/or products) gain momentum\nand diffuse or spread through a specific population.\nThis theory suggests that when an innovation, in this\ncase, DAAs, are promoted by respected individuals\nwithin a social network, it creates a desire to adopt\nthe innovation [26]. This perspective is supported by\nresearch that shows that people with hepatitis C have\nplayed an important role in engaging people who inject\ndrugs with hepatitis C in treatment services [27\u201330].\nThe limitations of this study should be acknowledged\nwhen interpreting the data; the small sample size and in\ufffeherent limitations regarding the generalisability of quali\ufffetative data at a population level and the timing of\nrecruitment during the early stages of the DAA imple\ufffementation in Australia could all affect the relevance of\nthis data to the current cohort of people seeking DAA\ntreatment. Study participants most likely represent early\nadopters of the DAAs, who sought out the treatment be\ufffecause they were well informed and motivated, compared\nto people currently accessing treatment who have pre\ufffeferred to wait and gather evidence of the DAA\u2019s success.\nThe environment, in terms of the public\u2019s and health\nworkforce\u2019s awareness has most likely improved over time,\nmaking access to treatment less reliant on highly moti\ufffevated individuals. The focus of this study was on partici\ufffepants\u2019 experiences of being cured, therefore, demographic\ninformation about participants\u2019 age, mode of infection and\nliver disease staging were not systematically collected. The\nauthors acknowledge that these factors may influence peo\ufffeple\u2019s experience of being cured of hepatitis C.\nMost participants in this study found DAAs easy to\ntake with generally mild and manageable side-effects.\nNonetheless they indicated it was important to acknow\ufffeledge the potential for DAA side effects, as this would\nenable people to plan and establish contingency plans\nfor the treatment course and support adherence. Overall,\nadherence to the DAAs was not an issue of concern, in\nthis study, participants described how they identified\ntheir own memory hooks and existing routines to sup\ufffeport the daily administration of the DAAs [31]. However,\nthese participants were particularly motivated to achieve\na cure. In the future, more planning and support may be\nneeded to support adherence for people who are more\nsceptical about the DAAs and of their own need to\nachieve a cure.\nThe perspectives of participants who currently inject\ndrugs illustrates that the availability and effectiveness of\nDAAs are not the only factors that influence their\ndecision to start treatment, which is supported by\nGoutzamanis and colleagues (2016) [32]. Health promo\ufffetion messages need to shift the perceptions of current\ninjectors around treatment and re-treatment to ensure\nthey understand that DAAs are universally available and\npeople who currently inject are a priority population for\ntreatment access. In providing hepatitis C treatment and\ncare, clinicians, pharmacists and other service providers\nshould highlight the individual health benefits of\nre-treatment and the population level benefits of stop\ufffeping onward transmission. The issue of re-infection also\ndemonstrates the importance of promoting ongoing\nhepatitis C testing for current injectors and for continu\ufffeing investment in harm reduction programs including",

The\nsmall number of studies identified may be the result of\nour searchesfailing to identify all relevant publications,\nsuch evaluations not being performed, or the findings\nof evaluations not being publicly available. Others\nhave noted the difficulties in obtaining documentation\nabout the effects of national-level initiatives9 and the\nfact that strategic policies tend not to receive the same\nevaluative attention as, for example, medical\nprocedures.10\nThe available studies had methodological weak\ufffenesses. We evaluated three different types of research\nevidence\u2014before and after studies, between country\ncomparisons using secondary data, and surveys.\nUnlike evaluations of medical interventions, the\n\u201chierarchy\u201d of evidence is not clear when evaluating\na policy such as a change in legislation. The before and\nafter studies and the cross country comparisons each\nhave strengths and weaknesses. Before and after studies\nhave a quasi-experimental design and provide evi\ufffedence on the experience of individual countries, but\ntheir usefulness was limited by the small number of\ncountries covered and the lack of information about,\nand in-depth analysis of, any structural and contextual\nchanges during the same time period. Such changes\nmight have contributed to the increases in donation\nrates.\nThe studies comparing different countries per\ufffeformed secondary analysis of data obtained from\ncountries with and without presumed consent legisla\ufffetion in place. They can show only associations between\nlegislation and organ donation rates, but they had the\nadvantage of exploring the impact of other important\nfactors such as mortality from road traffic accidents.\nEach study included explanatory factors based on what\nthe authors considered important, and these varied\nbetween studies, as didtheir relative importance.Other\nfactors likely to be important were not investigated. For\nexample, Catholicism was the only religion consid\ufffeered, despite the likely importance of other religions\nsuch as Islam and Judaism, which have been reported\nto have a negative impact on organ donation rates.11\nThe countries represented in the studies were mainly\nWestern European. Although this increases the like\ufffelihood that the findings are generalisable to the UK, it\nresulted in considerable overlap between the samples\nused. This duplication means that the studies are\nnaturally biased towards giving similar results.\nAlthough presumed consent is not a binary variable,\nit has been treated as such in the between country\ncomparisons. Countries vary in the nature of their\nlegislation and how the legislation is interpreted. Of\nkey importance is the extent of consultation about\ndonation with relatives of the deceased. This was partly\naddressed in one study that compared countries on the\nbasis of how legislation was implemented in practice,\nrather than the actual legislation in place.w8 Regardless\nof the legislative system, the procedures for contact\nwith relatives of newly deceased people are likely to be\nimportant determinants in whether consent is given.\nThe surveys provided useful information about\npublic attitudes to presumed consent, but important\nmethodological detail was not available in four of the\nsurveys and caution is needed in the interpretation of\nthe findings. There was also little exploration of\npotential differences across sociodemographic groups.\nIn addition, attitudes alone are unlikely to be a reliable\npredictor of behaviour. This is already reflected in the\ngap between high levels of support for organ donation\nin UK surveys and lower rates of registration on the\norgan donor register.\nConclusions\nThe available evidence suggeststhat presumed consent\nis associated with increased organ donation rates, even\nwhen other factors are accounted for. However, it\ncannot be inferred from this that the introduction of\npresumed consent legislation per se will lead to an",

Similarly, adopting conservative priors \ncan substantially reduce the likelihood of claiming that \nan effect exists when in fact it does not85. At present, \nsignificance testing remains the dominant framework \nwithin neuroscience, but the flexibility of alternative (for \nexample, Bayesian) approaches means that they should \nbe taken seriously by the\u00a0field.\nConclusions and future directions\nA consequence of the remarkable growth in neurosci\ufffeence over the past 50\u00a0years has been that the effects we \nnow seek in our experiments are often smaller and more \nsubtle than before as opposed to when mostly easily dis\ufffecernible \u2018low-hanging fruit\u2019 were targeted. At the same \ntime, computational analysis of very large datasets is now \nrelatively straightforward, so that an enormous number of \ntests can be run in a short time on the same dataset. These \ndramatic advances in the flexibility of research design and \nanalysis have occurred without accompanying changes to \nother aspects of research design, particularly power. For \nexample, the average sample size has not changed sub\ufffestantially over time88 despite the fact that neuroscientists \nare likely to be pursuing smaller effects. The increase in \nresearch flexibility and the complexity of study designs89\ncombined with the stability of sample size and search for \nincreasingly subtle effects has a disquieting consequence: \na dramatic increase in the likelihood that statistically sig\ufffenificant findings are spurious. This may be at the root of \nthe recent replication failures in the preclinical literature8\nand the correspondingly poor translation of these findings \ninto humans90.\nLow power is a problem in practice because of the \nnormative publishing standards for producing novel, \nsignificant, clean results and the ubiquity of null \nhypothesis significance testing as the means of evaluat\ufffeing the truth of research findings. As we have shown, \nthese factors result in biases that are exacerbated by low \npower. Ultimately, these biases reduce the reproducibil\ufffeity of neuroscience findings and negatively affect the \nvalidity of the accumulated findings. Unfortunately, \npublishing and reporting practices are unlikely to \nchange rapidly. Nonetheless, existing scientific practices \ncan be improved with small changes or additions that \napproximate key features of the idealized model4,91,92. \nWe provide a summary of recommendations for future \nresearch practice in BOX\u00a02.\nIncreasing disclosure.

Choose selective care processes that have been well \nworked out in similar settings, or devote time to careful \ndesign and piloting before tackling implementation.\n2. Use the CCM as a backdrop for leaders to under\ufffestand the relationships and roles of specifi c care changes \nneeded, not as the change blueprint or training model.\n3. Recognize and respect the diffi culty of changing \ntraditional care patterns. Organizational and professional \ncultures are critical to any change and require as much \nattention as the implementation, so fi rst understand and \nalign your organization\u2019s culture with the strategies being \nchosen.29 Attend to work relationships; when functioning \nwell, they should engage and empower all stakeholders \nto invest in and contribute to the changes.30\n4. Involve and engage physicians in both the care \nand change processes, or change will be stymied and \nthe impact on patient outcomes will be limited.\n5. Give individual clinics clear models and speci\ufffefi cations about the desired end, as well as latitude in \nhow they get there.\n6. Provide strong leadership vision, along with \nchange management skills, and ample resources at the \nlevel of both overall organization and individual clinics.\n7. Monitor closely what is going on, and adjust as \nchange barriers emerge. \n8. Focus, focus, focus! Large changes require strong \nprioritization and ongoing concentration of organiza\ufffetional attention, resources, time, and energies.\n9. Change takes time, probably twice as long as you \nthink. Pace the work, giving time and space for essen\ufffetial group learning and refl ection.31\n10. Allow for the unexpected. Complexity science \nsuggests that surprise is inherent in organizational \nchange, offering as much opportunity for learning and \ncreativity as threat of failure for those open to it.32,33\n11. Appreciate that concurrent organizational \nchanges may be unavoidable, even when it would be \nbetter to separate them.\nThis study is limited in being observational and \nincluding only a few clinics with varying change suc\ufffecess within one large care system. Interviews and clinic \nobservations were made at single points in a much \nlonger time span of changes. In addition, although the \noverall change effort was intended as implementation of \nthe CCM, it largely focused on the elements of delivery \nsystem design (PPTs) and on clinical information system \nchanges (EMR). This medical group\u2019s experience may be \nbest viewed as an exploration in organizational change. \nStudy credibility is enhanced by the research team\u2019s \nextensive experience in studying clinical practices and",
                "Both Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May \nhave recently expressed their support \nfor a change to the law in England to \nintroduce an opting-out system for organ \ndonation, and the Department of Health \nis consulting on the issue. This is based \non the assumption that it would make \na significant impact on the shortage of \norgans for transplantation and thus save \nhundreds of lives each year. It is a popular \nassumption, because the intention is so \nobviously well meaning. Sadly, though, it is \nan assumption that offers false hope.\nWOULD A CHANGE IN THE LAW \nINCREASE DECEASED DONATION?\nThere is no good evidence from anywhere \nin the world that a change in the law \nleads to a sustained increase in donation. \nIndeed, there are countries where in fact \ndonation has decreased, and Brazil offers \nperhaps the best example of this. The few \npublications that suggest a possible benefit \nhave important methodological flaws that \nmake it very difficult to isolate the impact \nof the law.1\n The evidence was reviewed in \ngreat detail as part of the second Organ \nDonation Taskforce report in 2008,2\n and \nlittle has changed since then. So what is \nthe basis for the assumption? There are at \nleast two important misunderstandings in \nthe case that are often made. First, there \nis the superficially attractive observation \nof the Spanish donation experience. Spain \nhas opting-out legislation and for many \nyears has had the highest donation rate in \nthe world. But the Spanish authorities have \nstated repeatedly that their \u2018success\u2019 does \nnot stem from the law.3\n Opting out was \nintroduced in Spain in 1979, with no apparent \neffect. Ten years later, in 1989, a national \ntransplant organisation was established \nwith a wide-ranging brief to transform the \ndonation system, based primarily on the \nemployment of medically qualified donor \ncoordinators in every hospital. The effects \nwere immediate, and Spain has led the way \nsince then. The Spanish model has been \nintroduced successfully in other regions and \ncountries, including northern Italy, Croatia, \nand Portugal. There were no changes in the \nlaw, but there were dramatic increases in \norgan donation as a result of nationally led \nchanges in clinical practice in intensive care \nunits (ICUs). Moreover, Spain does not in \nfact operate an opting-out system \u2014 there \nis no register for people to either opt in or \nopt out. As in England, consent for donation \nis explicit and comes either from the patient \nin life or through their family. \nThere is one other important factor \nrelevant to the Spanish success: different \ncountries have different numbers of \npotential donors. Very few patients die in \ncircumstances that allow organ donation \nto proceed (about one in a 100 in the \nUK). For clinical and practical reasons the \npatient must die from the \u2018right\u2019 diseases \n(that is, be free of transmissible agents \nsuch as cancer and significant infections), \nin the \u2018right\u2019 place (that is, in hospital \nand probably in an ICU), and in the \u2018right\u2019 \nway (that is, death must be, at least to \nsome extent, expected and predictable). \nMost donors have suffered a catastrophic \nbrain injury from intracerebral bleeding, \ntrauma, or hypoxia, and have been treated \nin intensive care. For many years Spain has \nhad between two and three times as many \nICU beds per capita compared with the UK. \nDifferent resources and approaches to end\ufffeof-life care result in different numbers of \npotential donors \u2014 and therefore of actual \ndonors.\nSecond, a common misunderstanding \nis that under current opt-in legislation \u2018in \norder to be a donor you have to have opted \nin, by joining the NHS Organ Donor Register \n(ODR)\u2019. Because only 36% of the population \nhave signed up there is a false belief that \nthe other 64% will never be donors, because \nthey haven\u2019t opted in. In fact, in the UK last \nyear the families of almost all brain dead \npotential donors were approached about \ndonation,4\n regardless of whether the patient",

But they still control the purse strings and as\nsuch they still have a lot of kind of \u2018leverage over\u2019 \u2013\nbecause they can always say, if you\u2019re not going to\nbehave the way we want you to, we\u2019ll find another\nagency that will.\nImportantly, funding arrangements varied in terms of\nhow professional time could be flexibly deployed, for in\ufffestance, for patient care, team meetings and collaborative\ncase management. Revisioning the use of time was a\ncritical strategy.\n3. Revision use of time to meet the needs of client\npopulations\nTime and its use are crucial considerations, in terms of\nexpectations regarding \u2018how long\u2019 it should take to see\nhealth improvements, and how providers use time. Work\ufffeing with populations whose health is so closely linked with\nsocial and economic conditions can seem slow or stagnant\nwith respect to improvements in short- and long-term out\ufffecomes. Rather than constructing patients as \u2018non\ufffecompliant\u2019 or as failing to achieve goals, the Centre\u2019s\nproviders recognized how broader contexts influenced\npeople\u2019s health trajectories and decisions. The collective\nexpertise of staff and interdisciplinary teams was used to\ndetermine when to support or \u2018push\u2019 patients to go a step\nfurther in moving toward their potential. This was\nparticularly evident in relation to substance use and\naddictions issues, adhering to anti-retroviral treatments,\nsafe-guarding against interpersonal violence, or working\ntoward healthy parenting skills. Staff sought patient\u2019s\ninput about goals, discerning the patients\u2019 readiness and\nsupporting steps to prepare for change \u2013 a process\nthat required long-term strategies and commitment.\nA patient described the impact of not \u201capproaching\nme too fast\u201d:\nWhat this place did for me was, actually, it really did\nhelp me out. Because it gave me a sense of security, a\nsense of trust with these people. And for me that\u2019s a\nhard thing to do, just to trust people. Especially\nmanagers and staff members of any type....And staff\nmembers don\u2019t approach me too fast, too hard and too\nquick, which is important, I believe. So, it\u2019s, let me sort\nof come to you. And because it\u2019s hard for me to ask for\nthings...it\u2019s hard for me to ask for help. So the staff\nhere are patient with that. And I think they understand\nthat, which is important.\nRevisioning the use of time also refers to cultivating\nhealth care relationships over time. Time is required for\nparticipatory engagement of patients, and is fostered by\nadopting clinic structures that encourage \u2018patient activa\ufffetion\u2019, such as patient-initiated appointments scheduled\non a drop-in or pre-booked basis. Such scheduling struc\ufffetures need to be creative, fluid, and innovative to accom\ufffemodate people\u2019s rapidly shifting priorities and concerns,\nas this provider explained:\nSo someone might come in and you think that they\nare going to be here for their ear infection. But then,\nyou get to know them on a broader level, so you can\nsay like, \"how are things going at home?\u201d And to\nreally be able to see people in an ongoing way, and\nsay like, \"so where are you living now? And you know\nand how\u2019s it going?\"... So then you can have the\nopportunity and the time and the resources to address\nthose issues.\nRevisioning time also means recognizing the com\ufffeplexity of the work involved in providing PHC to mar\ufffeginalized populations. Organizationally, this required\nrecog nizing the need (and scheduling time) for inter\ufffedisciplinary meetings; putting in place adequate time\nand processes to support staff to provide care to people\nwho are highly traumatized; and providing flexibility in\nscheduling so that patients with greater needs are\nprovided more time. This strategy in turn requires\ncollaborative decision-making.\n4. Engage in decision-making on the basis of critical\nanalyses of power differentials, flattened hierarchies\nwithin interdisciplinary teams, and shared leadership\napproaches",

                "for the old and frail has much more \nto do with helping to preserve their \ndignity, treating them with affection, \nand supporting their continued \ninvolvement in social activities, rather \nthan the pursuit of ever-more elusive \ncures. Politicians have a responsibility, \nalongside doctors and many others, to \nmake such care available, and this in \nitself will be an important part of the \nway forward. \nThe huge amount of money \nthat can be made from preventive \ntechnologies has diminished the \neconomic importance of treatment \ntechnologies, particularly for those \nillnesses that primarily affect poorer \npeople in poorer countries [18]. This \nhas meant a shift of attention from \nthe sick to the well and from the poor \nto the rich [19]. This effect of global \nmarkets requires a response in the \nform of an assertion of global human \nsolidarity. Health inequalities matter \nglobally as well as locally. A way forward \nmight be through taxation or other \nmeans, to make the sale of preventive \ntechnologies in countries with above\ufffeaverage expectation of life conditional \non the availability of treatment for \nthose diseases that cause the most \ncatastrophic shortening of life in poor \ncountries. \n Conclusion\nHuman societies are riven by the effects \nof greed and fear. The rise of preventive \nhealth technologies has opened up \na new arena of human greed, which \nresponds to an enduring fear. The \ngreed is for ever-greater longevity; the \nfear is that of dying. The irony and the \ntragedy is that the greed infl ates the \nfear and poisons the present in the \nname of a better, or at least a longer, \nfuture. Ultimately, the only way of \ncombating disease mongering is to \nvalue the manner of our living above \nthe timing of our dying. \u0001 \nDOI: 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030146.g002 \n Figure 2. Risk Factors for Health Are Almost \nAlways Distributed across a Bell Curve\n Geoffrey Rose argued that more could be \nachieved by attempting to shift the whole of \nthe bell curve (the \u201cpopulation approach\u201d to \nprevention) than by targeting those at highest \nrisk (the \u201chigh-risk\u201d approach). \n (Image: Adapted from a fi gure by John \nEmberson from [8]) \nApril 2006 | Volume 3 | Issue 4 | e146\nReferences\n1.

We expect that these re\ufffesults will prompt our health care organizations to use\nthese data, and also apply a similar procedure to the one\ncurrently described to take decisions on drug coverage.\nImplementation of such procedure would help to estab\ufffelish appropriate priorities to allocate economic resources\nbased on objective evidence.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that JEC, JFE, JJG and LG have no competing interests,\nwhile EA and MW are employees of Bristol Myers Squibb.\nAuthors' contributions\nJJG conceived the study and coordinated the project.

            "response": "This article discusses several topics related to healthcare and medicine. Firstly, it presents a study that investigates the association between organ donation rates and laws assuming presumed consent. The study compares countries with and without presumed consent legislation and finds that presumed consent is associated with higher organ donation rates, although other factors also play a role. Secondly, the article highlights the issue of re-infection among people who currently inject drugs and the need to promote ongoing hepatitis C testing and re-treatment. Thirdly, it touches upon the topic of publication bias in neuroscience research due to the dominance of significance testing and the flexibility of alternative approaches. Lastly, the article emphasizes the importance of addressing the complexities of study designs, sample sizes, and search for increasingly subtle effects in light of the growing body of preclinical literature failures and the correspondingly poor translation of these findings into humans. The article concludes by suggesting ways to combat disease mongering, such as making the sale of preventive technologies in countries with above-average expectation of life conditional on the availability of treatment for diseases causing the most catastrophic shortening of life in poor countries.\n\nIn terms of healthcare delivery, the article mentions a successful effort by a large healthcare organization to implement the Chronic Care Model (CCM) for managing patients with chronic conditions. The study recommends choosing selective care processes carefully, respecting cultural and work relationships, involving and engaging stakeholders, and attending to work relationships to maximize engagement and contribution to the changes. Additionally, the article proposes taxation or other means to make the sale of preventive technologies conditional on the availability of treatment for diseases causing the most catastrophic shortening of life in poor countries.\n\nOverall, the article covers various issues related to healthcare and medicine, ranging from organ donation rates, re-infection among people who currently inject drugs, publication bias in neuroscience research, healthcare delivery, and ways to combat disease mongering.",

Richmond1,2,3* , Jeanne Ellard4\n, Jack Wallace1,2, Rachel Thorpe1\n, Peter Higgs2,5, Margaret Hellard2,6,7\nand Alexander Thompson8,9\nAbstract\nBackground: Universal access to the hepatitis C direct acting antiviral (DAAs) regimens presents a unique\nopportunity to eliminate hepatitis C in Australia. Large numbers of Australians have already been cured using these\ntreatments, however, the numbers presenting for treatment have begun to plateau. This study explored how\npeople experienced and understood being cured of hepatitis C, with the aim of informing interventions to increase\nuptake of DAA treatment among people with hepatitis C.\nMethods: This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews to explore the experiences of people with hepatitis\nC taking DAAs accessing both hospital and community clinics. Interviews were conducted 12 weeks after treatment\ncompletion. Participants were asked to reflect on their experience of living with hepatitis C, their reasons for\nseeking treatment, and their experience of, DAA treatments. Participants were also asked to reflect on the meaning\nof being cured, and how they shared this experience with their peers. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and key\nthemes were identified using inductive thematic analysis.\nResults: Twenty participants were interviewed. While participants described a range of physical health benefits of\nachieving a hepatitis C cure it was an improved sense of psychological wellbeing that had the most significant\nimpact on participants\u2019 lives. The majority described their relief about no longer living with the burden of an\nuncertain future due to anxiety about developing liver disease or cancer, as well as fear of infecting others.\nParticipants who had a past history of injecting drug use, described being cured as a way to break the connection\nwith their past. Participants who were current injectors raised concerns about re-infection.\nConclusion: Feeling \u201cnormal\u201d and not infectious allows people to live with reduced psychological distress, in\naddition to the physical benefits of no longer being at risk of developing serious liver disease. Future engagement\nstrategies targeting people who are not accessing hepatitis health care need to promote the lived experience of\nbeing cured and the substantial psychological, and physical health benefits, offered by achieving a cure.\nInterventions aimed at people who are currently injecting also need to highlight the availability of re-treatment in\nconjunction with primary prevention strategies.\nKeywords: Hepatitis C, Cure, Qualitative, Lived experience\n* Correspondence: J.Richmond@latrobe.edu.au 1\nAustralian Research Centre in Sex, Health and Society, La Trobe University,\nBundoora, Victoria, Australia\n2\nDisease Elimination, The Burnet Institute, Prahran, Victoria, Australia\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nHepatology, \nand Policy\nMedicine\n\u00a9 The Author(s). 2018 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and\nreproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to\nthe Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

Hepatology, Medicine and Policy (2018) 3:8 \nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/s41124-018-0036-5\n\nBackground\nThe universal, government funded access to direct acting\nantiviral (DAA) treatments for hepatitis C in Australia\npresents a unique opportunity to eliminate hepatitis C.\nThe Australian Government [1], in line with the World\nHealth Organization (WHO) [2], has set the ambitious\ntarget of eliminating hepatitis C as a public health threat\nby 2030. During the first 15 months of access, an\nestimated 43,360 people initiated DAA treatment in\nAustralia [3]. However, an estimated 200,000 Australians\nremain infected with hepatitis C and data suggests the\nnumber of people presenting for treatment in Australia\nplateaued in 2017 [3]. The decline in number of people\naccessing DAA treatment compared to 2016 reflects the\nclearing the of the so called \u201ctreatment warehouse\u201d where\npatients were regularly engaging with clinical services\nwhile waiting for the DAAs, and highlights the importance\nof ongoing vigilance regarding testing and linkage to care.\nThe reason for the plateau in number of people presenting\nfor treatment is thought to be multifactorial: lack of know\ufffeledge about hepatitis C, [4, 5] the asymptomatic nature of\nthe disease and the negative perceptions of previous\ninterferon-based treatment mean that many people with\nhepatitis C do not prioritise the treatment [6]. Addition\ufffeally, the social marginalisation related to current or\npast injecting drug use and the stigma and discrimin\ufffeation associated with injecting drug use, have been\nshown to act as significant barriers to accessing hepa\ufffetitis C testing and treatment [7, 8].\nHepatitis C infection has been associated with multiple\nextrahepatic manifestations such as depression and\ndiabetes [9], which can have a profound impact on\nquality of life [10, 11]. The clinical impact of achiev\ufffeing a sustained virological response (SVR) measured\nat 12 weeks after treatment completion, and now\nreferred to as hepatitis C cure, [12] has been widely\nreported to reduce the risk of liver-related morbidity\nand mortality, [13, 14] and the risk of developing ex\ufffetrahepatic manifestations, [15\u201317] and is associated\nwith improved quality of life [18]. From the patients\u2019\nperspective cure of hepatitis C is associated with im\ufffeproved energy levels, reduced uncertainty about the\nfuture, a more positive outlook on life, and improved\npersonal relationships [19, 20].\nWhile the public health approach to hepatitis C treat\ufffement focuses on population level elimination, [12]\nunderstanding the impact of cure for individuals and\naffected communities and communicating these experi\ufffeences to people with hepatitis C and service providers is\ncentral in persuading others to access treatment services.\nThis qualitative study explores experiences of being\ncured of hepatitis C; the findings contribute new\nknowledge to inform interventions to promote access to\nhepatitis C treatment.\nMethods\nRecruitment\nEthics approval for this study was granted by the St\nVincent\u2019s Hospital Melbourne, Low and Negligible Risk\nHuman Research and Ethics Committee (LRR-209/15).\nParticipants were recruited through one Melbourne\nmetropolitan tertiary hospital-based liver clinic and three\naffiliated community-based clinics between October 2016\nand April 2017. The three community-based clinics were\nlocated in inner and northern metropolitan Melbourne\nand staffed by medical specialists and nurses employed by\nthe tertiary hospital to offer an outreach specialist service\nincluding access to hepatitis C testing, liver diseases as\ufffesessment and DAA treatment. Nursing staff from each\nclinic invited consecutive patients who had achieved an\nSVR, 12 weeks after treatment completion to contact the\nresearcher (JR), who provided a participant information\nstatement and consent form. If the individual decided to\nproceed, written informed consent was obtained prior to\nthe interview. Interviews were conducted by author JE\nand were conducted either face to face at the hospital\nliver clinic or on the phone. Interviews lasted\nbetween 20 and 45 min. Participants were offered a\n$AUD30 gift voucher after the interview.\nData collection\nSemi-structured interviews were conducted to explore\nthe experiences of people who achieved an SVR after\ntaking DAA treatment. Participants were asked to:\n\u0001 Identify the barriers and enablers to treatment\nsuccess from their perspective\n\u0001 Explore the meaning of \u2018cure\u2019\n\u0001 Describe the ways they shared knowledge and\nexperiences of treatment within their peer networks\n\u0001 Describe adherence strategies they used while taking\nthe DAAs.\nAnalysis\nInterviews were transcribed verbatim and imported and\ncoded in NVivo Pro, a qualitative data analysis computer\nsoftware package. A thematic analysis was undertaken\nby authors JR and RT to identify text relating to the key\nthemes associated with the research questions and\ninformed the development of a coding framework. New\nthemes identified after repeated close reading of the\ntranscripts were added to the coding framework. Memos\nwere used to record ideas about connections between\nthe themes and to the overarching concept of cure.\nResults\nParticipants\nTwenty participants were interviewed during the study,\nwith their characteristics presented in Table 1. Equal\nRichmond et al. Hepatology, Medicine and Policy (2018) 3:8 Page 2 of 9\n\nnumbers of men (n = 10) and women (n = 10) were inter\ufffeviewed. Twelve participants attended the tertiary hos\ufffepital liver clinic, with the remaining eight participants\nattending one of three community-based clinics. Partici\ufffepants reported being diagnosed with hepatitis C between\ntwo to twenty-seven years ago. Two participants reported\nbeing diagnosed with cirrhosis and a further two\nparticipants reported they had test results that indi\ufffecated severe liver disease. Seven participants had\ncompleted interferon-based therapy prior to this\ncourse of the DAAs. For the remaining 13 partici\ufffepants, this course of the DAAs was their first hepa\ufffetitis C treatment experience.\nThe meaning of achieving a \u2018hepatitis C cure\u2019\nPsychological impact\nParticipants discussed their understanding of being\ncured in several ways. The most frequently identified\noutcome of achieving a \u2018cure\u2019 was being relieved of the\npsychological burden of living with hepatitis C, and this\noutcome was often prioritised over that of physical\nsymptoms. Most participants reported experiencing few\nsymptoms prior to commencing treatment, and as such,\nwere often unaware of any physical burden of living with\nhepatitis C:\nIt hasn\u2019t changed my life that much because I never\nreally had any symptoms\u2026 The biggest change is\njust\u2026emotionally\u2026you go from being someone with a\nchronic disease that has the potential to cut your life\nshort to being free (Participant 18, female).\nThree participants were excited about not having to\nworry about their health and instead being able to plan\nfor their future and old age, with a more positive\noutlook:\nIt\u2019s like a real weight has just been lifted from you.\nI probably believed that one day it would get me\nbecause you just think oh, liver cancer, it\u2019s such an\ninsidious nasty thing. If you get that, you\u2019re buggered\n(Participant 5, female).\nReduced uncertainty and fear\nWhile some participants associated being cured with less\nuncertainty and fear about the future, others highlighted\nthat being cured allowed them to clarify the physical ef\ufffefects of hepatitis C infection, which reduced their uncer\ufffetainty related to their general health. Four participants\nnoted that while they lived with hepatitis C, they were\nnever sure whether to attribute illness or fatigue to their\nhepatitis C infection or another illness, or ageing. Since\nbeing cured, participants reported being more certain\nabout the cause of other physical conditions or illnesses:\nIt\u2019s hard to tell what it\u2019s actually doing to you and\nwhether the fatigue or ill health is related to it because\nit was never very clear what [hepatitis C] did to you\n(Participant 7, male).\nAnother participant described no longer worrying\nabout whether symptoms were underlying signs of a\nmore serious health condition:\nThe fact that that\u2019s not there anymore, like if I get sick\nor I\u2019m ill means all I\u2019ve got is that. I\u2019ve just got the \u2018flu\n... It\u2019s not that it\u2019s my liver\u2019s fricking packing up on me\nor something (Participant 5, female).\n\u201cFeeling normal\u201d\nThe experience of the cure also related to participants\nreporting they no longer felt infectious, particularly in\nthe context of their family or people they lived with.\nThis was often expressed in a marked shift in how they\nthought about themselves. For many the implied\nmeaning of feeling \u201cnormal\u201d was not being \u201cdirty\u201d or\n\u201cinfectious\u201d:\nTable 1 Characteristics of participants interviewed for the study\nTranscript Gender Year of\ndiagnosis\nPrevious Interferon\ufffebased treatment\nDAA Treatment\nlocation\n1 Female 2005 No Hospital\n2 Female 2001 No Community\n3 Female 2007 No Community\n4 Male 2007 No Community\n5 Female 1997 No Hospital\n6 Male 2003 No Community\n7 Male 1997 Yes Hospital\n8 Male 2002 Yes Hospital\n9 Female 2015 No Hospital\n10 Male 2002 No Hospital\n11 Female 2010 Yes Hospital\n12 Male 1997 No Hospital\n13 Male 2013 No Hospital\n14 Female 2001 Yes Community\n15 Female 2005 No Hospital\n16 Male 2010 No Community\n17 Female 2000 Yes Hospital\n18 Female 1990 Yes Hospital\n19 Female 2012 No Community\n20 Male 1990 Yes Community\nRichmond et al. Hepatology, Medicine and Policy (2018) 3:8 Page 3 of 9\n\nI feel normal again \u2026 I don\u2019t feel different to everyone\nelse (Participant 6, male).\nFor some, no longer being infectious meant they\ncould change their behaviour and personal interac\ufffetions because they did not have to worry about\ntransmission:\nAt my house, with toothbrushes and razors and\nstuff, it\u2019s been something that I\u2019ve had to be really,\nreally vigilant with, with children in the house and\nwith my partner \u2026 it\u2019s really nice to know that I\ndon\u2019t have that in me anymore, and there aren\u2019t\nthose risks there of passing it on to anyone else\n(Participant 6, male).\nHowever, one participant continued long term habits in\navoiding physical contact to prevent possible transmission:\nI\u2019ve got issues where I can\u2019t kiss anyone or I won\u2019t\nlet anyone take a drag of my cigarette\u2026I still\ncan\u2019t, because it\u2019s been years like I\u2019ve been\ndoing that, so I still can\u2019t stop doing that\n(Participant 2, female).\nOne participant discussed the impact of cure on their\ninteractions with health providers such as dentists and\npathology collectors:\nI love not being infectious\u2026That for me has probably\nbeen the biggest thing \u2013 not having to feel guilty every\ntime I had a blood test done that I might infect\nsomebody, going to the dentist is nowhere near as\nstressful (Participant 17, female).\nBreaking a connection to the past\nSeveral participants who contracted hepatitis C\nthrough sharing injecting equipment, and who no\nlonger injected, described a sense of guilt and shame\nabout their past injecting; feelings which persisted\nyears after they had stopped injecting. These partici\ufffepants explained that hepatitis C was an ongoing\nmarker of their injecting history and that being cured\nbroke that connection:\nIt\u2019s like the last mark \u2026 is now gone. All the rest is\njust memories that I don\u2019t have to think about\n(Participant 6, male).\nParticipants reflected on the ways being cured shifted\ntheir sense of self self-perception, and some felt that no\nlonger having the disease would enable a break with the\npast:\nIt does make me feel more normal in a community\nsense \u2026 that I don\u2019t have appointments or doctors are\ngoing to find out or my daughter\u2019s friends are going to\nfind out. That\u2019s very liberating (Participant 2, female).\nOthers expected they would continue to experience\nguilt in relation to their past drug use:\nI still feel guilty about it\u2026about having used drugs\nwhen I was younger, about having contracted the\nhepatitis C\u2026 It\u2019s just a bit of a mental scar that I\nsuppose I\u2019m going to carry for a long time\n(Participant 16, male).\nPhysical impact\nWhile many participants had not felt they had physical\nsymptoms before commencing treatment, some de\ufffescribed experiencing improved physical health as a result\nof being cured. Three participants explicitly attributed\ntheir improved physical health to being cured of hepa\ufffetitis C, while others were uncertain whether their per\ufffeception that their health had improved was directly\nrelated to hepatitis C or a result of the psychological\nbenefits that flowed from no longer living with the virus:\nI don\u2019t know how much of that is psychological. I don\u2019t\nthink it\u2019s all psychological. I\u2019m sure there is a physical\nelement \u2026 I have more energy, I am sleeping better,\njust a whole range of things (Participant 16, male).\nOne participant with hepatitis C-related liver damage\nnoted that even after being cured, she needed to\nundergo regular monitoring for liver disease. However,\nher concern about one day dying of liver disease was\nreduced:\nBecause I am cirrhotic I still have to have regular\nFibroScans and liver function tests. In some ways those\nthings haven\u2019t changed. I think it is just more that my\noutlook has changed (Participant 17, female).\nFor many participants the physical effects of living\nwith hepatitis C only became apparent post cure. For\nthose participants with significant liver damage, the on\ufffegoing need to monitor the liver for complications was a\nreminder of the physical damage inflicted by living with\nthe virus for a long time.\nAdherence strategies\nIn addition to exploring the impact and meaning\nascribed by participants to achieving a cure, the\ninterviews explored the experiences of taking the\nDAAs. Overall, participants reported that adherence\nRichmond et al. Hepatology, Medicine and Policy (2018) 3:8 Page 4 of 9\n\nto the DAAs was easy and unproblematic. One reason\ncited for the ease of adherence was a strong desire to\nbe hepatitis C free and a belief that inconsistent\nadherence to the treatment would affect their chance\nof being cured.\nI just made sure I did what the doctors recommended\nto beat this bloody thing (Participant 3, female).\nThe most common adherence strategy described by\nparticipants was taking the tablet(s) at the same time\nevery day, and either by establishing a new routine or fit\ufffeting the DAAs into an established routine. Participants\nwho were already taking daily medication commonly\ndiscussed incorporating the DAAs into this routine and\ntaking the DAAs at the same time as the other medica\ufffetion, most often in the morning:\nIn the morning with my contraceptive pill. As soon as I\nwake up \u2026 that\u2019s usually what I do, the pill, brush my\nteeth, shower (Participant 15, female).\nThose who were not already taking medication\ndiscussed incorporating the DAAs into other daily\nroutines:\nIt was straightforward for me and I think that\u2019s\nwhy it was good to do them at night. I had them\nby the bed and I\u2019d have a drink of water and I\u2019d\nplug my phone in \u2026 I built it into that kind of a\nroutine (Participant 5, female).\nOne participant, taking up to five DAA tablets a day,\nused a dosette box to support adherence while another\nused a calendar, and others mentioned checking each\ndose off on a chart that had come with the DAA pack\ufffeaging. Another who was not accustomed to taking daily\nmedication recalled finding it difficult to remember to\ntake the DAAs, and set a daily mobile phone alarm as a\nreminder.\nFourteen participants reported forgetting to take one\nor two doses, which in some cases made them feel\nextremely anxious as they were concerned it would\ninfluence the efficacy of the treatment. This episode\nmotivated those participants to take the tablets as soon\nas they remembered:\nA couple of days I thought, you know, at lunchtime,\noh, strewth, I haven\u2019t taken my pills. (Laughs)\u2026 no, no,\nno, no. And I mean, it was so important. I mean, my\nfuture sort of rode on it (Participant 18, female).\nOther participants checked with their doctors regard\ufffeing the recommended strategy for missed doses:\nI told the doctor and he said that\u2019d be fine as long as I\nmade sure that I kept everything, you know, spot on\nfrom then on, and I did (Participant 6, male).\nOverall, participants reported ease with adhering to\nthe DAA regimen and developed individual strategies to\nsupport their daily administration.\nBarriers and enablers to taking DAA treatment\nThe challenges associated with using DAA regimens\nrelated to individual circumstances, such as pharma\ufffeceutical management of existing medical conditions\nand lack of awareness among health professionals of\nthe DAAs. One participant discussed the need to\ncease taking existing medication to manage a mental\nhealth condition and this required closer monitoring\nwhile she was on the course of DAAs. Another par\ufffeticipant replaced one medication with another as her\nliver enzymes had risen.\nIn terms of side effects, one participant reported\nexperiencing high blood pressure from taking the DAAs,\nwhich caused side effects throughout the duration of the\ntreatment:\nI still didn\u2019t have an easy time because my specialist\ntold me it would lower my blood pressure and it\ndidn\u2019t. It made my blood pressure go higher \u2026 it\nwasn\u2019t fun for me at all (Participant 14, female).\nInexperience and lack of confidence amongst health\nprofessionals regarding DAAs and potential drug inter\ufffeactions was highlighted by several participants as a\npotential barrier to access. One participant identified\nthat their doctor was unwilling to prescribe the DAAs\ngiven their lack of knowledge:\nWhen I\u2019d decided and rocked up to my appointment\nto ask her about it and she told me that she wasn\u2019t\nprepared to prescribe because she hadn\u2019t got her head\naround it, that was just a huge blow\u2026if people aren\u2019t\neven prepared to prescribe it, well, why are we doing\nthis? (Participant 19, female).\nAnother participant was disappointed about their\ndoctor\u2019s lack of understanding about potential drug\ninteractions:\n[A Nurse] \u2026told me about this website from \u2026 a\nhospital that listed all the interactions of the hepatitis\nC drugs with existing drugs. I\u2019d gone right through that\nand checked what I was taking against all that and\nthat was how I realised that I shouldn\u2019t actually be\ntaking [the medication]. So I spoke to my GP about it\nand we sorted that out \u2026 It was really only the fact\nRichmond et al. Hepatology, Medicine and Policy (2018) 3:8 Page 5 of 9\n\nthat [the nurse] was so on the ball that we ended up\ngetting it sorted out (Participant 16, male).\nHowever, most participants reported being supported\nby health professionals during treatment. One partici\ufffepant, who was currently injecting drugs discussed\ndifficulties in treatment adherence as their life was \u201ca\nbit chaotic\u201d, and described how the health profes\ufffesionals in a community-based service supported\nadherence.\nAnother participant discussed that the anticipation of\nside effects was a barrier to their commencing treat\ufffement; the fear of potential side effects was worse than\nthe experience.\nI approached it with a degree of trepidation but as it\nturned out I just simply got stuck into it and had very\nminimal side-effects (Participant 5, female).\nMost participants were treated through specialist\nservices either in a tertiary hospital or in an outreach\nclinic in the community; only three participants were\nprescribed their DAA course by a General Practitioner\n(GP). As interviews were conducted at the beginning of\nthe implementation phase of the DAAs in Australia\nwhen few GPs were involved in prescribing DAAs and\nawareness raising activities had not officially com\ufffemenced, the experiences of participants with GPs may\nhave been be less than ideal.\nSharing knowledge with peers\nAll participants reflected on their positive experiences of\nthe treatment and being cured by recommending that\npeople with hepatitis C seek advice from their doctor\nabout taking DAAs:\nI have told a few people and other people have asked\nme \u2026 I recommend it (Participant 1, female).\nI\u2019m reasonably medically aware I suppose and\ncautious, but with that background I would urge\nanybody with hep C to very much be confident\nabout getting onto this drug to cure themselves\n(Participant 12, male).\nWhile all participants emphasised the positive aspects\nof being cured, some also thought that it was important\nto inform prospective patients of the potential side\neffects:\nThe only thing was that I really would be reluctant to\ntell people that these medications are side-effect free \u2026\nthere\u2019s a 2% chance that anyone would have the\nreaction I did (Participant 17, female).\nOne participant said that although they would like to\nshare their experiences of being cured with peers and the\nbroader community, they remained cautious about telling\npeople about their experience of living with hepatitis C\ngiven the stigma associated with contracting the virus\nthrough injecting drugs:\nOne part of me wants to sort of yell it at the top of my\nvoice and say, look, this is an amazing, miraculous\ncure out there. Please, anyone that\u2019s got hep C, go and\nget involved with it. But then the other part of me, sort\nof I suppose the conservative \u2013 but \u2026 I still feel guilty\nabout it (Participant 16, male).\nThere was a strong sense that the DAAs needed to be\ndistinguished from interferon-based treatments with\nparticipants emphasising the need to advertise that DAAs\nwere more effective and had fewer side effects than\ninterferon-based treatment, and were simple to take:\nI\u2019d tell them, no matter what your experience\nwith past drugs \u2026 this is totally different\n(Participant 18, female).\nThe two participants who identified as current inject\ufffeing drug users were positive about their treatment\nexperience and said they would encourage peers to seek\ntreatment. One participant shared her experiences\nformally as a peer educator:\nI\u2019d already started working as a peer educator, so\npart of that was an obligation to other users and\nneeding to know what I was trying to tell people\nand encourage people to do... if I\u2019m going to tell\nanother user to do something I want to at least\nhave experienced it, so I know what the hell I\u2019m\ntelling them (Participant 19, female).\nWhile the current injectors were positive about\ntaking the DAAs, they identified potential barriers fa\ufffecing other people who inject, including the potential\nfor re-infection. One participant was concerned that\nre-infection would become a new source of stigma:\nI think that there\u2019s also something to be said about the\nstigma and the guilt that goes along with re-infection.\nThat\u2019s a whole new monster that we\u2019re going to have to\ndeal with soon (Participant 19, female).\nThis same participant also proposed that some\ncurrent injectors would continue to hold off on treat\ufffement because they conceptualised treatment as some\ufffething to embark upon after they finished injecting\ndrugs:\nRichmond et al. Hepatology, Medicine and Policy (2018) 3:8 Page 6 of 9\n\nI am finding that just even talking to the community\non the street, it\u2019s just like - yeah, big deal, there\u2019s a\ntreatment, but I\u2019m not done with the life at the\nmoment here, you know. And they do see it as\nsomething to happen when they\u2019ve done with their\nusing life (Participant 19, female).\nDiscussion\nThere is no disputing the revolutionary impact the\nDAAs have had on the clinical management of hepatitis\nC. While most participants involved in the current study\nhad not experienced symptoms related to hepatitis C,\nthey described feeling lucky to have escaped the\ninfection relatively unscathed. Most significant was the\npsychological impact of being cured, highlighting the\nserious impact of hepatitis C and drug use\nrelated-stigma on the lived experience of people with\nhepatitis C and the uncertainty related to the physical\nimpact of living with the infection.\nParticipants no longer felt infectious or a threat to\ntheir families and friends in terms of onward transmis\ufffesion, and for several participants, the benefit of breaking\na link to previous drug use was transformative. This\nexperience is echoed by the findings of Harris (2017)\nwho describes hepatitis C treatment as promising social\nreconnection, social redemption from the drug using\npast and a return to \u2018normality\u2019 [21]. While most partici\ufffepants were not currently injecting drugs, the label of\n\u201cdrug user\u201d inferred by a diagnosis of hepatitis C was an\nimportant motivator to access treatment. Also, the relief\nof no longer needing to worry about the risk of illness or\ndeath because of an infection contracted during their\nyouth was immensely important.\nParticipants were passionate advocates for sharing the\nbenefits of being cured with people in their network and\ncomplete strangers. The unexpected result of feeling\n\u201cnormal\u201d because they were no longer infectious was\nhighlighted as an important message to communicate to\npeople not currently engaged in hepatitis C health care.\nThe psychological relief, in addition to the physical ben\ufffeefits of no longer being at risk of developing serious liver\ndisease and cancer were perceived as positive outcomes\nof being cured. However, while participants were keen to\nshare their cure stories with peers and the communities,\nthey also articulated a continuing fear of \u201couting\u201d them\ufffeselves as someone who contracted a disease most preva\ufffelent among people who inject drugs. As discussed, this\nlabel can have severe social ramifications such as alien\ufffeation and discrimination that result in poor access to\nhealth services, [22, 23] and the ongoing fear of stigma\ncreated a barrier to sharing the good news.\nIn Australia, the number of people initiating DAAs\nhas plateaued from extremely high volumes in 2016\nto a lower but constant number during 2017.\nAlthough evidence suggests that Australia has a high\ndiagnosis rate of approximately 80%, [24] the quality\nand understanding of the meaning of the diagnosis is\nunknown. Increasing testing rates and subsequent en\ufffegagement in treatment is essential if hepatitis C elim\ufffeination is to be achieved. Hence it is vital to engage\nand re-engage people with, or at risk of hepatitis C,\nmany who were given outdated information decades\nago or were frightened by the side effects associated\nwith interferon-based therapy. Re-engaging people\nwith or at risk of hepatitis C requires a committed\nhealth system response and knowledgeable and en\ufffegaged health professionals, as well as directly promot\ufffeing the experience of people with recent treatment\nexperience. A first step could be a systematic testing\ncampaign where the benefits of cure negate the po\ufffetential fear of stigma and discrimination associated\nwith hepatitis C. Integrating and normalising hepatitis\nC treatment and care in the primary care setting with\nsystematic programs that offer testing to all patients\nattending the practice regardless of risk factors is one\npossible strategy [25].\nIn the current study, 13 participants were na\u00efve to pre\ufffevious hepatitis C treatment, including interferon-based\nregimens. These participants were among the first group\ntreated in Australia and sought DAA treatment quickly;\ntwo participants reported being forced to commence the\nDAAs early due to the imminent risk of illness resulting\nfrom severe liver disease. The desire to physically re\ufffemove the virus and reduce their risk of morbidity and\nmortality was the predominant motivator to accessing\nthe DAAs, however, the psychological impact of being\ncured was significant.\nOne barrier to accessing DAAs noted by several\nparticipants was the lack of knowledge and awareness\namong health professionals about hepatitis C and the\nDAAs. Twelve participants accessed DAAs through a\ntertiary hospital clinic because they had all been attend\ufffeing the clinic for several years for ongoing surveillance\nand monitoring of their liver health. Whereas the eight\nparticipants recruited from a community-based clinic\nhad sought out the clinics for the purpose of accessing\nDAAs, although technically they should have been able\nto access them through any GP. It is worth noting that\nthis study was conducted during the early DAA imple\ufffementation phase in Australia; while the initial proportion\nof DAA prescriptions initiated by primary care practi\ufffetioners was low (8%), it steadily increased over time to\n39% in June 2017 [3]. Therefore, while participants were\nall able to find health services or practitioners that could\nfacilitate access to the DAAs, this was not a universally\nstraightforward at the time the interviews were conducted.\nRelying on individuals\u2019 personal motivation to access\nRichmond et al. Hepatology, Medicine and Policy (2018) 3:8 Page 7 of 9\n\nDAAs is not a sustainable response. There are many\nworkforce development projects underway in Australia,\nthat aim to build the capacity of primary care practitioners\nand ensure that people with hepatitis C have multiple\naccess points to DAA treatment; these programs need to\nbe sustained overtime.\nFuture promotion of the next wave of DAA candidates\nin Australia should draw on the firsthand experiences of\npeople who have been through the DAA treatment and\nhave achieved cure, including people who currently in\ufffeject drugs. Roger\u2019s \u2018Diffusion of Innovations\u2019 theory seeks\nto explain how, why, and at what rate new innovations\n(ideas, technology and/or products) gain momentum\nand diffuse or spread through a specific population.\nThis theory suggests that when an innovation, in this\ncase, DAAs, are promoted by respected individuals\nwithin a social network, it creates a desire to adopt\nthe innovation [26]. This perspective is supported by\nresearch that shows that people with hepatitis C have\nplayed an important role in engaging people who inject\ndrugs with hepatitis C in treatment services [27\u201330].\nThe limitations of this study should be acknowledged\nwhen interpreting the data; the small sample size and in\ufffeherent limitations regarding the generalisability of quali\ufffetative data at a population level and the timing of\nrecruitment during the early stages of the DAA imple\ufffementation in Australia could all affect the relevance of\nthis data to the current cohort of people seeking DAA\ntreatment. Study participants most likely represent early\nadopters of the DAAs, who sought out the treatment be\ufffecause they were well informed and motivated, compared\nto people currently accessing treatment who have pre\ufffeferred to wait and gather evidence of the DAA\u2019s success.\nThe environment, in terms of the public\u2019s and health\nworkforce\u2019s awareness has most likely improved over time,\nmaking access to treatment less reliant on highly moti\ufffevated individuals. The focus of this study was on partici\ufffepants\u2019 experiences of being cured, therefore, demographic\ninformation about participants\u2019 age, mode of infection and\nliver disease staging were not systematically collected. The\nauthors acknowledge that these factors may influence peo\ufffeple\u2019s experience of being cured of hepatitis C.\nMost participants in this study found DAAs easy to\ntake with generally mild and manageable side-effects.\nNonetheless they indicated it was important to acknow\ufffeledge the potential for DAA side effects, as this would\nenable people to plan and establish contingency plans\nfor the treatment course and support adherence. Overall,\nadherence to the DAAs was not an issue of concern, in\nthis study, participants described how they identified\ntheir own memory hooks and existing routines to sup\ufffeport the daily administration of the DAAs [31]. However,\nthese participants were particularly motivated to achieve\na cure. In the future, more planning and support may be\nneeded to support adherence for people who are more\nsceptical about the DAAs and of their own need to\nachieve a cure.\nThe perspectives of participants who currently inject\ndrugs illustrates that the availability and effectiveness of\nDAAs are not the only factors that influence their\ndecision to start treatment, which is supported by\nGoutzamanis and colleagues (2016) [32]. Health promo\ufffetion messages need to shift the perceptions of current\ninjectors around treatment and re-treatment to ensure\nthey understand that DAAs are universally available and\npeople who currently inject are a priority population for\ntreatment access. In providing hepatitis C treatment and\ncare, clinicians, pharmacists and other service providers\nshould highlight the individual health benefits of\nre-treatment and the population level benefits of stop\ufffeping onward transmission. The issue of re-infection also\ndemonstrates the importance of promoting ongoing\nhepatitis C testing for current injectors and for continu\ufffeing investment in harm reduction programs including\nneedle and syringe programs.\nConclusion\nFuture engagement strategies targeting people with\nhepatitis C who are not currently accessing DAA treat\ufffement need to use the lived experience of being cured,\nparticularly the significant psychological impact such as\nrelief about no longer being a transmission risk for\nfamily members. Promoting this alongside the health\nbenefits offered by the hepatitis C cure, and having a\nreduced risk of developing liver disease and liver cancer\nare crucial in supporting elimination efforts.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors acknowledge the participants who shared their stories and Dr.\nRos Le Gautier (La Trobe University), and Ms. Lisa Stothers and Ms. Susanne\nGlasgow (St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital Melbourne) for assistance with recruitment.\nFunding\nThis study was funded through an unrestricted grant from AbbVie Pty Ltd.\nAvailability of data and materials\nThe datasets used and/or analysed during the current study are available\nfrom the corresponding author on reasonable request.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions\nJR, JE, JW, PH, MH and AT all contributed to the design of the study and\nsubmission of a funding submission; JE conducted the interviews; JR,\nRT and JE all contributed to the analysis of the interview data including\ndevelopment of the coding frame; all authors contributed to the\ndevelopment, review and submission of the manuscript.

            "response": "This qualitative study explores the experiences of individuals who have achieved a sustained viral response (SVR) after taking direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for hepatitis C. The study involved 20 participants from one metropolitan hospital-based liver clinic and three affiliated community-based clinics in Melbourne, Australia. The study found that the psychological impact of achieving an SVR was often prioritized over physical symptoms, as participants reported feeling relieved of the psychological burden of living with hepatitis C and being less uncertain about their health. Many participants also reported feeling \"normal\" again, as they no longer felt infectious or had to take special precautions around family members or partners. These findings suggest that addressing the psychological aspects of hepatitis C treatment may be important for improving treatment uptake and adherence, especially in light of the high rates of SVR achieved with DAAs. Additionally, the study highlights the need for ongoing efforts to address stigma and discrimination against individuals with hepatitis C, as well as the importance of providing adherence support and peer worker support to patients with hepatitis C on DAAs. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the experiences of individuals with hepatitis C and highlights the need for holistic approaches to managing the disease.",

In the four best\nquality between country comparisons, presumed consent\nlaw or practice was associated with increased organ\ndonation\u2014increases of 25-30%, 21-26%, 2.7 more\ndonors per million population, and 6.14 more donors per\nmillion population in the four studies. Other factors found\nto be important in at least one study were mortality from\nroad traffic accidents and cerebrovascular causes,\ntransplant capacity, gross domestic product per capita,\nhealth expenditure per capita, religion (Catholicism),\neducation, public access to information, and a common\nlaw legal system. Eight surveys of attitudes to presumed\nconsent were of the UK public. These surveys varied in the\nlevel of support for presumed consent, with surveys\nconducted before 2000 reporting the lowest levels of\nsupport (28-57%). The most recent survey, in 2007,\nreported that 64% of respondents supported a change to\npresumed consent.\nConclusion Presumed consent alone is unlikely to explain\nthe variation in organ donation rates between countries.\nLegislation, availability of donors, organisation and\ninfrastructure of the transplantation service, wealth and\ninvestment in health care, and public attitudes to and\nawareness of organ donation may all play a part, but their\nrelative importance is unclear. Recent UK surveys show\nsupport for presumed consent, though with variation in\nresults that may reflect differences in survey methods.\nINTRODUCTION\nThere is currently an insufficient supply of donor\norgans to meet the demand for organ transplantations\nin the United Kingdom and worldwide. The UK active\ntransplant waiting list is increasing by about 8% a year,\nand the ageing population and increasing incidence of\ntype 2 diabetes are likely to exacerbate the shortage of\navailable organs.1 2There were 13.2 dead organ donors\nper million population in the UK in 2007, substantially\nlower than in several other European countries and\nespecially Spain, which had a rate of 34.3 per million\npopulation for the same year.3\nIn 2006 the UK Organ Donation Taskforce was\nestablished with the task of identifying barriers to\ndonation and making recommendations for increasing\norgan donation and procurement within the current\nlegal framework. An explicit or informed consent\nsystem operates in the UK and requiresthat individuals\nauthorise organ removal after death by carrying a\ndonor card or joining a national registry. An overhaul\nof UK transplant services is planned following the\ntaskforce\u2019s recommendations.1 These included estab\ufffelishing a UK-wide organisation to identify and allocate\norgans, doubling the number of transplant coordina\ufffetors, having an organ donation \u201cchampion\u201d in each\nhospital trust, and improving the processes for\nidentifying potential donors and the monitoring of\ndonation activity in all hospitals.\nSeveral countries, including Spain, Austria, and\nBelgium, have opted for a change in legislation and\nintroduced presumed consent, whereby organs can be\nused for transplantation after death unless individuals\nhave objected during their lifetime (an opt out system).\nCountries vary in how organ donation legislation\nfunctions in practice, and the terms \u201chard\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d\nhave been used to characterise how much emphasis is\nplaced on relatives\u2019 views in these countries. For\nexample, in Spain the presumed consent law is \u201csoft\u201d in\nthat doctors take active measures to ascertain that the\nnext of kin do not object to organ recovery. In Austria\nthe presumed consent law is relatively \u201chard\u201d in that\nCentre for Reviews and\nDissemination (CRD), University of\nYork, York YO10 5DD\nCorrespondence to: C McDaid\ncm36@york.ac.uk\nCite this as: BMJ 2009;338:a3162\ndoi:10.1136/bmj.a3162\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 1 of 8Protected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n.

A secondary objective was to assess the\nliterature on public attitudes to presumed consent.\nMETHODS\nSearch strategy\nWe searched seven electronic databases from incep\ufffetion to January 2008 without language restrictions.\nInternet searches were carried out using the specialist\nengine Intute (www.intute.ac.uk/healthandlifes\nciences/) and the meta-search engine Copernic\n(www.copernic.com). In addition, we browsed relevant\norganisation websites for additional information and\nchecked the reference lists of included studies. Further\ndetails of the search strategy are in the full report.5\nStudy selection and inclusion criteria\nWe sought empirical studies that examined the impact\nof having a system of presumed consent on organ\ndonation rates (see box 1). Eligible studies were those\nwhich compared organ donation rates before and after\nthe introduction of presumed consent or where organ\ndonation rates were compared in countries with and\nwithout systems of presumed consent.\nWe assessed public and professional attitudes to\norgan donation and presumed consent. Only studies\nusing survey methods and that focused explicitly on\norgan donation and presumed consent were included.\nSurveysfrom outsidethe UK were eligiblefor inclusion\nas they were a potentially useful source of contextual\ninformation for the evaluation studies from other\ncountries.\nTwo reviewers independently screened all titles and\nabstracts. The full papers of relevant citations were\nobtained and independently screened by the two\nreviewers. Disagreements were resolved by discussion\nand consensus, and if necessary a third reviewer was\nconsulted.\nData extraction and quality assessment\nTo investigate the impact of presumed consent on\norgan donation rates we extracted data about study\ndesign and method of analysis, country or countries\ninvestigated, time period, contextual factors and\nwhether these were included in the analysis, donation\nrates, and any other outcomes, such as negative effects.\nWe assessed study quality using criteria from a\nprevious systematic review, and derived from the\nEffective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP)\nquality assessment tool for quantitative studies (see\nbox 2).6\nTo assess attitudes to presumed consent, we extra\ufffected data about the survey methods, the participants,\nsurvey questions, and the key findings.We assessed the\nmethodological quality of the surveys using a list of\nquestions for the appraisal of surveys taken from The\nPocket Guide to Critical Appraisal.\n7 Data were extracted\nand the quality criteria applied by one reviewer and\nchecked by a second reviewer. A statistician also\nassessedthe appropriateness of any regression analyses\nused in the between country comparison studies.\nData synthesis\nGiven the diversity of the studies investigating the\nimpact of presumed consent, we undertook a narrative\nsynthesis. Studies were grouped based on study design,\nand the results were interpreted in the context of their\nmethodological strengths and weaknesses and any\ncontextual factors that might affect outcomes. The data\nfrom surveys were synthesised, taking into account\nissues of importance identified during the quality\nassessment.\nRESULTS\nTwenty six studies met our inclusion criteria (see\nfigure). Of these, five assessed organ donation rates\nbefore and after the introduction of presumed consent\nlegislation in a single country,w1-w5 eight compared\norgan donation rates in countries with presumed\nconsent systems with rates in countries with explicit\nBox 1: Inclusion and exclusion criteria for studies in systematic review\nPopulation and setting\u2014Any jurisdiction in which a system for deceased organ donation\nhad been introduced\nIntervention\u2014Presumed consent system for organ donation at death.

All five studies, which\nrepresented the experience of three countries, found an\nincrease in organ donation rates following the intro\ufffeduction of presumed consent legislation (table 1). In\nAustria the 4.6 donors per million population per year\nbefore legislation increased to 10.1 per million in the\nfour years after the introduction of presumed consent\nand to 27.2 per million in the five years after\nintroduction of infrastructure changes including full\ntime transplant coordinators.w1 In Belgium kidney\ndonation increased from 18.9 to 41.3 per million\npopulation per year over a three year period,w3 and in\nSingapore kidney procurement increased from 4.7 to\n31.3 per million population, also over a three year\nperiod.w4\nHowever, there was limited exploration of other\nchanges such as increased publicity and organisational\nand infrastructure changes that might have taken place\nat the same time as the change in legislation. As such\nfactors are likely to influence donation rates, it is\nunclearto what extentthe increasesfound were directly\nattributable to the change in legislation.\nImpact of presumed consent on organ donation rates in\nbetween country comparisons\nThe eight studies that compared organ donation rates\nin countries with presumed consent systems with those\nin countries with explicit or informed consent or other\nsimilar systems were based on secondary analyses of\npublished data (table 2). Therefore, any relation found\nbetween presumed consent and organ donation rate is\nassociative and cannot show whether the effect was\ndirectly attributable to the intervention, and this is\nreflected in the quality assessment.\nSix studies included factors likely to influence organ\ndonation rates, such as mortality from road traffic\ncrashes and health systems, in their analyses.w6-w11 Four\nof the eight comparisons between countries had\nsignificant limitations, either from lack of any formal\nstatistical analysis or important limitations in the\nanalysis.w7 w10 w12 w13 and we focus here on the findings\nof the more robust studies.w6 w8 w9 w11\nThesefour studies explored between three and seven\nexplanatory variables in addition to legislation for\npresumed consent (see table 3). The number of\ncountries and their rationale for inclusion varied, but\nseveral countries were common across more than one\nstudy.Three ofthe studies classified countries as having\nexplicit or presumed consent based on the country\u2019s\nlegislation, whereas one studyw8 used a classification\nsystem based on how presumed consent operated in\npractice rather than in law.

Switzerland has a\nnational informed consent law, but many of its\nconstituent jurisdictions (cantons) have their own\npresumed consent laws: it was recorded having explicit\nconsent in two studiesw8 w11 and in one as having\npresumed consent.w9\nThe studies also varied in the sources of data used,\nthe time period covered, and the type of analyses\nperformed. Table 3 gives a summary of the analysis,\nthe variables considered, and the factors that were\nfound to be statistically significant predictors in at least\none of the models used in each study. Three of the four\nstudies showed a significant association between\npresumed consent and increased organ donation\nrates.w6 w8 w11 The fourth study reported a positive but\nnot significant association.w9 The size of the increase in\norgan donation rates with presumed consent varied:\n25-30% higher,w6 21-26% higher,w11 2.7 more donors\nper million population,w9 and 6.14 more donors per\nmillion population.w8\nImpact of other factors on organ donation rates\nAlthough the four robust studies suggest that presumed\nconsent law was associated with increased organ\ndonation rates, other explanatory factors were asso\ufffeciated with variation in donation rates between\ncountries (see table 3). (Further details about these\nare available in the full report. 5\n) Organ donation would\nbe expected to depend to some extent on the\navailability of potential donors, and, in thethree studies\nwhere it was considered, mortality from road traffic\naccidents showed a significant association with dona\ufffetion rate (and in one study this was the only factor that\nhad a significant association with donation ratesw9).\nThe extent and efficiency of a country\u2019s transplant\ncoordination might also be expected to influence organ\ndonation rates. In the one study that considered it,\ntransplant capacity (defined as the number of trans\ufffeplant centres per million population) was positively\nassociated with higher donation rates and within the\nstatistical model it was the factor with the greatest\npredictive strength, greater than presumed consent\npractice, religion, and education.w8\nThree of the four studies investigated the influence of\nwealth or healthcare expenditure.w6 w9 w11 Two entered\ngross domestic product per capita and health expen\ufffediture per capita into separate models as they were\nfound to be highly collinear,w6 w11 and one used public\nhealth expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic\nproduct rather than health expenditure per capita.w9\nGross domestic product per capita and health expen\ufffediture per capita were the strongest predictors of\ndonation rates in one model, stronger than presumed\nconsent law.w11 In another gross domestic product per\ncapita was significantly associated with donation\nrates,w6 and a positive association was found in\nanotherw9 but it is unclear whether this reached\nstatistical significance.\nThe percentage of the population in higher educa\ufffetion was included in one study, in order to assess the\ninfluence of social demographics on donation rates,\nand there was a significant positive association.w8\nThe only religion investigated was Catholicism,\nwhich is probably a reflection of the countries included\nin the models. It has been suggested that Catholicism\nmay be associated with favourable attitudes towards\norgan donation as the religion officially recognises\norgan transplantation as a \u201cservice of life.\u201d It was a\nsignificant positive predictor of donation rates in one\nstudyw8 and of importance in some sections of the\nregression model in another,w11 but not in a study that\nspecifically included only Western Catholic and\nProtestant countries.w6 The differences may be partly\nexplained by different samples of included countries.\nFor example, only one study included Latin American\nand South American countries.w11\nTwo studies investigated the legislative system\n(common law versus civil law) based on the view that\ndonation rates under a common law legal system, with\nits emphasis on individual rights, might differ from that\nunder civil law, which places more emphasis on the\nTable 2 | Details of between country comparison studies of legislation for presumed consent for organ donation\nStudy\nCountry or region included\nin the analysis\nQuality assessment*\nSelection Comparability\nData\ncollection\nAttributable to\nintervention\nAppropriate\nanalysis\nStudies with robust analysis\nAbadie (2006)w6 22 Western Christian countries + ++ ++ ? ++\nGimbel (2003)w8 28 European countries + ++ \u2212 ? ++\nHealy (2005)w9 17 OECD countries + ++ + ? ++\nNeto (2007)w11 34 OECD and non-OECD countries ++ ++ + ? ++\nStudies with significant limitations\nCoppen (2005)w7 10 European countries \u2212 + ++ \u2212 \u2212\nJohnson (2004)w10 17 countries ? ++ ? \u2212 \u2212\nMcCunn (2003)w13 Two adult trauma hospitals, one in US\nand one in Austria\n\u2212 \u2212 ++ \u2212 \u2212\nRoels (1996)w12 Four member countries of\nEurotransplant\n+ \u2212 ++ \u2212 \u2212\n*Quality assessment: ++ = criterion met, + = criterion partially met, \u2212 = criterion not met, ? = unclear from information provided.\nOECD = Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.\nRESEARCH\npage 4 of 8 BMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.comProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n.

We found four good quality\nstudies comparing organ donation rates between\ncountries with and without systems of presumed\nconsent.w6 w8 w9 w11 Each study examined the associa\ufffetion between presumed consent and organ donation\nrates in mainly European countries between 1990 and\n2002. All four found an association between presumed\nconsent legislation and higher organ donation rates,\nand in three this was statistically significant.\nEstimates of the size of the effect varied: two studies\nreported a 20-30%increasein organ donation,w6 w11one\nreported 2.7 more donors per million population,w9\nand one reported 6.1 more donors per million\npopulation.w8 There was evidence that factors other\nthan presumed consent contributed to the variation in\norgan donation rates. In at least one study, mortality\nfrom road traffic accidents, the number of transplant\ncentres, gross domestic product per capita, and health\nexpenditure per capita were found to be important.\nFive before and after studies also showed an increase in\norgan donation rates following the introduction of\npresumed consent.\nWe investigated public attitudes towards presumed\nconsent through surveys carried out in the UK and\nelsewhere. The eight UK surveys suggest variation in\nthe level of support for presumed consent, with earlier\nsurveys finding lower levels of support. The most\nrecent survey reported that 64% of respondents\nsupported a change to presumed consent.

The\nsmall number of studies identified may be the result of\nour searchesfailing to identify all relevant publications,\nsuch evaluations not being performed, or the findings\nof evaluations not being publicly available. Others\nhave noted the difficulties in obtaining documentation\nabout the effects of national-level initiatives9 and the\nfact that strategic policies tend not to receive the same\nevaluative attention as, for example, medical\nprocedures.10\nThe available studies had methodological weak\ufffenesses. We evaluated three different types of research\nevidence\u2014before and after studies, between country\ncomparisons using secondary data, and surveys.\nUnlike evaluations of medical interventions, the\n\u201chierarchy\u201d of evidence is not clear when evaluating\na policy such as a change in legislation. The before and\nafter studies and the cross country comparisons each\nhave strengths and weaknesses. Before and after studies\nhave a quasi-experimental design and provide evi\ufffedence on the experience of individual countries, but\ntheir usefulness was limited by the small number of\ncountries covered and the lack of information about,\nand in-depth analysis of, any structural and contextual\nchanges during the same time period. Such changes\nmight have contributed to the increases in donation\nrates.\nThe studies comparing different countries per\ufffeformed secondary analysis of data obtained from\ncountries with and without presumed consent legisla\ufffetion in place. They can show only associations between\nlegislation and organ donation rates, but they had the\nadvantage of exploring the impact of other important\nfactors such as mortality from road traffic accidents.\nEach study included explanatory factors based on what\nthe authors considered important, and these varied\nbetween studies, as didtheir relative importance.Other\nfactors likely to be important were not investigated. For\nexample, Catholicism was the only religion consid\ufffeered, despite the likely importance of other religions\nsuch as Islam and Judaism, which have been reported\nto have a negative impact on organ donation rates.11\nThe countries represented in the studies were mainly\nWestern European. Although this increases the like\ufffelihood that the findings are generalisable to the UK, it\nresulted in considerable overlap between the samples\nused. This duplication means that the studies are\nnaturally biased towards giving similar results.\nAlthough presumed consent is not a binary variable,\nit has been treated as such in the between country\ncomparisons. Countries vary in the nature of their\nlegislation and how the legislation is interpreted. Of\nkey importance is the extent of consultation about\ndonation with relatives of the deceased. This was partly\naddressed in one study that compared countries on the\nbasis of how legislation was implemented in practice,\nrather than the actual legislation in place.w8 Regardless\nof the legislative system, the procedures for contact\nwith relatives of newly deceased people are likely to be\nimportant determinants in whether consent is given.\nThe surveys provided useful information about\npublic attitudes to presumed consent, but important\nmethodological detail was not available in four of the\nsurveys and caution is needed in the interpretation of\nthe findings. There was also little exploration of\npotential differences across sociodemographic groups.\nIn addition, attitudes alone are unlikely to be a reliable\npredictor of behaviour. This is already reflected in the\ngap between high levels of support for organ donation\nin UK surveys and lower rates of registration on the\norgan donor register.\nConclusions\nThe available evidence suggeststhat presumed consent\nis associated with increased organ donation rates, even\nwhen other factors are accounted for. However, it\ncannot be inferred from this that the introduction of\npresumed consent legislation per se will lead to an\nincrease in organ donation rates. The availability of\npotential donors, the underpinning infrastructure for\ntransplantation, wealth and investment in health care,\nand underlying public attitudes may all have a role.\nThis review cannot be fully informative with respect\nto policy. It focuses on a particular aspect of the\nevidence and does not address all the relevant issues.\nTo fully inform policy the findings of this systematic\nreview need to be considered in the context of the\ncurrent UK infrastructure for organ donation, the\npossible impact on donation rates of introducing the\nrecommendations from the UK Organ Donation\nTaskforce,1 the moral and ethical issues of presumed\nconsent, and how the public may respond.\nThe evidence in this review was primarily in relation\nto country-level indicators such as gross domestic\nproduct and deaths from road traffic accidents. Further\nwork is required to investigate factors at the personal\nlevel that may modify donor rates such as how families\nare approached to discuss donation of a relative\u2019s\norgans. A review of qualitative research addressing\nthese issues would be useful, and further primary\nresearch may also be necessary.\nPolicy evaluation using a before and after design\nshould collect information relating to context, to\nensure that potentially important factors other than\nthe intervention itself are given proper consideration.\nWHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS TOPIC\nThe supply of donor organs is insufficient to meet the need for transplantation in the UK, and a\nchange in legislation to one of presumed consent has been proposed\nThe introduction of presumed consent legislation in other countries is thought to have led to\nincreased donation rates\nWHAT THIS STUDY ADDS\nThe evidence suggests that presumed consent law is associated with increased organ\ndonation rates\nOther factors such as availability of potential donors, infrastructure for transplantation,\ninvestment in health care, and public attitudes may all have a role, but the relative importance\nof these factors is unclear\nRESEARCH\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 7 of 8Protected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n.

            "response": "This systematic review aimed to evaluate the impact of presumed consent legislation on organ donation rates and explore public attitudes towards presumed consent. The review included 26 studies from various countries, representing both before and after studies and between country comparisons. The results showed that all five before and after studies found an increase in organ donation rates following the implementation of presumed consent legislation. However, the studies had limitations due to the absence of controlling for other known or unknown factors that could have influenced donation rates. The eight between country comparisons also had limitations due to the lack of formal statistical analysis or important limitations in the analysis. The review suggested that presumed consent legislation was associated with increased organ donation rates, but other factors such as availability of potential donors, infrastructure for transplantation, wealth and investment in healthcare, and underlying public attitudes may also have a role. The review highlighted the need for further research to investigate factors at the personal level that may modify donor rates and to consider the findings of this review in the context of the current UK infrastructure for organ donation, the possible impact of implementing the recommendations from the UK Organ Donation Taskforce, moral and ethical issues surrounding presumed consent, and how the public may respond. The review also recommended the development of reporting guidelines similar to those for other study designs and careful consideration of how families are approached to discuss donation of a relative\u2019s organs.",

                "It has been claimed and demonstrated that many (and \npossibly most) of the conclusions drawn from biomedi\ufffecal research are probably false1\n. A central cause for this \nimportant problem is that researchers must publish in \norder to succeed, and publishing is a highly competitive \nenterprise, with certain kinds of findings more likely to \nbe published than others. Research that produces novel \nresults, statistically significant results (that is, typically \np<0.05) and seemingly \u2018clean\u2019 results is more likely to be \npublished2,3\n. As a consequence, researchers have strong \nincentives to engage in research practices that make \ntheir findings publishable quickly, even if those prac\ufffetices reduce the likelihood that the findings reflect a true \n(that is, non-null) effect4\n. Such practices include using \nflexible study designs and flexible statistical analyses \nand running small studies with low statistical power1,5\n. \nA simulation of genetic association studies showed \nthat a typical dataset would generate at least one false \npositive result almost 97% of the time6\n, and two efforts \nto replicate promising findings in biomedicine reveal \nreplication rates of 25% or less7,8\n. Given that these pub\ufffelishing biases are pervasive across scientific practice, it \nis possible that false positives heavily contaminate the \nneuroscience literature as well, and this problem may \naffect at least as much, if not even more so, the most \nprominent journals9,10.\nHere, we focus on one major aspect of the problem: \nlow statistical power. The relationship between study \npower and the veracity of the resulting finding is \nunder-appreciated. Low statistical power (because of \nlow sample size of studies, small effects or both) nega\ufffetively affects the likelihood that a nominally statistically \nsignificant finding actually reflects a true effect. We dis\ufffecuss the problems that arise when low-powered research \ndesigns are pervasive. In general, these problems can be \ndivided into two categories. The first concerns prob\ufffelems that are mathematically expected to arise even if \nthe research conducted is otherwise perfect: in other \nwords, when there are no biases that tend to create sta\ufffetistically significant (that is, \u2018positive\u2019) results that are \nspurious. The second category concerns problems that \nreflect biases that tend to co\u2011occur with studies of low \npower or that become worse in small, underpowered \nstudies. We next empirically show that statistical power \nis typically low in the field of neuroscience by using evi\ufffedence from a range of subfields within the neuroscience \nliterature. We illustrate that low statistical power is an \nendemic problem in neuroscience and discuss the impli\ufffecations of this for interpreting the results of individual \nstudies.\nLow power in the absence of other biases\nThree main problems contribute to producing unreliable \nfindings in studies with low power, even when all other \nresearch practices are ideal. They are: the low probability of \nfinding true effects; the low positive predictive value (PPV; \nsee BOX\u00a01 for definitions of key statistical terms) when an \neffect is claimed; and an exaggerated estimate of the mag\ufffenitude of the effect when a true effect is discovered.

All rights reserved\n\nFirst, low power, by definition, means that the chance \nof discovering effects that are genuinely true is low. That \nis, low-powered studies produce more false negatives \nthan high-powered studies. When studies in a given \nfield are designed with a power of 20%, it means that if \nthere are 100 genuine non-null effects to be discovered \nin that field, these studies are expected to discover only \n20 of\u00a0them11.\nSecond, the lower the power of a study, the lower \nthe probability that an observed effect that passes the \nrequired threshold of claiming its discovery (that is, \nreaching nominal statistical significance, such as p<0.05) \nactually reflects a true effect1,12. This probability is called \nthe PPV of a claimed discovery. The formula linking the \nPPV to power is:\nwhere (1\u2212\u03b2) is the power, \u03b2 is the type\u00a0II error, \u03b1 is the \ntype\u00a0I error and R is the pre-study odds (that is, the odds \nthat a probed effect is indeed non-null among the effects \nbeing probed). The formula is derived from a simple \ntwo-by-two table that tabulates the presence and non\ufffepresence of a non-null effect against significant and \nnon-significant research findings1\n. The formula shows \nthat, for studies with a given pre-study odds R, the \nlower the power and the higher the type\u00a0I error, the \nlower the PPV. And for studies with a given pre-study \nodds R and a given type\u00a0I error (for example, the tra\ufffeditional p = 0.05 threshold), the lower the power, the \nlower the\u00a0PPV.\nFor example, suppose that we work in a scientific field \nin which one in five of the effects we test are expected to \nbe truly non-null (that is, R=1/(5\u20131)=0.25) and that we \nclaim to have discovered an effect when we reach p<0.05; \nif our studies have 20% power, then PPV=0.20\u00d70.25 /\n(0.20\u00d70.25+0.05)=0.05/0.10=0.50; that is, only half of \nour claims for discoveries will be correct. If our studies \nhave 80% power, then PPV=0.80\u00d70.25 /(0.80\u00d70.25+\n0.05)=0.20 / 0.25=0.80; that is, 80% of our claims for \ndiscoveries will be correct. \nThird, even when an underpowered study discovers a \ntrue effect, it is likely that the estimate of the magnitude \nof that effect provided by that study will be exaggerated. \nThis effect inflation is often referred to as the \u2018winner\u2019s \ncurse\u201913 and is likely to occur whenever claims of discov\ufffeery are based on thresholds of statistical significance (for \nexample, p<0.05) or other selection filters (for example, \na Bayes factor better than a given value or a false-discov\ufffeery rate below a given value). Effect inflation is worst for \nsmall, low-powered studies, which can only detect effects \nthat happen to be large. If, for example, the true effect is \nmedium-sized, only those small studies that, by chance, \noverestimate the magnitude of the effect will pass the \nthreshold for discovery. To illustrate the winner\u2019s curse, \nsuppose that an association truly exists with an effect size \nthat is equivalent to an odds ratio of 1.20, and we are try\ufffeing to discover it by performing a small (that is, under\ufffepowered) study. Suppose also that our study only has the \npower to detect an odds ratio of 1.20 on average 20% of \nthe time. The results of any study are subject to sampling \nvariation and random error in the measurements of the \nvariables and outcomes of interest. Therefore, on aver\ufffeage, our small study will find an odds ratio of 1.20 but, \nbecause of random errors, our study may in fact find an \nodds ratio smaller than 1.20 (for example, 1.00) or an odds \nratio larger than 1.20 (for example, 1.60). Odds ratios of \n1.00 or 1.20 will not reach statistical significance because \nof the small sample size. We can only claim the association \nas nominally significant in the third case, where random \nBox 1 | Key statistical terms\nCAMARADES\nThe Collaborative Approach to Meta-Analysis and Review of Animal Data from \nExperimental Studies (CAMARADES) is a collaboration that aims to reduce bias and \nimprove the quality of methods and reporting in animal research. To this end, \nCAMARADES provides a resource for data sharing, aims to provide a web-based \nstratified meta-analysis bioinformatics engine and acts as a repository for completed \nreviews.\nEffect size\nAn effect size is a standardized measure that quantifies the size of the difference \nbetween two groups or the strength of an association between two variables. As \nstandardized measures, effect sizes allow estimates from different studies to be \ncompared directly and also to be combined in meta-analyses.\nExcess significance\nExcess significance is the phenomenon whereby the published literature has an \nexcess of statistically significant results that are due to biases in reporting.\nSeveral mechanisms contribute to reporting bias, including study publication bias, \nwhere the results of statistically non-significant (\u2018negative\u2019) studies are left \nunpublished; selective outcome reporting bias, where null results are omitted; and \nselective analysis bias, where data are analysed with different methods that favour \n\u2018positive\u2019 results.\nFixed and random effects\nA fixed-effect meta-analysis assumes that the underlying effect is the same (that is, \nfixed) in all studies and that any variation is due to sampling errors. By contrast, a \nrandom-effect meta-analysis does not require this assumption and allows for \nheterogeneity between studies. A test of heterogeneity in between-study effects is \noften used to test the fixed-effect assumption.\nMeta-analysis\nMeta-analysis refers to statistical methods for contrasting and combining results from \ndifferent studies to provide more powerful estimates of the true effect size as opposed \nto a less precise effect size derived from a single study.\nPositive predictive value\nThe positive predictive value (PPV) is the probability that a \u2018positive\u2019 research finding \nreflects a true effect (that is, the finding is a true positive). This probability of a research \nfinding reflecting a true effect depends on the prior probability of it being true (before \ndoing the study), the statistical power of the study and the level of statistical \nsignificance.\nProteus phenomenon\nThe Proteus phenomenon refers to the situation in which the first published study is \noften the most biased towards an extreme result (the winner\u2019s curse). Subsequent \nreplication studies tend to be less biased towards the extreme, often finding evidence \nof smaller effects or even contradicting the findings from the initial study.\nStatistical power\nThe statistical power of a test is the probability that it will correctly reject the null \nhypothesis when the null hypothesis is false (that is, the probability of not committing a \ntype\u00a0II error or making a false negative decision). The probability of committing a type\u00a0II \nerror is referred to as the false negative rate (\u03b2), and power is equal to 1 \u2013 \u03b2.\nWinner\u2019s curse\nThe winner\u2019s curse refers to the phenomenon whereby the \u2018lucky\u2019 scientist who makes a \ndiscovery is cursed by finding an inflated estimate of that effect. The winner\u2019s curse \noccurs when thresholds, such as statistical significance, are used to determine the \npresence of an effect and is most severe when thresholds are stringent and studies are \ntoo small and thus have low power.\nNature Reviews |\nPPV = ([1 \u2013 \u03b2] \u00d7 R) \u2044 ([1\u2212 \u03b2] \u00d7 R + \u03b1)\nANALYSIS\n366 | MAY 2013 | VOLUME 14 www.nature.com/reviews/neuro\n\u00a9 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The winner\u2019s curse \nmeans, therefore, that the \u2018lucky\u2019 scientist who makes \nthe discovery in a small study is cursed by finding an \ninflated\u00a0effect.\nThe winner\u2019s curse can also affect the design and con\ufffeclusions of replication studies. If the original estimate of \nthe effect is inflated (for example, an odds ratio of 1.60), \nthen replication studies will tend to show smaller effect \nsizes (for example, 1.20), as findings converge on the \ntrue effect. By performing more replication studies, we \nshould eventually arrive at the more accurate odds ratio \nof 1.20, but this may take time or may never happen if we \nonly perform small studies. A common misconception \nis that a replication study will have sufficient power to \nreplicate an initial finding if the sample size is similar to \nthat in the original study14. However, a study that tries \nto replicate a significant effect that only barely achieved \nnominal statistical significance (that is, p~0.05) and that \nuses the same sample size as the original study, will only \nachieve ~50% power, even if the original study accurately \nestimated the true effect size. This is illustrated in FIG.\u00a01. \nMany published studies only barely achieve nominal sta\ufffetistical significance15. This means that if researchers in a \nparticular field determine their sample sizes by historical \nprecedent rather than through formal power calculation, \nthis will place an upper limit on average power within \nthat field. As the true effect size is likely to be smaller \nthan that indicated by the initial study \u2014 for example, \nbecause of the winner\u2019s curse \u2014 the actual power is likely \nto be much lower. Furthermore, even if power calcula\ufffetion is used to estimate the sample size that is necessary \nin a replication study, these calculations will be overly \noptimistic if they are based on estimates of the true \neffect size that are inflated owing to the winner\u2019s curse \nphenomenon. This will further hamper the replication \nprocess.\nLow power in the presence of other biases\nLow power is associated with several additional biases. \nFirst, low-powered studies are more likely to pro\ufffevide a wide range of estimates of the magnitude of an \neffect (which is known as \u2018vibration of effects\u2019 and is \ndescribed below). Second, publication bias, selective \ndata analysis and selective reporting of outcomes are \nmore likely to affect low-powered studies. Third, small \nstudies may be of lower quality in other aspects of their \ndesign as well. These factors can further exacerbate the \nlow reliability of evidence obtained in studies with low \nstatistical\u00a0power.\nVibration of effects13 refers to the situation in which \na study obtains different estimates of the magnitude of \nthe effect depending on the analytical options it imple\ufffements. These options could include the statistical model, \nthe definition of the variables of interest, the use (or not) \nof adjustments for certain potential confounders but not \nothers, the use of filters to include or exclude specific \nobservations and so on. For example, a recent analysis \nof 241 functional MRI (fMRI) studies showed that 223 \nunique analysis strategies were observed so that almost \nno strategy occurred more than once16. Results can vary \nmarkedly depending on the analysis strategy1\n. This is \nmore often the case for small studies \u2014 here, results can \nchange easily as a result of even minor analytical manipu\ufffelations. In small studies, the range of results that can be \nobtained owing to vibration of effects is wider than in \nlarger studies, because the results are more uncertain and \ntherefore fluctuate more in response to analytical changes. \nImagine, for example, dropping three observations from \nthe analysis of a study of 12 samples because post-hoc \nthey are considered unsatisfactory; this manipulation \nmay not even be mentioned in the published paper, which \nFigure 1 | Statistical power of a replication study. a | If \na study finds evidence for an effect at p=0.05, then the \ndifference between the mean of the null distribution \n(indicated by the solid blue curve) and the mean of the \nobserved distribution (dashed blue curve) is 1.96\u00d7sem. \nb | Studies attempting to replicate an effect using the \nsame sample size as that of the original study would have \nroughly the same sampling variation (that is, sem) as in the \noriginal study. Assuming, as one might in a power \ncalculation, that the initially observed effect we are trying \nto replicate reflects the true effect, the potential \ndistribution of these replication effect estimates would be \nsimilar to the distribution of the original study (dashed \ngreen curve). A study attempting to replicate a nominally \nsignificant effect (p~0.05), which uses the same sample \nsize as the original study, would therefore have (on \naverage) a 50% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis \n(indicated by the coloured area under the green curve) and \nthus only 50% statistical power. c | We can increase the \npower of the replication study (coloured area under the \norange curve) by increasing the sample size so as to reduce \nthe sem. Powering a replication study adequately (that is, \nachieving a power \u226580%) therefore often requires a larger \nsample size than the original study, and a power \ncalculation will help to decide the required size of the \nreplication sample.\nANALYSIS\nNATURE REVIEWS | NEUROSCIENCE VOLUME 14 | MAY 2013 | 367\n\u00a9 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

When investigators select the most favourable, \ninteresting, significant or promising results among a wide \nspectrum of estimates of effect magnitudes, this is inevi\ufffetably a biased\u00a0choice.\nPublication bias and selective reporting of outcomes \nand analyses are also more likely to affect smaller, under\ufffepowered studies17. Indeed, investigations into publication \nbias often examine whether small studies yield different \nresults than larger ones18. Smaller studies more readily \ndisappear into a file drawer than very large studies that \nare widely known and visible, and the results of which are \neagerly anticipated (although this correlation is far from \nperfect). A \u2018negative\u2019 result in a high-powered study can\ufffenot be explained away as being due to low power19,20, and \nthus reviewers and editors may be more willing to pub\ufffelish it, whereas they more easily reject a small \u2018negative\u2019 \nstudy as being inconclusive or uninformative21. The pro\ufffetocols of large studies are also more likely to have been \nregistered or otherwise made publicly available, so that \ndeviations in the analysis plans and choice of outcomes \nmay become obvious more easily. Small studies, con\ufffeversely, are often subject to a higher level of exploration \nof their results and selective reporting thereof.\nThird, smaller studies may have a worse design quality \nthan larger studies. Several small studies may be oppor\ufffetunistic experiments, or the data collection and analysis \nmay have been conducted with little planning. Conversely, \nlarge studies often require more funding and personnel \nresources. As a consequence, designs are examined more \ncarefully before data collection, and analysis and reporting \nmay be more structured. This relationship is not absolute \n\u2014 small studies are not always of low quality. Indeed, a \nbias in favour of small studies may occur if the small stud\ufffeies are meticulously designed and collect high-quality data \n(and therefore are forced to be small) and if large studies \nignore or drop quality checks in an effort to include as \nlarge a sample as possible.\nEmpirical evidence from neuroscience\nAny attempt to establish the average statistical power in \nneuroscience is hampered by the problem that the true \neffect sizes are not known. One solution to this problem \nis to use data from meta-analyses. Meta-analysis pro\ufffevides the best estimate of the true effect size, albeit with \nlimitations, including the limitation that the individual \nstudies that contribute to a meta-analysis are themselves \nsubject to the problems described above. If anything, \nsummary effects from meta-analyses, including power \nestimates calculated from meta-analysis results, may also \nbe modestly inflated22.\nAcknowledging this caveat, in order to estimate sta\ufffetistical power in neuroscience, we examined neurosci\ufffeence meta-analyses published in 2011 that were retrieved \nusing \u2018neuroscience\u2019 and \u2018meta-analysis\u2019 as search terms. \nUsing the reported summary effects of the meta-analy\ufffeses as the estimate of the true effects, we calculated the \npower of each individual study to detect the effect indi\ufffecated by the corresponding meta-analysis.\nMethods. Included in our analysis were articles published \nin 2011 that described at least one meta-analysis of previ\ufffeously published studies in neuroscience with a summary \neffect estimate (mean difference or odds/risk ratio) as well \nas study level data on group sample size and, for odds/risk \nratios, the number of events in the control\u00a0group.\nWe searched computerized databases on 2\u00a0February \n2012 via Web of Science for articles published in 2011, \nusing the key words \u2018neuroscience\u2019 and \u2018meta-analysis\u2019. \nAll of the articles that were identified via this electronic \nsearch were screened independently for suitability by two \nauthors (K.S.B. and M.R.M.). Articles were excluded if no \nabstract was electronically available (for example, confer\ufffeence proceedings and commentaries) or if both authors \nagreed, on the basis of the abstract, that a meta-analysis \nhad not been conducted.

Articles were excluded at this stage if \nthey could not provide the following data for extraction for at least one meta-analysis: \nfirst author and summary effect size estimate of the meta-analysis; and first author, \npublication year, sample size (by groups) and number of events in the control group (for \nodds/risk ratios) of the contributing studies. Data extraction was performed \nindependently by K.S.B. and M.R.M. or C.M. and verified collaboratively. In total, n=48 \narticles were included in the analysis.\nANALYSIS\n368 | MAY 2013 | VOLUME 14 www.nature.com/reviews/neuro\n\u00a9 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved\n\nData were extracted from forest plots, tables and text. \nSome articles reported several meta-analyses. In those \ncases, we included multiple meta-analyses only if they \ncontained distinct study samples. If several meta-analyses \nhad overlapping study samples, we selected the most com\ufffeprehensive (that is, the one containing the most studies) \nor, if the number of studies was equal, the first analysis \npresented in the article. Data extraction was indepen\ufffedently performed by K.S.B. and either M.R.M. or C.M. \nand verified collaboratively.\nThe following data were extracted for each meta\ufffeanalysis: first author and summary effect size estimate \nof the meta-analysis; and first author, publication year, \nsample size (by groups), number of events in the control \ngroup (for odds/risk ratios) and nominal significance \n(p<0.05, \u2018yes/no\u2019) of the contributing studies. For five \narticles, nominal study significance was unavailable and \nwas therefore obtained from the original studies if they \nwere electronically available. Studies with missing data \n(for example, due to unclear reporting) were excluded \nfrom the analysis.\nThe main outcome measure of our analysis was the \nachieved power of each individual study to detect the \nestimated summary effect reported in the corresponding \nmeta-analysis to which it contributed, assuming an \u03b1 level \nof 5%. Power was calculated using G*Power software23. \nWe then calculated the mean and median statistical \npower across all studies.\nResults. Our search strategy identified 246 articles pub\ufffelished in 2011, out of which 155 were excluded after \nan initial screening of either the abstract or the full \ntext. Of the remaining 91 articles, 48 were eligible for \ninclusion in our analysis24\u201371, comprising data from 49 \nmeta-analyses and 730 individual primary studies. A \nflow chart of the article selection process is shown in \nFIG.\u00a02, and the characteristics of included meta-analyses \nare described in TABLE\u00a01.\nOur results indicate that the median statistical power \nin neuroscience is 21%. We also applied a test for an \nexcess of statistical significance72. This test has recently \nbeen used to show that there is an excess significance bias \nin the literature of various fields, including in studies of \nbrain volume abnormalities73, Alzheimer\u2019s disease genet\ufffeics70,74 and cancer biomarkers75. The test revealed that the \nactual number (349) of nominally significant studies in \nour analysis was significantly higher than the number \nexpected (254; p<0.0001). Importantly, these calcula\ufffetions assume that the summary effect size reported in each \nstudy is close to the true effect size, but it is likely that \nthey are inflated owing to publication and other biases \ndescribed\u00a0above.\nInterestingly, across the 49 meta-analyses included \nin our analysis, the average power demonstrated a clear \nbimodal distribution (FIG.\u00a03). Most meta-analyses com\ufffeprised studies with very low average power \u2014 almost \n50% of studies had an average power lower than 20%. \nHowever, seven meta-analyses comprised studies with \nhigh (>90%) average power24,26,31,57,63,68,71. These seven \nmeta-analyses were all broadly neurological in focus \nand were based on relatively small contributing studies \n\u2014 four out of the seven meta-analyses did not include \nany study with over 80 participants. If we exclude these \n\u2018outlying\u2019 meta-analyses, the median statistical power \nfalls to 18%.\nSmall sample sizes are appropriate if the true effects \nbeing estimated are genuinely large enough to be reliably \nobserved in such samples. However, as small studies are \nparticularly susceptible to inflated effect size estimates and \npublication bias, it is difficult to be confident in the evi\ufffedence for a large effect if small studies are the sole source \nof that evidence. Moreover, many meta-analyses show \nsmall-study effects on asymmetry tests (that is, smaller \nstudies have larger effect sizes than larger ones) but never\ufffetheless use random-effect calculations, and this is known \nto inflate the estimate of summary effects (and thus also \nthe power estimates). Therefore, our power calculations \nare likely to be extremely optimistic76.\nEmpirical evidence from specific fields\nOne limitation of our analysis is the under-representation \nof meta-analyses in particular subfields of neuroscience, \nsuch as research using neuroimaging and animal mod\ufffeels. We therefore sought additional representative meta\ufffeanalyses from these fields outside our 2011 sampling frame \nto determine whether a similar pattern of low statistical \npower would be observed.\nNeuroimaging studies. Most structural and volumetric \nMRI studies are very small and have minimal power \nto detect differences between compared groups (for \nexample, healthy people versus those with mental health \ndiseases). A cl ear excess significance bias has been dem\ufffeonstrated in studies of brain volume abnormalities73, \nand similar problems appear to exist in fMRI studies \nof the blood-oxygen-level-dependent response77. In \norder to establish the average statistical power of stud\ufffeies of brain volume abnormalities, we applied the same \nanalysis as described above to data that had been pre\ufffeviously extracted to assess the presence of an excess of \nsignificance bias73. Our results indicated that the median \nstatistical power of these studies was 8% across 461 indi\ufffevidual studies contributing to 41 separate meta-analyses, \nwhich were drawn from eight articles that were published \nbetween 2006 and 2009. Full methodological details \ndescribing how studies were identified and selected are \navailable elsewhere73.\nAnimal model studies. Previous analyses of studies using \nanimal models have shown that small studies consist\ufffeently give more favourable (that is, \u2018positive\u2019) results than \nlarger studies78 and that study quality is inversely related \nto effect size79\u201382. In order to examine the average power \nin neuroscience studies using animal models, we chose \na representative meta-analysis that combined data from \nstudies investigating sex differences in water maze per\ufffeformance (number of studies (k)=19, summary effect \nsize Cohen\u2019s d = 0.49) and radial maze performance \n(k=21, summary effect size d=0.69)80. The summary \neffect sizes in the two meta-analyses provide evidence for \nmedium to large effects, with the male and female per\ufffeformance differing by 0.49 to 0.69 standard deviations \nANALYSIS\nNATURE REVIEWS | NEUROSCIENCE VOLUME 14 | MAY 2013 | 369\n\u00a9 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Our results \nindicate that the median statistical power for the water \nmaze studies and the radial maze studies to detect these \nmedium to large effects was 18% and 31%, respectively \n(TABLE\u00a02). The average sample size in these studies was 22 \nanimals for the water maze and 24 for the radial maze \nexperiments. Studies of this size can only detect very \nlarge effects (d=1.20 for n=22, and d=1.26 for n=24) \nwith 80% power \u2014 far larger than those indicated by \nthe meta-analyses. These animal model studies were \ntherefore severely underpowered to detect the summary \neffects indicated by the meta-analyses. Furthermore, the \nsummary effects are likely to be inflated estimates of the \ntrue effects, given the problems associated with small \nstudies described\u00a0above.\nThe results described in this section are based on \nonly two meta-analyses, and we should be appropriately \ncautious in extrapolating from this limited evidence. \nNevertheless, it is notable that the results are so con\ufffesistent with those observed in other fields, such as the \nneuroimaging and neuroscience studies that we have \ndescribed\u00a0above.\nImplications\nImplications for the likelihood that a research finding \nreflects a true effect. Our results indicate that the aver\ufffeage statistical power of studies in the field of neurosci\ufffeence is probably no more than between ~8% and ~31%, \non the basis of evidence from diverse subfields within \nneuro-science. If the low average power we observed \nacross these studies is typical of the neuroscience lit\ufffeerature as a whole, this has profound implications for \nthe field. A major implication is that the likelihood that \nany nominally significant finding actually reflects a true \neffect is small. As explained above, the probability that \na research finding reflects a true effect (PPV) decreases \nas statistical power decreases for any given pre-study \nodds (R) and a fixed type\u00a0I error level. It is easy to show \nthe impact that this is likely to have on the reliability of \nfindings. FIGURE\u00a04 shows how the PPV changes for a range \nof values for R and for a range of v alues for the average \npower in a field. For effects that are genuinely non-null, \nFIG.\u00a05 shows the degree to which an effect size estimate \nis likely to be inflated in initial studies \u2014 owing to the \nwinner\u2019s curse phenomenon \u2014 for a range of values for \nstatistical\u00a0power.\n The estimates shown in FIGS\u00a04,5 are likely to be opti\ufffemistic, however, because they assume that statistical \npower and R are the only considerations in determin\ufffeing the probability that a research finding reflects a true \neffect. As we have already discussed, several other biases \nare also likely to reduce the probability that a research \nfinding reflects a true effect. Moreover, the summary \neffect size estimates that we used to determine the statis\ufffetical power of individual studies are themselves likely to \nbe inflated owing to bias \u2014 our excess of significance test \nprovided clear evidence for this.

In order to achieve 80% \npower to detect, in a single study, the most probable true \neffects as indicated by the meta-analysis, a sample size \nof 134 animals would be required for the water maze \nexperiment (assuming an effect size of d = 0.49) and \n68 animals for the radial maze experiment (assuming \nan effect size of d=0.69); to achieve 95% power, these \nsample sizes would need to increase to 220 and 112, \nrespectively. What is particularly striking, however, is \nthe inefficiency of a continued reliance on small sample \nsizes. Despite the apparently large numbers of animals \nrequired to achieve acceptable statistical power in these \nexperiments, the total numbers of animals actually used \nin the studies contributing to the meta-analyses were \neven larger: 420 for the water maze experiments and \n514 for the radial maze experiments.\nThere is ongoing debate regarding the appropriate \nbalance to strike between using as few animals as possi\ufffeble in experiments and the need to obtain robust, reliable \nfindings. We argue that it is important to appreciate the \nwaste associated with an underpowered study \u2014 even a \nstudy that achieves only 80% power still presents a 20% \npossibility that the animals have been sacrificed with\ufffeout the study detecting the underlying true effect. If the \naverage power in neuroscience animal model studies is \nbetween 20\u201330%, as we observed in our analysis above, \nthe ethical implications are\u00a0clear.\nLow power therefore has an ethical dimension \u2014 \nunreliable research is inefficient and wasteful. This applies \nto both human and animal research. The principles of the \n\u2018three Rs\u2019 in animal research (reduce, refine and replace)83\nrequire appropriate experimental design and statistics \n\u2014 both too many and too few animals present an issue \nas they reduce the value of research outputs. A require\ufffement for sample size and power calculation is included \nin the Animal Research: Reporting In\u00a0Vivo Experiments \n(ARRIVE) guidelines84, but such calculations require a \nclear appreciation of the expected magnitude of effects \nbeing\u00a0sought.\nOf course, it is also wasteful to continue data col\ufffelection once it is clear that the effect being sought does \nnot exist or is too small to be of interest. That is, studies \nare not just wasteful when they stop too early, they are \nalso wasteful when they stop too late. Planned, sequen\ufffetial analyses are sometimes used in large clinical trials \nwhen there is considerable expense or potential harm \nassociated with testing participants. Clinical trials may \nbe stopped prematurely in the case of serious adverse \neffects, clear beneficial effects (in which case it would be \nunethical to continue to allocate participants to a placebo \ncondition) or if the interim effects are so unimpressive \nthat any prospect of a positive result with the planned \nsample size is extremely unlikely85. Within a significance \ntesting framework, such interim analyses \u2014 and the pro\ufffetocol for stopping \u2014 must be planned for the assump\ufffetions of significance testing to hold. Concerns have been \nraised as to whether stopping trials early is ever justified \ngiven the tendency for such a practice to produce inflated \neffect size estimates86. Furthermore, the decision process \naround stopping is not often fully disclosed, increasing \nthe scope for researcher degrees of freedom86. Alternative \napproaches exist. For example, within a Bayesian frame\ufffework, one can monitor the Bayes factor and simply stop \ntesting when the evidence is conclusive or when resources \nFigure 4 | Positive predictive value as a function of the \npre-study odds of association for different levels of \nstatistical power. The probability that a research finding \nreflects a true effect \u2014 also known as the positive \npredictive value (PPV) \u2014 depends on both the pre-study \nodds of the effect being true (the ratio R of \u2018true effects\u2019 \nover \u2018null effects\u2019 in the scientific field) and the study\u2019s \nstatistical power. The PPV can be calculated for given \nvalues of statistical power (1 \u2013 \u03b2), pre-study odds ratio (R) \nand type\u00a0I error rate (\u03b1), using the formula PPV=([1 \u2013 \u03b2]\u00d7R) \n\u2044 ([1\u2212 \u03b2]\u00d7R+\u03b1). The median statistical power of studies in \nthe neuroscience field is optimistically estimated to be \nbetween ~8% and ~31%. The figure illustrates how low \nstatistical power consistent with this estimated range \n(that is, between 10% and 30%) detrimentally affects the \nassociation between the probability that a finding reflects \na true effect (PPV) and pre-study odds, assuming \u03b1=0.05. \nCompared with conditions of appropriate statistical \npower (that is, 80%), the probability that a research finding \nreflects a true effect is greatly reduced for 10% and 30% \npower, especially if pre-study odds are low.

Similarly, adopting conservative priors \ncan substantially reduce the likelihood of claiming that \nan effect exists when in fact it does not85. At present, \nsignificance testing remains the dominant framework \nwithin neuroscience, but the flexibility of alternative (for \nexample, Bayesian) approaches means that they should \nbe taken seriously by the\u00a0field.\nConclusions and future directions\nA consequence of the remarkable growth in neurosci\ufffeence over the past 50\u00a0years has been that the effects we \nnow seek in our experiments are often smaller and more \nsubtle than before as opposed to when mostly easily dis\ufffecernible \u2018low-hanging fruit\u2019 were targeted. At the same \ntime, computational analysis of very large datasets is now \nrelatively straightforward, so that an enormous number of \ntests can be run in a short time on the same dataset. These \ndramatic advances in the flexibility of research design and \nanalysis have occurred without accompanying changes to \nother aspects of research design, particularly power. For \nexample, the average sample size has not changed sub\ufffestantially over time88 despite the fact that neuroscientists \nare likely to be pursuing smaller effects. The increase in \nresearch flexibility and the complexity of study designs89\ncombined with the stability of sample size and search for \nincreasingly subtle effects has a disquieting consequence: \na dramatic increase in the likelihood that statistically sig\ufffenificant findings are spurious. This may be at the root of \nthe recent replication failures in the preclinical literature8\nand the correspondingly poor translation of these findings \ninto humans90.\nLow power is a problem in practice because of the \nnormative publishing standards for producing novel, \nsignificant, clean results and the ubiquity of null \nhypothesis significance testing as the means of evaluat\ufffeing the truth of research findings. As we have shown, \nthese factors result in biases that are exacerbated by low \npower. Ultimately, these biases reduce the reproducibil\ufffeity of neuroscience findings and negatively affect the \nvalidity of the accumulated findings. Unfortunately, \npublishing and reporting practices are unlikely to \nchange rapidly. Nonetheless, existing scientific practices \ncan be improved with small changes or additions that \napproximate key features of the idealized model4,91,92. \nWe provide a summary of recommendations for future \nresearch practice in BOX\u00a02.\nIncreasing disclosure. False positives occur more fre\ufffequently and go unnoticed when degrees of freedom in \ndata analysis and reporting are undisclosed5\n. Researchers \ncan improve confidence in published reports by noting \nin the text: \u201cWe report how we determined our sample \nsize, all data exclusions, all data manipulations, and all \nmeasures in the study.\u201d7\n When such a statement is not \npossible, disclosure of the rationale and justification of \ndeviations from what should be common practice (that \nis, reporting sample size, data exclusions, manipula\ufffetions and measures) will improve readers\u2019 understand\ufffeing and interpretation of the reported effects and, \ntherefore, of what level of confidence in the reported \neffects is appropriate. In clinical trials, there is an \nincreasing requirement to adhere to the Consolidated \nStandards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT), and the \nsame is true for systematic reviews and meta-analyses, \nfor which the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic \nReviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines are \nnow being adopted. A number of reporting guidelines \nhave been produced for application to diverse study \ndesigns and tools, and an updated list is maintained \nby the EQUATOR Network93. A ten-item checklist of \nstudy quality has been developed by the Collaborative \nApproach to Meta-Analysis and Review of Animal Data \nin Experimental Stroke (CAMARADES), but to the best \nof our knowledge, this checklist is not yet widely used in \nprimary studies.\nFigure 5 | The winner\u2019s curse: effect size inflation as \na function of statistical power. The winner\u2019s curse \nrefers to the phenomenon that studies that find evidence \nof an effect often provide inflated estimates of the size of \nthat effect. Such inflation is expected when an effect has \nto pass a certain threshold \u2014 such as reaching statistical \nsignificance \u2014 in order for it to have been \u2018discovered\u2019. \nEffect inflation is worst for small, low-powered studies, \nwhich can only detect effects that happen to be large. If, \nfor example, the true effect is medium-sized, only those \nsmall studies that, by chance, estimate the effect to be \nlarge will pass the threshold for discovery (that is, the \nthreshold for statistical significance, which is typically \nset at p<0.05). In practice, this means that research \nfindings of small studies are biased in favour of inflated \neffects. By contrast, large, high-powered studies can \nreadily detect both small and large effects and so are less \nbiased, as both over- and underestimations of the true \neffect size will pass the threshold for \u2018discovery\u2019. We \noptimistically estimate the median statistical power of \nstudies in the neuroscience field to be between ~8% and \n~31%. The figure shows simulations of the winner\u2019s curse \n(expressed on the y\u2011axis as relative bias of research \nfindings). These simulations suggest that initial effect \nestimates from studies powered between ~ 8% and ~31% \nare likely to be inflated by 25% to 50% (shown by the \narrows in the figure). Inflated effect estimates make it \ndifficult to determine an adequate sample size for \nreplication studies, increasing the probability of type\u00a0II \nerrors.

However, presenting the result of an \nexploratory analysis as if it arose from a confirmatory \ntest inflates the chance that the result is a false positive. \nIn particular, p\u2011values lose their diagnostic value if they \nare not the result of a pre-specified analysis plan for \nwhich all results are reported. Pre-registration \u2014 and, \nultimately, full reporting of analysis plans \u2014 clarifies \nthe distinction between confirmatory and explora\ufffetory analysis, encourages well-powered studies (at least \nin the case of confirmatory analyses) and reduces the \nfile-drawer effect. These subsequently reduce the likeli\ufffehood of false positive accumulation. The Open Science \nFramework (OSF) offers a registration mechanism for \nscientific research. For observational studies, it would \nbe useful to register datasets in detail, so that one can be \naware of how extensive the multiplicity and complexity \nof analyses can\u00a0be94.\nImproving availability of materials and data. Making \nresearch materials available will improve the quality \nof studies aimed at replicating and extending research \nfindings. Making raw data available will improve data \naggregation methods and confidence in reported \nresults. There are multiple repositories for making data \nmore widely available, such as The Dataverse Network \nProject and Dryad) for data in general and others \nsuch as OpenfMRI, INDI and OASIS for neuroimag\ufffeing data in particular. Also, commercial repositories \n(for example, figshare) offer means for sharing data \nand other research materials. Finally, the OSF offers \ninfrastructure for documenting, archiving and sharing \ndata within collaborative teams and also making some \nor all of those research materials publicly available. \nLeading journals are increasingly adopting policies for \nmaking data, protocols and analytical codes available, \nat least for some types of studies. However, these poli\ufffecies are uncommonly adhered to95, and thus the ability \nfor independent experts to repeat published analysis \nremains\u00a0low96.\nIncentivizing replication. Weak incentives for conduct\ufffeing and publishing replications are a threat to identifying \nfalse positives and accumulating precise estimates of \nresearch findings. There are many ways to alter repli\ufffecation incentives97. For example, journals could offer a \nsubmission option for registered replications of impor\ufffetant research results (see, for example, a possible new \nsubmission format for Cortex98). Groups of researchers \ncan also collaborate on performing one or many replica\ufffetions to increase the total sample size (and therefore the \nstatistical power) achieved while minimizing the labour \nand resource impact on any one contributor. Adoption \nof the gold standard of large-scale collaborative con\ufffesortia and extensive replication in fields such as human \ngenome epidemiology has transformed the reliability \nof the produced findings. Although previously almost \nall of the proposed candidate gene associations from \nsmall studies were false99 (with some exceptions100), col\ufffelaborative consortia have substantially improved power, \nand the replicated results can be considered highly reli\ufffeable. In another example, in the field of psychology, the \nReproducibility Project is a collaboration of more than \n100 researchers aiming to estimate the reproducibility \nof psychological science by replicating a large sample of \nstudies published in 2008 in three psychology journals92. \nEach individual research study contributes just a small \nportion of time and effort, but the combined effect is \nsubstantial both for accumulating replications and for \ngenerating an empirical estimate of reproducibility.\nConcluding remarks. Small, low-powered studies are \nendemic in neuroscience. Nevertheless, there are reasons \nto be optimistic. Some fields are confronting the prob\ufffelem of the poor reliability of research findings that arises \nfrom low-powered studies. For example, in genetic epi\ufffedemiology sample sizes increased dramatically with the \nwidespread understanding that the effects being sought \nare likely to be extremely small. This, together with an \nincreasing requirement for strong statistical evidence \nand independent replication, has resulted in far more \nreliable results. Moreover, the pressure for emphasiz\ufffeing significant results is not absolute. For example, the \nProteus phenomenon101 suggests that refuting early \nresults can be attractive in fields in which data can be \nproduced rapidly. Nevertheless, we should not assume \nthat science is effectively or efficiently self-correcting102. \nThere is now substantial evidence that a large propor\ufffetion of the evidence reported in the scientific literature \nmay be unreliable. Acknowledging this challenge is the \nfirst step towards addressing the problematic aspects \nof current scientific practices and identifying effective \nsolutions.\nBox 2 | Recommendations for researchers\nPerform an a\u00a0priori power calculation\nUse the existing literature to estimate the size of effect you are looking for and design \nyour study accordingly. If time or financial constraints mean your study is \nunderpowered, make this clear and acknowledge this limitation (or limitations) in the \ninterpretation of your results.\nDisclose methods and findings transparently\nIf the intended analyses produce null findings and you move on to explore your data in \nother ways, say so. Null findings locked in file drawers bias the literature, whereas \nexploratory analyses are only useful and valid if you acknowledge the caveats and \nlimitations.\nPre-register your study protocol and analysis plan\nPre-registration clarifies whether analyses are confirmatory or exploratory, encourages \nwell-powered studies and reduces opportunities for non-transparent data mining and \nselective reporting. Various mechanisms for this exist (for example, the Open Science \nFramework).\nMake study materials and data available\nMaking research materials available will improve the quality of studies aimed at \nreplicating and extending research findings. Making raw data available will enhance \nopportunities for data aggregation and meta-analysis, and allow external checking of \nanalyses and results.\nWork collaboratively to increase power and replicate findings\nCombining data increases the total sample size (and therefore power) while minimizing \nthe labour and resource impact on any one contributor. Large-scale collaborative \nconsortia in fields such as human genetic epidemiology have transformed the reliability \nof findings in these fields.\nANALYSIS\n374 | MAY 2013 | VOLUME 14 www.nature.com/reviews/neuro\n\u00a9 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

            "response": "This article discusses the issue of low statistical power in neuroscience research, which leads to inflated effect sizes and excessive significance levels. It explains how low power arises due to small sample sizes, and highlights the implications of this for the validity and reliability of research findings. The article suggests ways to address this problem, such as increasing sample sizes, improving study design, and conducting more replication studies. It also mentions several resources and initiatives aimed at promoting transparency, accuracy, and replicability in research, such as CAMARADES, Consort, figshare, EQUATOR Network, OpenfMRI, OSF, PRISMA, and The Dataverse Network Project. Overall, the article emphasizes the need for greater awareness and action to tackle the issue of low statistical power in neuroscience research, in order to ensure the credibility and trustworthiness of scientific findings.",

One large health \ncare organization that tried to implement the CCM in primary care provided an \nopportunity to study these issues. \nMETHODS We conducted a qualitative, comparative case study of 5 of 18 group \nclinics 18 to 23 months after the implementation began. Built on knowledge \nof the clinics from a previous study of advanced access implementation, data \nincluded in-depth interviews with organizational leaders and varied clinic person\ufffenel, observation of clinic care processes, and review of written materials.\nRESULTS Relatively small and highly variable care process changes were made \nduring the study period. The change process underwent several marked shifts in \nstrategy when initial efforts failed to achieve much and bore little resemblance \nto the change process used in the previously successful large-scale implementa\ufffetion of advanced access scheduling. Many barriers were identifi ed, including too \nmany competing priorities, a lack of specifi city and agreement about the care \nprocess changes desired, and little engagement of physicians. \nCONCLUSION These fi ndings highlight specifi c organizational challenges with \nhealth care transformation in the absence of a blueprint more specifi c than \nthe CCM. Effective models of organizational change and detailed examples of \nproven, feasible care changes still need to be demonstrated if we are to trans\ufffeform care as called for by the Institute of Medicine. \nAnn Fam Med 2006;4:317-326.

The Institute of Medicine \n(IOM) reports that the care delivered is frequently not the care that \npatients should receive given current medical knowledge.1\n The IOM has \ncalled on health care organizations to \u201cdesign and implement more effec\ufffetive organizational support processes to make change in the delivery of \ncare possible.\u201d1\n The same themes have been called for by the Future of Pri\ufffemary Care conference and the Future of Family Medicine project.2,3\nIn line with these recommendations, the Chronic Care Model (CCM) \nconceptualizes care as prepared practice teams in productive interactions \nwith informed, activated patients (Figure 1). Six elements appear important \nfor this end: the (1) overall health care organization, which must sup\ufffeport a (2) redesigned delivery system and (3) modern clinical information \nsystems; (4) systematic decision support; (5) self-management support for \npatients; and (6) links to available community resources.4,5\nMultidisciplinary practice teams are key to the CCM, but they require \nsubstantial redesign and reorientation from the existing care roles and \nprocesses that are oriented toward acute care.

Groups must fi gure out what the parts \nlook like and how to make them come together as a \nwhole. This challenge was encountered by a large mul\ufffetispecialty group in Minneapolis-St. Paul when in 2001 \nit chose to make CCM implementation in primary care \na cornerstone of its care improvement efforts. \nThe purpose of this article is to describe this medi\ufffecal group\u2019s effort to address the challenge of imple\ufffementing a CCM-type change so that others might \nlearn from its experience. Our study, designed to \nevaluate both the care system changes addressed and \nthe change process used to implement them, focused \non the following questions:\n1. Which CCM components were being addressed, \nand how well were they implemented?\n2. What change process strategies were used, both \ncentrally and at individual clinic sites?\n3. What important facilitators or barriers were \nencountered?\n4. What generalizable lessons and recommenda\ufffetions can be drawn from this experience?\nMETHODS\nPreintervention Context\nThis 600-physician multispecialty group was described \nin the preceding companion article.7\n The group overall \nwas led by a medical director and senior administrator, \nsupported by a council of medical and administrative \nleaders. It had successfully achieved a major care trans\ufffeformation in implementing an advanced access patient\ufffescheduling system throughout these clinics in 2000.8\nThe group also has had certain CCM elements in place \nfor some time, particularly guidelines, patient educa\ufffetion, chronic disease registries, and standing orders for \npreventive services. \nBefore instituting advanced access scheduling, the \nmedical group was relatively decentralized in its func\ufffetioning, and individual clinics, as well as individual \nphysicians, worked with relative autonomy. Clinics \nhad little systematization of care and few designated \nleadership roles. The advanced access change process \nled to strengthened central and clinic leadership, plus \nmore centralization of authority and lessened clinic \nand physician autonomy.8\nThe Intervention\nOrganizational leaders chose more complete imple\ufffementation of the CCM as a major priority for 2002, \nand later impetus was stimulated by a grant award from \nthe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Institute \nfor Healthcare Improvement intended to spur care \ntransformation. A project leader and various \nmultidisciplinary design teams were created \nto guide the effort, with particular focus on \naccess, diabetes care, and depression care. \nThe design teams developed a plan for more \nsystematic care processes, and individual \npilot care teams were designated in several \ndifferent clinics to test the implementation. \nOnce the new care processes had been tried \nfor a time, efforts were made to spread the \napproach from the pilot teams to their entire \nclinics, but any care changes were largely \nlimited by existing care patterns. Simultane\ufffeously, an electronic medical record (EMR) \ninformation system was rolled out in stages, \nalong with improvements in decision support \nand self-management support. \nBy mid-2002 the change strategy shifted \nfrom a condition-specifi c to a condition-neu\ufffetral focus that would apply across chronic \nconditions, and from pilot teams to 2 small \nprimary care clinics as research and develop\ufffement sites. A 2-day intensive design process \ndeveloped new patient care fl ows by con\ufffeceptualizing a 4-stage offi ce visit process: \nFigure 1. The Chronic Care Model.\nWagner EH.

Prepared \npractice teams (PPTs) were made up of a clinician and \nrooming nurse and were supplemented by a registered \nnurse and a receptionist who were shared among 3 \ncontiguous PPTs. Although this core PPT was under\ufffestood as having an expanded version that included \nother clinicians, implementation work focused largely \non the core team. \nIn April 2003, concerned about the slow pace of \nchange in these sites, medical group leaders expanded \nthis PPT and care fl ow concept throughout all the pri\ufffemary care clinics. They brought teams from all clinics \ntogether for a 1-day collaborative meeting to explain \nPPT roles and tasks. Though the overall change model \nwas still conceived in condition-neutral terms, clinics \nwere asked to select diabetes care, depression care, or \npreventive services as a focus for change measurement. \nDuring later sessions at each clinic, more-detailed \ntemplates of suggested PPT roles and tasks were pro\ufffemoted. Most ideas were for face-to-face work, although \nclinics that were further along in EMR implementation \nand skills were beginning to think in terms of virtual \nteamwork as well. \nIn sum, the CCM implementation effort relied \non medical group leaders to specify change aims and \nstrategies, the details of which changed several times \nfrom 2002 to 2004. The change process began by \nfocusing pilot work on a few clinics and then shifted to \ninvolve all clinics. It included expert design teams, rapid \ndesign processes, shared learning, and implementation \nplanning by clinics in 3 multiclinic 1-day collaborative \nmeetings; each clinic was expected to undertake its \nown approach to implementation. Clinic work was sup\ufffeported by 3 facilitators, some communication by e-mail \nand telephone, and monthly progress reports to project \nleaders. Consultants from the Institute for Healthcare \nImprovement provided input and external evaluation. \nEvaluation Approach \nThis study of the above change effort was designed \nto build on knowledge acquired through a previous \nqualitative evaluation of this group\u2019s successful imple\ufffementation of advanced access, and we used extensive \ninterviews and observations at both central leader and \nclinic levels.8\n We purposefully sampled 5 clinics from \nthe original 18 for a diverse range of size, location, \ndiabetes care performance, and medical group lead\ufffeers\u2019 assessment of their preliminary CCM efforts. In \nparticular, we looked for some clinics that would bet\ufffeter exemplify change barriers, as well as for those that \nwould better exemplify change facilitators. \nOne author (MH) conducted 45 semistructured \ninterviews with organizational leaders, external and \ninternal change leaders, midlevel clinic managers, medi\ufffecal and administrative clinic leaders, front-line physi\ufffecians, and nurses (53 persons). Questions focused on \nactual care changes, the change processes used, and \nperceived change facilitators and barriers. Descriptive \nfi eld notes of observed work in patient care areas, with \nspecial attention to PPT activities, helped in triangu\ufffelating interview fi ndings.9\n Institutional Review Board \napproval was obtained. The interviews and observations \nwere conducted during a 5-month period, beginning \n18 months into the overall CCM implementation and 6 \nmonths after systematic PPT work started in the clinics. \nAll interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed, and \ncombined with typed observation notes for review by \nthe fi rst 5 coauthors. Immersion-crystallization and \niterative consensus processes were used to develop the \nanalysis and interpretation.10,11 We sought disconfi rming \nTable 1.

Informant recall bias could not be measured specif\ufffeically but was dealt with through triangulating multiple \ninformant interviews, existing organizational documents, \nand the perspectives of 2 team members who were also \norganizational and change leaders (LIS, JSH). \nWe rated the level of CCM implementation at each \nclinic using a categorization developed by RAND.12\nWe looked at the highest level of CCM activity \nwithin each clinic, whether it was done generally or \nfocused on a specifi c condition (typically diabetes \ncare or depression care), and scored the presence of \ncomponents for each CCM element according to a \n3-point scale (Table 2, and Supplemental Table, avail\ufffeable at: http://www.annfammed.org/cgi/content/\nfull/4/ 317/DC1). For example, for the clinic with \nonly 1 offi cially designated pilot PPT, we scored \nthat team\u2019s activity rather than trying to contrive an \naverage score across nonexistent or minimally existent \nteams. Thus, this scoring tended to overestimate the \nextent of CCM implementation. \nRESULTS\nCare Process Changes \nA number of similarities were evident across the 5 clin\ufffeics studied. All showed at least some evidence of PPT \ndevelopment with a new sense of team identity and \nteamwork. The roles of registered nurses now included \nvarying amounts of team and patient care management. \nFocused attention was being given to previsit planning, \nincluding systematically reviewing and collating test \nresults, identifying preventive and other clinical ser\ufffevices needed, comparing care with established guide\ufffelines, and providing alerts for items needing attention \nat the visit. At some clinics, subgroups of patients were \ncalled to come in for previsit laboratory work. \nDespite these similarities, the differences among \nand within clinics were pronounced. For example, \nPPT structure and function varied widely. The cen\ufffetrally recommended design of 4 core PPT members \nhad been adopted by 3 of the 5 clinics. Another clinic \nadded a fi fth team member from the chartroom staff, \nand still another clinic designated all geographically \nadjacent personnel as a PPT (10 to 12 members). Clin\ufffeics and teams differed in their team leadership, and few \ninvolved the clinician more than peripherally. Team \nfunction across and within clinic sites seemed to be \nmore dependent on individual personalities than on \nsystematically planned and similar team roles.\nRegardless of the specifi c membership, fi nding team \nmeeting times was a universal logistic challenge, because \nwork schedules varied, clinic staffi ng was lean, and many \nfound it diffi cult to take time from more routine patient \ncare responsibilities. Although all PPTs were doing some \nprevisit planning, there was little standardization of care \nacross PPTs or clinics. Registered nurse and clerical roles \nchanged the most, with registered nurses often becom\ufffeing de facto PPT leaders and doing some care manage\ufffement. Clerical assistants in some clinics helped with \ncalling patients to come in for previsit laboratory work, \nand in most clinics at least part of their work was in \nphysical proximity to the registered nurses and licensed \npractical nurses, in contrast to previous physical separa\ufffetion. The licensed practical nurses working in tandem \nwith physicians showed fewer role changes. \nNonphysician staff commonly expressed apprecia\ufffetion for the newfound teamwork and the opportunity \nto be more involved in patient care. \n\u201cThis clinic is awesome, and what they\u2019ve done is \nincredible. Everything just feels and fl ows so much bet\ufffeter. You notice that things are much smoother. There \nisn\u2019t a lot of that chaotic sort of running around.

So it\u2019s a good place. What\u2019s \nmade the difference is the teamwork\u201d (Supervisor, \nclinic 3: interview 1). \n\u201cIt was clear to me that there was a very different \nenergy in this group compared to my visit 2 years ago \nfor the advanced access evaluation. Then, I remember \na sense of strain about the struggles of the changes \nthat had already taken place and anticipation of major \nstruggles around changes yet to come. The sense this \ntime was that those changes had been successfully \nnegotiated, and that there was a certain comfort about \nthe workings of things. I also sensed that this leader\ufffeship team seemed very comfortable and at ease with \neach other\u201d (Interviewer\u2019s notes, clinic 3).\nOn the other hand, clinic leaders, especially in the \nsmaller clinics, expressed concern that slim staffi ng \nmargins and infl exible job descriptions limited their \nability to innovate work roles. \nAmong the clinic similarities, the most striking \nwas that physician roles were generally unchanged. \nAlthough certain physicians were actively involved \nwith the changes either as named or as de facto lead\ufffeers, by and large, change happened around the physi\ufffecians and did not depend on their participation or \nengage them in a meaningful way. At least in part, this \nlack of engagement appeared related to the tradition \nand organizational history of physician autonomy. \nPhysician opinions about the value of previsit plan\ufffening also varied. Some believed that PPT previsit work \nenabled them to make therapeutic moves with patients \nmore quickly and easily (eg, intensifying diabetes \nmedications). \n\u201cThe visits are easier because you have the infor\ufffemation that you need, and you can do a lot more with \nthe visit. You can save a lot of time and actually go on \nto more important issues from the patient\u2019s perspec\ufffetive and also on changing the treatment, starting new \nmedications, and adjusting them\u201d (Physician, 5:2).\nOthers believed that such planning made no dif\ufffeference, because patient noncompliance was the chief \nconstraint for any care improvement. \n\u201cHaving information at the time that you\u2019re actu\ufffeally seeing the patient changes the fl ow in the offi ce a \nlot, about when things get done or who\u2019s calling about \nwhat. But we haven\u2019t fundamentally changed how we \nmotivate people. We\u2019re just pestering them on a differ\ufffeent end of that visit\u201d (Physician, 2:5).\nSuch comments seemed to refl ect a lack of aware\ufffeness of the need for any systemic care change, as well \nas the common medical professional pattern of blaming \npatients for the ills of their care results.13\nIn several of the clinics, structural space changes \npositioned PPT members closer together, which their \nleaders observed had improved team function. In clin\ufffeics where fl oor plans remained traditional (clerical \nstaff at front, licensed practical nurses in the middle \nnear examination rooms, individual physician offi ces \nin back, and registered nurses in a separate space), \nteamwork appeared constrained by the geography. Tra\ufffeditional workspace arrangements, in effect, segregated \nclinic staff by work discipline and did not provide \nshared, comfortable spaces for face-to-face multidisci\ufffeplinary teamwork. Although a fully functioning EMR \ncould provide a shared virtual workspace, at the time \nof our study, most clinics were still too new to elec\ufffetronic systems to use them facilely. \nInformation systems were an important element of \nthe CCM implementation in 2 major ways. First, the \n2-phase organizational implementation of an EMR, \ninitially mostly read-only but later fully interactive and \npaperless, was concurrent with other aspects of CCM \nimplementation. The demands of learning computer \nskills and using the new EMR reduced the ability to \nfocus more specifi cally on team and care changes, at \ntimes overwhelming all personnel. Second, the initial \nread-only EMR disrupted existing care processes, \nincluding fl ow sheets and registries. It did not permit \neasy collation of information necessary for care plan\ufffening, such as fl ow sheets of preventive services. It also \ndid not accommodate the importation or customiza\ufffetion of tools for information management. Information \nmanagement for planning and following patterns of \nclinical care often required a great amount of rework\ufffeing by the staff. In addition, the use of existing online \nchronic disease registries, eg, for diabetes, varied \nwidely across the clinics. The clinic with best use of \na registry had a software-savvy administrative leader \nwho customized their registry report to make it more \nuser-friendly, even though it required double entry of \ndata. The 2 clinics that did not use the registries at all \nreported they chose not to because the cost of rework\ufffeing information led to inaccuracies that were greater \nthan the potential benefi ts. \n\u201cI think registry lists never fl ew. We tried working. \nWe got registry lists from corporate. By the time you \ngot them, they were based on billing data, they were \nwrong, and it felt like just a tremendous waste of time \nto try and work that list. We had to clean it up and \nthen work it. It was just a ridiculous waste of time and \nno return\u201d (Supervisor, 1:1).\nOrganizational leaders agreed that clinic operations \nwere changing but believed that care practices were \nnot being dramatically transformed. At the time of the \ninterviews, they were not expecting much change in \npatient outcomes soon. There were struggles in devel\ufffeoping adequate change measures and little means for \naccountability. Nevertheless, many spoke of their hope \n\nANNALS OF FAMILY MEDICINE \u2726 WWW.ANNFAMMED.ORG \u2726 VOL. 4, NO. 4 \u2726 JULY/AUGUST 2006\n322\nCHRONIC CARE MODEL IMPLEMENTATION\nfor achieving change in the future, using such meta\ufffephors as a \u201cfoundation being laid,\u201d a \u201cplane ready for \ntake off,\u201d or being \u201cready to blossom.\u201d \nThe level of CCM implementation in each clinic, \nas rated by the authors from the interview and obser\ufffevational data, is displayed in Table 2. These fi ndings \nillustrate the relatively low level of implementation \nof the CCM elements and their components 2 years \ninto the process, even in the one clinic that was much \nmore successful in doing so. PPT development, hence \ndelivery system redesign, was the focus of most of \nthis CCM implementation effort. Clinical information \nsystems and health care organization were the other \nCCM elements with some notable changes. Scores in \nthe self-management support and decision support cat\ufffeegories more often related to tools and practices that \npredated the CCM implementation. \nChange Process\nThe change process used to implement these care \nprocess changes was strikingly different from what \nhad been used for the successful implementation of \nadvanced access scheduling 2 years earlier. Table 3 \nsummarizes these differences, most of which appeared \nto be related to the much less well-defi ned informa\ufffetion available about details or methodology of CCM \nimplementation. As a result, every clinic went about \nchange differently. Local clinic leader approaches \nranged from hands off to micromanaging, but mostly \nthey relied on the self-organizing initiative of indi\ufffeviduals and each PPT. \nOriginally, it was hoped that substantial transfor\ufffemation of care could be made within 1 year, but it \nquickly became apparent this much was not possible. \nChange strategies required major revision and time. As \n1 organizational leader said, \u201cWe are limited by human \ncapacity to change [and] we are rebuilding the airplane \nwhile it\u2019s fl ying.\u201d\nChange Facilitators and Barriers\nChange facilitators and barriers at both clinic and \norganizational levels are summarized in Table 4. \nNotable facilitators included the presence of a few \nstrong clinic leaders, such as a chief physician who \nenvisioned the specifi c changes needed and supervi\ufffesors who supported that vision. Clinic staff able to take \nleadership of PPTs became important change leaders \nfor individual teams. In other words, leadership ability \nneeded to be dispersed over multiple levels that ranged \nfrom overall clinic leaders to at least some clinic staff \nTable 3.

Physicians, even though not engaged, \ndid not openly resist the care changes, because those \nchanges that affected the availablilty of information \nand supported decision making made their lives easier. \nIn some clinics, personnel actions were taken with \nthose unwilling to make changes, including physicians; \nthese decisions were typically made at the clinic level \nand supported by central leaders. At 1 clinic, supervi\ufffesors believed such an action was the difference that \nallowed teamwork development to proceed. We heard \nno evidence of such changes being a disincentive for \nchange. As new forms of teamwork developed, the \ntrust, communication, and stable work relationships it \npromoted were self-reinforcing. \nBarriers to change included clinic leaders who \nfailed to develop a practical vision for the change or \nwho involved themselves less in change management. \nChange management skills appeared limited across \nall the clinics, and few clinics had organized change \nmanagement teams. There was little, if any, evidence \nof meaningful use of formal change processes, such as \nPDSA (plan, do, study, act) cycles. Staff experienced \nchange fatigue and apathy, the result of 4 years of \nmajor changes and many other priorities for quality \nimprovement, productivity increases, and cost reduc\ufffetion. Large organizational size meant clinic personnel \nwere relatively insulated from the business imperatives \nfor change that could motivate a smaller group. In \naddition, union rules placed constraints on how work \nroles might be reconfi gured. There was still no gener\ufffeally agreed-on sense that consistency or standardiza\ufffetion of care within or across clinics was valuable. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think that the culture at the clinic has really \nbought into the fact that there are some best ways to \ndo things and we should all do them that way. Even \naround immunizations, let\u2019s say. I had a nurse just \nrecently who said, \u2019I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever all recom\ufffemend the same thing.\u2019 Wow! That\u2019s amazing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \n(Physician leader, 2:1).\nFinally, the seeming contradiction of naming physi\ufffecians as both change facilitators and barriers (Table 4) \nrefl ects their professional power in shaping patient care \nprocesses and their general stance of neutral autonomy \nin this change. They neither actively supported nor \nactively resisted the change, so other clinic staff strate\ufffegically built change around them. The issue of physi\ufffecian autonomy and general lack of engagement in the \nchange process was not addressed systematically. \nTable 4.

Although the team changes \nappeared small, immensely varied within and among \nits clinics, and unlikely to be associated with major \nmeasurable improvements in care, they may represent a \nfi rst step in creating a new foundation for transformed \ncare. They illustrate that changing traditional care pat\ufffeterns is diffi cult and requires enormous attention and \nfocus, with clear specifi cations, strong leadership, and \nattention to a myriad of details at both local and cen\ufffetral levels of an organization. \nThe companion article, describing the related quan\ufffetitative quality measure results from our study, shows \nthat the improvements for diabetes care, coronary heart \ndisease care, and depression care occurred in outcomes \n(such as glycated hemoglobin and low-density lipopro\ufffetein levels) rather than in care processes (such as rates of \nlaboratory testing or use of antidepressant medications).7\nThis qualitative work suggests that the care process \nchanges were still nascent, and the care improvements \nmay not have been directly due to the CCM implemen\ufffetation. The quality measure improvements during the \nCCM change may also be taken as a hopeful sign that \nlong, diffi cult, and sometimes chaotic change processes \nare not incompatible with some advances in care quality.\nIt is particularly striking to compare the approaches \ntaken for this change effort with those taken for \nadvanced access 2 years earlier. At fi rst glance it looks \nas if the organization forgot the change lessons of \nits earlier successful transformation. The differences \nbecome more understandable, however, with the real\ufffeization that the 2 changes were qualitatively different, \nbeginning with care process designs, which differed \ncompletely in their level of action and ability. \nThe advanced access effort began with a more \nconcrete, prescriptive model ready for implementa\ufffetion, whereas the CCM effort had only an abstract \nconceptual framework that required up-front design \nof what was to be implemented and how to do it. The \nCCM change leaders also had to adjust to constrained \noptions because of the grant and other organizational \npriorities. As a result, their strategies changed several \ntimes as they worked to construct and fl esh out opera\ufffetional details of the CCM concept and its implementa\ufffetion. Clinic leaders then often had limited guidance \non what to do and how to do it. Although the medical \ngroup is known for its measurement savvy, meaningful \nmeasures and feedback mechanisms for the changes \nwere also diffi cult to develop. Much of the change \neffort aimed for endpoints in work relationships, where \nit appeared that measurable processes did not neces\ufffesarily translate into desired, measurable outcomes. \nMeasure development was also hampered at the time \nof the study by a limited understanding of the PDSA \nprocess in the clinics and by so few changes being \nsystemwide, and thus amenable to systemic measure\ufffement. This example highlights the difference between \ntheoretical ideals and practical realities. In an ideal \nworld, it might have been easier to separate EMR imple\ufffementation from PPT development. Leaders wondered in \nretrospect whether it would have been easier for clinics \nto be plunged into the interactive EMR from the start, \nrather than have it implemented in stages. But in the \nreal world, decisions must be made and action taken on \nthe basis of incomplete information. Regardless of how \nplanned any change may be, no one has the luxury of \nplanning its full context or its related contingencies free \nof other priorities. In addition, one structural change \nmay bring to the fore others needing to happen, as with \nthe problematic registries that led to staff work-arounds. \nThis example also raises questions about how best \nto use the conceptual framework, the Chronic Care \nModel, particularly in regard to the difference between \ncare process design and change implementation. After \ninitial efforts to educate clinic personnel in the overall \nframework clearly failed, organizational leaders turned \nfrom using the whole CCM to a few more-focused \nconcepts, especially PPTs. Although they developed \nsome role specifi cations for PPT members, individual \nteams and clinics had to work out their own details. \nWith no preexisting examples of effective teams, we \nobserved that the teams had limited effectiveness and \nundesirable variability. The main improvements came \nfrom those personnel most prepared for role expan\ufffesion, particularly nurses, who used the opportunity to \ndevelop their immediate care setting. \nAs a conceptual framework, the CCM is useful for \nthinking about the types of care processes needing to \nbe addressed. It was at best a vague guide to change, \nhowever; there were no specifi cs about the actual care \nprocess changes to be made and no description of the \nchange process needed to achieve them. In contrast, \nMurray and Tantau\u2019s detailed description of a more lim\ufffeited but still dramatic change in care process\u2014advanced \naccess\u2014does provide those operational specifi cs.14-16 In \naddition to a theoretical framework for thinking about \nthe problem, it specifi es what the new care model looks \nlike (>50% open appointments at the beginning of a day, \noffers of same-day service with one\u2019s personal clinician, \netc) and what changes are needed to get there (periodic \nmeasures of backlog and access, reduction in appoint\ufffement types, working down the backlog, \u201cmax-packing\u201d \nvisits). They also describe previous transformation \nexperiences and successful models. This information \n\nANNALS OF FAMILY MEDICINE \u2726 WWW.ANNFAMMED.ORG \u2726 VOL. 4, NO. 4 \u2726 JULY/AUGUST 2006\n325\nCHRONIC CARE MODEL IMPLEMENTATION\nallowed the medical group to successfully tailor its own \napproach to advanced access implementation (Table 3). \nEfforts to improve the quality of medical practice \nhave a long history, going back at least to the work of \nDr Ernest Codman in the 19th century.17 More recently, \nwe passed through the phase of quality assurance based \non the \u201cbad apple\u201d theory, and then to the continuous \nquality improvement model from industry.18 After some \nfalse starts in which there was too much emphasis on \nimproving particular processes using models that took \ntoo long and failed to involve leadership and address \nculture, we now seem to be developing more com\ufffeprehensive and rapid approaches that include physi\ufffecians.19 The research literature, however, has continued \nto focus almost entirely on studying interventions \nto change the behavior of individual physicians.20,21\nOnly recently are the 2 threads coming together in an \nunderstanding that real change requires applying qual\ufffeity improvement to change practice systems and using \norganizational change processes to do so.22-28\nSome of the lessons we draw from this large orga\ufffenization\u2019s effort to transform its care for patients with \nchronic conditions are as follows:\n1. Choose selective care processes that have been well \nworked out in similar settings, or devote time to careful \ndesign and piloting before tackling implementation.\n2. Use the CCM as a backdrop for leaders to under\ufffestand the relationships and roles of specifi c care changes \nneeded, not as the change blueprint or training model.\n3. Recognize and respect the diffi culty of changing \ntraditional care patterns. Organizational and professional \ncultures are critical to any change and require as much \nattention as the implementation, so fi rst understand and \nalign your organization\u2019s culture with the strategies being \nchosen.29 Attend to work relationships; when functioning \nwell, they should engage and empower all stakeholders \nto invest in and contribute to the changes.30\n4. Involve and engage physicians in both the care \nand change processes, or change will be stymied and \nthe impact on patient outcomes will be limited.\n5. Give individual clinics clear models and speci\ufffefi cations about the desired end, as well as latitude in \nhow they get there.\n6. Provide strong leadership vision, along with \nchange management skills, and ample resources at the \nlevel of both overall organization and individual clinics.\n7. Monitor closely what is going on, and adjust as \nchange barriers emerge. \n8. Focus, focus, focus! Large changes require strong \nprioritization and ongoing concentration of organiza\ufffetional attention, resources, time, and energies.\n9. Change takes time, probably twice as long as you \nthink. Pace the work, giving time and space for essen\ufffetial group learning and refl ection.31\n10. Allow for the unexpected. Complexity science \nsuggests that surprise is inherent in organizational \nchange, offering as much opportunity for learning and \ncreativity as threat of failure for those open to it.32,33\n11. Appreciate that concurrent organizational \nchanges may be unavoidable, even when it would be \nbetter to separate them.\nThis study is limited in being observational and \nincluding only a few clinics with varying change suc\ufffecess within one large care system. Interviews and clinic \nobservations were made at single points in a much \nlonger time span of changes. In addition, although the \noverall change effort was intended as implementation of \nthe CCM, it largely focused on the elements of delivery \nsystem design (PPTs) and on clinical information system \nchanges (EMR). This medical group\u2019s experience may be \nbest viewed as an exploration in organizational change. \nStudy credibility is enhanced by the research team\u2019s \nextensive experience in studying clinical practices and \nrelated organizational change. Key organizational leaders \nwere also engaged with this team to strengthen our data \ncollection and its iterative analysis. It is also important to \nnote that each member of the research team was familiar \nwith the CCM, had supported its use at least conceptu\ufffeally, and had research and/or leadership experience in \nchanging physician behavior. Three (LIS, JSH, MPM) \nhad some direct leadership involvement in this CCM \nimplementation effort. Two (MCH, BFC) approached the \nresearch from a cultural anthropology perspective. \nGeneralizability is tempered by studying a single, \nlarge health care system in a region in which managed \ncare and large health care organizations are widespread. \nClearly, this group differs in organizational complexity, \nleadership, and resources from the small practices pro\ufffeviding most of the primary care in the United States. \nAlthough the specifi cs of CCM use must be somewhat \nsite, system, and population dependent, our sense is \nthat the facilitators and barriers others might encoun\ufffeter in implementing the model would differ more in \ndegree than in kind. The lessons learned here are prob\ufffeably applicable for any medical group interested in the \nCCM, especially identifi cation of optimal PPT struc\ufffetures and function and optimal integration of the EMR. \nA more-detailed and specifi c care process and \nchange process for CCM implementation probably will \nbe required to achieve a higher stage of evolution and \nany major change in care delivery. The problems and \nneeds identifi ed here may partially explain why there \nare still so few examples of the successful care changes \ncalled for by the Institute of Medicine.\nEpilogue\nIn the 2 years since data for this study were collected, \nthe medical group has fully implemented its EMR and \n\nANNALS OF FAMILY MEDICINE \u2726 WWW.ANNFAMMED.ORG \u2726 VOL. 4, NO. 4 \u2726 JULY/AUGUST 2006\n326\nCHRONIC CARE MODEL IMPLEMENTATION\nmade considerable progress in delineating and apply\ufffeing its standardized, disease-neutral care model and \nthe visit cycle concept (previsit, visit, postvisit, and \nbetween-visit). This model continues to spread in pri\ufffemary care through clinic-wide collaborative learning \nsessions, and training has included leadership develop\ufffement. Physician engagement is being built into the \nEMR. Quality measures are starting to show increased \nimprovement, and leaders are cautiously optimistic that \nthe trend will continue.\nTo read or post commentaries in response to this article, see it \nonline at http://www.annfammed.org/cgi/content/full/4/4/317. \nKey words: Chronic disease; models, theoretical; organizational inno\ufffevation; physician\u2019s practice patterns; quality of health care\nSubmitted November 2, 2005; submitted, revised, March 15, 2006; \naccepted March 31, 2006.\nFunding support: This study was supported by grant # 041868 from \nThe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation through the Improving Chronic \nIllness Care Initiative.\nAcknowledgments: This medical group made large contributions to \nhealth care improvement in its willingness to share what it learned and \nits resources with others.

The authors analyzed the implementation process based on interviews and observations with organizational leaders, change leaders, and front-line providers in five clinics. They found that the implementation strategy involved medical group leaders specifying aim and strategies, which changed several times from 2002 to 2004. The implementation process began by focusing pilot work on a few clinics and then expanding to involve all clinics. The authors identified several barriers and facilitators to CCM implementation, such as resource constraints, lack of clarity regarding the CCM's condition-specific focus, and difficulty measuring the level of CCM implementation due to variability in component scores. The authors suggest that future research should explore ways to overcome these barriers and facilitate CCM implementation. Overall, the study highlights the importance of understanding the implementation process and identifying barriers and facilitators to inform policy decisions and future research.",

                "Both Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May \nhave recently expressed their support \nfor a change to the law in England to \nintroduce an opting-out system for organ \ndonation, and the Department of Health \nis consulting on the issue. This is based \non the assumption that it would make \na significant impact on the shortage of \norgans for transplantation and thus save \nhundreds of lives each year. It is a popular \nassumption, because the intention is so \nobviously well meaning. Sadly, though, it is \nan assumption that offers false hope.\nWOULD A CHANGE IN THE LAW \nINCREASE DECEASED DONATION?\nThere is no good evidence from anywhere \nin the world that a change in the law \nleads to a sustained increase in donation. \nIndeed, there are countries where in fact \ndonation has decreased, and Brazil offers \nperhaps the best example of this. The few \npublications that suggest a possible benefit \nhave important methodological flaws that \nmake it very difficult to isolate the impact \nof the law.1\n The evidence was reviewed in \ngreat detail as part of the second Organ \nDonation Taskforce report in 2008,2\n and \nlittle has changed since then. So what is \nthe basis for the assumption? There are at \nleast two important misunderstandings in \nthe case that are often made. First, there \nis the superficially attractive observation \nof the Spanish donation experience. Spain \nhas opting-out legislation and for many \nyears has had the highest donation rate in \nthe world. But the Spanish authorities have \nstated repeatedly that their \u2018success\u2019 does \nnot stem from the law.3\n Opting out was \nintroduced in Spain in 1979, with no apparent \neffect. Ten years later, in 1989, a national \ntransplant organisation was established \nwith a wide-ranging brief to transform the \ndonation system, based primarily on the \nemployment of medically qualified donor \ncoordinators in every hospital. The effects \nwere immediate, and Spain has led the way \nsince then. The Spanish model has been \nintroduced successfully in other regions and \ncountries, including northern Italy, Croatia, \nand Portugal. There were no changes in the \nlaw, but there were dramatic increases in \norgan donation as a result of nationally led \nchanges in clinical practice in intensive care \nunits (ICUs). Moreover, Spain does not in \nfact operate an opting-out system \u2014 there \nis no register for people to either opt in or \nopt out. As in England, consent for donation \nis explicit and comes either from the patient \nin life or through their family. \nThere is one other important factor \nrelevant to the Spanish success: different \ncountries have different numbers of \npotential donors. Very few patients die in \ncircumstances that allow organ donation \nto proceed (about one in a 100 in the \nUK). For clinical and practical reasons the \npatient must die from the \u2018right\u2019 diseases \n(that is, be free of transmissible agents \nsuch as cancer and significant infections), \nin the \u2018right\u2019 place (that is, in hospital \nand probably in an ICU), and in the \u2018right\u2019 \nway (that is, death must be, at least to \nsome extent, expected and predictable). \nMost donors have suffered a catastrophic \nbrain injury from intracerebral bleeding, \ntrauma, or hypoxia, and have been treated \nin intensive care. For many years Spain has \nhad between two and three times as many \nICU beds per capita compared with the UK. \nDifferent resources and approaches to end\ufffeof-life care result in different numbers of \npotential donors \u2014 and therefore of actual \ndonors.\nSecond, a common misunderstanding \nis that under current opt-in legislation \u2018in \norder to be a donor you have to have opted \nin, by joining the NHS Organ Donor Register \n(ODR)\u2019. Because only 36% of the population \nhave signed up there is a false belief that \nthe other 64% will never be donors, because \nthey haven\u2019t opted in. In fact, in the UK last \nyear the families of almost all brain dead \npotential donors were approached about \ndonation,4\n regardless of whether the patient \nwas registered on the ODR. Certainly \nregistration is to be encouraged as it makes \nit so much easier for the family to know \ntheir relative\u2019s wishes, but it is absolutely \nnot a requirement. Over 90% of families \nnow agree to donation when the patient \nwas registered but about 70% agree even \nwhen the patient was not registered. The \nsuggestion that opting out would somehow \nadd the \u2018missing\u2019 64% of the population to \nthe donor pool is quite wrong \u2014 in practice, \nthey are there already.\nThe only experience of opting out in the \nUK comes from Wales, where legislation \nfor what is called \u2018deemed consent\u2019 was \nintroduced in December 2015. Although this \nstill allows a role for the patient\u2019s family, \nthis is limited to providing information \nabout the patient\u2019s wishes, and the family\u2019s \nattitude to donation should not be relevant. \nThe numbers are small and it is premature \nto draw conclusions but in the first full year \nafter the new law was introduced donor \nnumbers were almost unchanged, while in \nthe first 6 months of the second year they \nhave fallen (on an annualised basis) by 14% \n(compared with a rise of 9% in England in \nthe same time period).5\nIS OPTING OUT A \u2018BETTER\u2019 FORM OF \nCONSENT?\nThere are also ethical and practical \nconcerns about a change to the law. Opting\ufffeout laws cover a spectrum but are usually \ndescribed as either \u2018hard\u2019 or \u2018soft\u2019. Under a \nhard system organs will be removed after \ndeath if the individual has not opted out, and \nthe family have no role. It is this system that \nleads to the frequently heard objection that \nthe state is taking over the person\u2019s body \nafter death, and there are major ethical \nconcerns. Consent is an active process that \ncannot be \u2018presumed\u2019 simply because no \nobjection is known. It is not clear that such \na system would be acceptable to intensive \ncare clinicians, who play such a vital role in \nthe care of potential donors. Under a soft \nsystem there is a presumption in favour \nof donation but the family have the final \nsay. Ethically this is far less troublesome. \nHowever, it is not always apparent that \nthe media and the public are aware of \nthe differences between a hard and a soft \nsystem, and the widespread objection to the \nformer may have an adverse effect on the \npossible acceptability of the latter, and so \nhave an adverse impact on donation.\nARE THERE ANY ALTERNATIVES?\nSo if opting out is not the solution, what \nis? For nearly 20 years the UK had a \npoor record in organ donation, and the \nOrgan donation:\nopting in or opting out?\nEditorials\n62 British Journal ofGeneralPractice, February 2018\n\u201cThe need for more organs for transplantation \nis pressing, but there seems to be little merit in \npursuing a change in the law \u2026\u201d\n\nnumbers were falling from the start of \nthis century. In 2008 the Organ Donation \nTaskforce report was published6\n with a \nseries of recommendations that have all \nbeen implemented. They have transformed \nthe donation system and overall donor \nnumbers have increased by over 70% since \nthen, and continue to do so \u2014 at least \nin England.7\n Key to this transformation \nhas been tremendous work by intensive \ncare clinicians and the specialist nurses \nwho work with them, combined with \ncentral support from a national donation \norganisation, NHS Blood and Transplant. \nFundamental to this has been the move \nto recognise donation as being in the best \ninterests of an individual who had wished \nto be a donor rather than seeing potential \norgan donors simply as a source of organs \nfor someone else \u2014 autonomy rather than \nutilitarianism, if you like. These results \nare spectacular but everyone concerned \nknows that there is much more that can \nand should be done \u2014 and they are working \nhard to do it.\nThese results speak for themselves \nand more of the same would seem to \nbe an excellent policy. GPs and practice \nnurses can play a valuable role by including \norgan donation in any discussions about \na patient\u2019s end-of-life wishes and by \npromoting the Organ Donor Register \nalongside other public health issues (\u2018stop \nsmoking, lose weight, and join the Organ \nDonor Register\u2019). The need for more organs \nfor transplantation is pressing, but there \nseems to be little merit in pursuing a change \nin the law that appears to revert to the \nutilitarian approach that is now discredited \nand is unproven, controversial, expensive, \nethically questionable, and possibly risky.\nChris J Rudge CBE,\nNational Clinical Director for Transplantation 2008\u2013\n2011 and Retired Consultant Transplant Surgeon \n(Royal London Hospital).\nProvenance\nCommissioned; not externally peer reviewed.\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgp18X694445\nADDRESS FOR CORRESPONDENCE\nChris J Rudge\nFawkham, Kent, UK.\nE-mail:cjrudge@btinternet.com \nREFERENCES\n1.

            "response": "This research paper explores the impact of innovations and policies related to organ donation in various countries. It highlights that both Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May have proposed changing the law to introduce an opting-out system for organ donation in England, assuming it would significantly increase the number of donations and save hundreds of lives annually. However, the paper argues that there is no strong evidence supporting this claim, as countries with opting-out systems, such as Spain, attribute their high donation rates to other factors, such as a nationwide change in clinical practices in intensive care units. Additionally, the paper notes that under current opt-in legislation, families of brain-dead potential donors are still approached about donation regardless of registration status, and most families agree to donate, regardless of registration. The paper suggests that alternatives to changing the law, such as increasing awareness of organ donation and promoting the Organ Donor Register, could be more effective in increasing donations. Overall, the paper concludes that changing the law to an opting-out system appears utilitarian, ethically questionable, and potentially risky, without sufficient evidence of its effectiveness.",

We\nhave analysed the long-term cardiac and neurological outcomes of\npatients with cardiac rhabdomyomas in order to allow\ncomprehensive prenatal counselling, basing our findings on the\nrecords of all patients seen prenatally and postnatally with an\n\n\nechocardiographic diagnosis of cardiac rhabdomyoma encountered\nfrom August, 1982, to September, 2007. We analysed factors such\nas the number and the location of the tumours to establish their\nassociation with a diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis, predicting the\ncardiac and neurologic outcomes for the patients.\nCardiac complications include arrhythmias, obstruction of the\nventricular outflow tracts, and secondary cardiogenic shock.\nArrhythmias were encountered most often during the neonatal\nperiod, with supraventricular tachycardia being the commonest\nrhythm disturbance identified. No specific dimension or location of\nthe cardiac rhabdomyomas predicted the disturbances of rhythm.\nThe importance of the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis is exemplified\nby the neurodevelopmental complications, with four-fifths of the\npatients showing epilepsy, and two-thirds having delayed\ndevelopment. The presence of multiple cardiac tumours suggested a\nhigher risk of being affected by tuberous sclerosis. The tumours\ngenerally regress after birth, and cardiac-related problems are rare\nafter the perinatal period. Tuberous sclerosis and the associated\nneurodevelopmental complications dominate the clinical picture,\nand should form an important aspect of the prenatal counselling of\nparents.\nKeywords\nCardiac tumourfetusoutcometuberous sclerosis\nInformation\nType\nOriginal Articles\nInformation\nCardiology in the Young , Volume 20 , Issue 1 , February\n2010 , pp. 18 - 24\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S1047951109992046 [Opens\nin a new window]\n\n\nCopyright\nCopyright \u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2010\nAccess options\nGet access to the full version of this content by using one of the\naccess options below.

                "PLoS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org 0448\n Essay \nApril 2006 | Volume 3 | Issue 4 | e146\nThe challenge of combating the \ncurrent epidemic of disease \nmongering is daunting, and \nanyone looking for ready solutions \nshould read no further. Those seeking \na way forward fi nd themselves ranged \nagainst powerful economic, political, \nand professional interests. There is \nan apparently limitless amount of \nmoney to be made from marketing \npharmaceutical remedies for diseases \nand even more from remedies to \nreduce risk factors for disease. An \nemphasis on the treatment of disease \nminimises political responsibility for \nthose fundamental causes of disease \nthat are located within the structure of \nsociety, and substantial and lucrative \nprofessional careers have been built on \nthe endless pursuit of new diseases or \nrisk factors for disease. \nMore fundamentally, disease \nmongering exploits the deepest \natavistic fears of suffering and death. \nThroughout history, humanity has \nkept such fears at bay by accepting \nburdens and sacrifi ces in the present \nin the hope of future salvation. \nIn earlier times, the mediator was \nreligion and the salvation was to come \nafter death. Now, for those without \nreligious belief, death has become \nmore fi nal, and salvation must be \nsought before death in an ever\ufffeexpanding longevity. An adequate \nresponse to the false hopes raised \nby disease mongering will demand, \nfrom those in positions of power and \ninfl uence, an ability to acknowledge, \naccommodate, and move beyond these \nprofound existential fears [1]. Such \nability is rare.\nThe way forward will rely on a \ncapacity to rediscover courage and \nstoicism as both private and civic \nvirtues, alongside seeking a radical \nrealignment of the relationship \nbetween economic, political, and \nprofessional interests. Doctors and \nbiomedical scientists, in particular, \nhave a responsibility not only to put \ntheir own house in order but to provide \nmuch better advice to politicians and \nto the public, both as patients and as \ncitizens.\n The Challenge to Professionals\nThe fi rst step has to be a genuine \ndisentanglement of the medical \nprofession from the pharmaceutical \nindustry\u2014there really is no such thing \nas a free lunch [2]. The pharmaceutical \nindustry spends millions of dollars \nsupporting the \u201ceducation\u201d of doctors \nbecause it is in its economic interest \nto do so (Figure 1). If prescribing \nactivities and industry profi ts were \nnot affected by this support, it would \nnot be offered. Doctors can only \nprovide appropriately independent \nand authentic advice to patients and, \nindeed, to politicians if they are seen \nto be completely independent of other \npowerful interests. Politicians genuinely \ninterested in the welfare of patients and \nthe health of citizens should actively \npromote such independence [4].\nBeyond this, there is a need for \nbetter science that has the integrity to \ndemand more explicit acknowledgment \nof the limits of medical knowledge, \nless extrapolation beyond research \nfi ndings, and much more responsible \nuse of statistics, so that the true extent \nof the benefi ts and harms of proposed \ntreatments can be properly understood. \nThe rhetoric surrounding disease \nmongering suggests that it will promote \nhealth, but the effect is in fact the \nopposite. Much disease mongering \nrelies on the pathologising of normal \nbiological or social variation and on \nthe portrayal of the presence of risk \nfactors for disease as a disease state in \nitself. When pharmaceuticals are used \nto treat risk factors, the vicious circle is \ncompleted because \u201canyone who takes \nmedicines is by defi nition a patient\u201d [5]. \nMost variables are distributed \nacross a continuum, but despite this, \nthe medical tradition has been to \ndichotomise the continuum into normal \nand abnormal [6]. Within a continuum, \nthere can never be a clear boundary, \nso the defi nition of disease is inevitably \nboth arbitrary and fl uid. It is in the \ninterests of pharmaceutical companies \nto extend the range of the abnormal \nso that the market for treatments is \nproportionately enlarged. We have seen \nthis process operating, for example, in \nthe continual lowering of thresholds \nfor treatment of blood pressure and \nlipids\u2014the most recent guidelines from \nthe European Society of Cardiology \ncan be used to identify 76% of the total \nadult population of a county of Norway \nas being at \u201cincreased risk\u201d [7].\nWe need to reverse this situation so \nthat instead of defi ning an arbitrary \nthreshold of abnormality, governments \n Combating Disease Mongering: \nDaunting but Nonetheless Essential \nIona Heath\n Funding: The author received no specifi c funding for \nthis article. \n Competing Interests: The author has declared that \nno competing interests exist.\n Citation: Heath I (2006) Combating disease \nmongering: Daunting but nonetheless essential.

In this paper, \nhe showed that risk factors for health \nare almost always distributed across a \nbell curve and argued that more could \nbe achieved by attempting to shift \nthe whole of the bell curve than by \ntargeting those at highest risk (Figure \n2). His rationale was that the large \nnumber of people at low risk may give \nrise to more cases of disease than the \nsmall number who are at high risk. \nThere has been general acceptance of \nthis argument, but Rose\u2019s own warnings \nseem to have been lost. \nRose was careful to list the \ndisadvantages of attempting to shift the \nwhole bell curve, which included (1) a \n\u201cworrisome\u201d benefi t\u2013risk ratio (there \nis only a small possibility of benefi t \nfor any one individual, but everyone \nis exposed to the intervention and \nthereby to any adverse effects, such as \nmedicalisation, anxiety, and side effects \nof treatments) and (2) poor motivation \non the part of individual patients, each \nof whom had a very small chance of \nbenefi t. These predicted disadvantages \nhave become more and more apparent, \nso there has been a systematic attempt \nto improve motivation through the \nexplicit use of fear, which in itself \nerodes and undermines health. \u201cIf \nyou don\u2019t take more exercise, improve \nyour diet or take this medication, \nyou actively put yourself at risk of an \nuntimely death.\u201d\nRose was also very careful to \ndistinguish between two approaches to \nshifting the bell curve. The fi rst restores \nbiological normality by preventing \nexposure to hazards such as tobacco \nsmoke or industrial air pollution. \nThe second approach is to interpose \nsome new, supposedly protective \nintervention, but this is much less \nrobust because it leaves the underlying \ncauses intact. The current use of \npharmaceuticals for public health \npolicy falls into this category. As more \nand more risk factors are identifi ed, \nclosely followed by a pharmaceutical \ntreatment for each, the ambition to \nshift the whole bell curve legitimises \nthe wholesale drug treatment of \nhealthy populations at vast expense \nand with huge pharmaceutical profi ts. \nThere is a clear need to reiterate Rose\u2019s \ndistinction and prioritise the reduction \nof exposure to biological hazards above \nthe application of pharmaceutical \nprophylaxis.\nCurrent trends raise the prospect of \nexponential spending on preventive \npharmaceuticals, justifi ed by potential \nlong-term benefi ts to an unidentifi able, \nbut statistically signifi cant, number \nof people in the population. When \ndoctors treat patients with diseases, \nprogress can be assessed and the \noutcome is measurable. This means \nthat if the patient responds to \ntreatment, it can be continued; if \nnot, the treatment can be stopped. \nWhen doctors treat people who are \nmerely at risk of disease, the outcome \nis probabilistic, so whether disease \nis prevented or was never going to \ndevelop, the treatment continues \nindefi nitely [9].\nShifting the bell curve through \npopulation-based interventions aimed \nat protecting health is part of a long \nand magnifi cent tradition which began \nwhen John Snow capped the Broad \nStreet pump; shifting the bell curve \nthrough the mass pharmaceutical \ntreatment of individuals turns out to \nbe something quite different. Further, \nwhere individualised solutions become \nprevalent, societal, population-based \ninterventions tend to fall away, and the \nresult is worsening health inequalities.\nThe medical profession needs to \ndo much more to defi ne sensible \nlimits to medical intervention. There \nis a clear and urgent need for more \nresearch into the psychological impact \nand the wider health consequences of \nbeing labelled \u201cat risk\u201d [10]. Doctors, \nand society as a whole, need to stop \nconfusing health with happiness [11]. \nThis confusion is at the root of much \nof the medicalisation of normal human \nvariation that we are witnessing. Male \npattern baldness and shyness, to take \njust two examples, are not diseases \nbut normal parts of the range of \nhuman experience. We are witnessing \ndiagnostic drift in a whole range of \nconditions, from depression [12] to \nhypertension [13], with pressure for \nmore and more people to be included \nwithin the range of abnormal and \noffered treatment. The justifi cation \nfor these treatments is often based \non short-term studies, which are \nthen extrapolated over much longer \ntime periods. There is insuffi cient \nrecognition of the fact that the less \nthe need for treatment, the higher \nthe number needed to treat for given \noutcomes and the higher the risk \nto patients, since the rate of adverse \neffects remains constant.\n The Challenge to Politicians\nPoliticians are charged with overseeing \nthe organisation of society for the \nbenefi t of all. A major political \nachievement of Western societies, \nwith the very notable exception \nof the United States, has been the \nprovision of universal health-care \nsystems available and accessible to \nall. There is now a pressing need \nfor politicians to recognise the \nthreat to these systems, and to the \nsocial solidarity that they embody, \nposed by exponential increases in \npharmaceutical expenditure. No \nuniversal health-care system funded by \ntaxation can pay for the pharmaceutical \ntreatment of all risks to health. There \nare very diffi cult decisions to be made, \nbut politicians must balance the wish \nto support a vibrant and innovative \nDOI: 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030146.g001\n Figure 1.

The costs of \nhealth care are highest during the year \nbefore death, regardless of the age at \nwhich death occurs. Everyone must die \nand be cared for while dying, and no \namount of preventive pharmaceuticals \ncan reduce the cost of providing this \ncrucial end-of-life care [14]. The aim \nof preventive health care should be \nthe reduction of untimely deaths in \nrelatively young people, but the fear \nof accusations of ageism in health care \nmeans that doctors are encouraged \nto go on prescribing preventive \npharmaceuticals to people well into \ntheir late eighties and nineties [15]. \nIn any system of health care \npredicated on social solidarity, the \nrights of individuals to treatment have \nto be balanced against the duties of \ncitizens to provide the appropriate \nlevel of funding. Citizens agree to pay \ntax for the care of those who are sick, \nwith the understanding that they, too, \nwill be cared for should they, in turn, \nbecome sick. It remains unclear how far \nthis pact of social solidarity extends to \npaying for the treatment of risk factors \nand marginal \u201cdiseases\u201d, where the \nbenefi ts in terms of reducing suffering \nare much less clear. Publicly funded \npreventive treatment of risk factors \nfor those who have already exceeded \nthe average life expectancy seems \nparticularly hard to justify.\nSocioeconomic deprivation has \nbeen described as a \u201cfundamental \ncause\u201d of disease, which works \nthrough a multiplicity of risk factors \nand pathophysiological pathways \nto produce multiple disease states \n[16]. Even if one of these pathways \nis interrupted by the application of a \npreventive technology, an association \nbetween a fundamental cause and \ndisease will reappear in a different \nform. The closer to the individual the \nintervention is situated, the less likely \nthe improvement in health status is to \nbe maintained. \nIn mental health problems, we see \nthis process operating when people \nare helped to cope with poor housing \nand lack of rewarding employment \nthrough the provision of counselling, \nrather than better social conditions. \nPopulation-based interventions favour \nthe poor because such interventions \nare applied universally and the poor \nare the most at-risk; individually \nbased interventions favour the rich \nbecause they are more likely to make \nuse of what is offered. For this reason, \npopulation approaches to tackling the \nfundamental causes of socioeconomic \ndeprivation must remain the most \neffective way of tackling health \ninequalities [17]. However, there is also \na continuing role for individually based \ntreatment of those at the highest risk \nof particular diseases, but this must be \neffectively targeted if inequalities are \nnot to be exacerbated. \nAge is another fundamental cause of \ndisease, less remediable than poverty \nbut again generating multiple risk \nfactors and multiple disease outcomes. \nAll clinicians are familiar with the \nprocesses by which treating one disease \nin a frail, older person will often mean \nthat symptoms reappear through \nanother pathway. Authentic health care \nfor the old and frail has much more \nto do with helping to preserve their \ndignity, treating them with affection, \nand supporting their continued \ninvolvement in social activities, rather \nthan the pursuit of ever-more elusive \ncures. Politicians have a responsibility, \nalongside doctors and many others, to \nmake such care available, and this in \nitself will be an important part of the \nway forward. \nThe huge amount of money \nthat can be made from preventive \ntechnologies has diminished the \neconomic importance of treatment \ntechnologies, particularly for those \nillnesses that primarily affect poorer \npeople in poorer countries [18]. This \nhas meant a shift of attention from \nthe sick to the well and from the poor \nto the rich [19]. This effect of global \nmarkets requires a response in the \nform of an assertion of global human \nsolidarity. Health inequalities matter \nglobally as well as locally. A way forward \nmight be through taxation or other \nmeans, to make the sale of preventive \ntechnologies in countries with above\ufffeaverage expectation of life conditional \non the availability of treatment for \nthose diseases that cause the most \ncatastrophic shortening of life in poor \ncountries. \n Conclusion\nHuman societies are riven by the effects \nof greed and fear. The rise of preventive \nhealth technologies has opened up \na new arena of human greed, which \nresponds to an enduring fear. The \ngreed is for ever-greater longevity; the \nfear is that of dying. The irony and the \ntragedy is that the greed infl ates the \nfear and poisons the present in the \nname of a better, or at least a longer, \nfuture. Ultimately, the only way of \ncombating disease mongering is to \nvalue the manner of our living above \nthe timing of our dying. \u0001 \nDOI: 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030146.g002 \n Figure 2.

With a large pool of patients, longer follow-up \nperiods, and an affordable cost, such studies can address broader \nresearch questions with deeper insights. Such study designs also \nhold inherent limitations, such as selection bias (e.g., certain \ngroups of patients are more likely to access a certain therapy) \nand confounding (e.g., the observed treatment effect might mix \nwith the effects of other important prognostics factors that are \nimbalanced among treatment arms). It is believed that through \nthoughtful design, careful analysis, accurate interpretation, \nand transparent reporting, a sound scientific conclusion can be \nreached with minimized limitations5\u20137\n. However, even when well \nequipped with the concepts of good research practice8\u201312, a \nresearcher holding a promising hypothesis with access to an excel\ufffelent data source may face many challenges. They may include \na lack of understanding of the full extent of the massive data \nand its feasibility to answer the study question(s); the complex\ufffeity of the data on hand; the need for tediously repetitive and \ntime-consuming data processing; lack of transparency in data \nprocessing and reporting; or miscommunication among col\ufffelaborators with mixed levels of experience and expertise. The \nmain motivation of this work is to illustrate generic research and \nanalytic framework for studies based on an observational data\ufffebase, to emphasize the importance of routine data analysis, \nand to introduce a series of SAS\u00ae macros13 designed to aid the \njourney of research with ease and efficiency.\nIn the following section, we illustrate how the proposed \nSAS\u00ae macros fit into the research and analytic framework seam\ufffelessly and assist in improving the overall research quality. In \nthe case study, we exemplify the usage of the proposed macros \nby a real-life research project based on the NCDB with detailed \nresult interpretations and discussion.\nMethods\nA general analytic workflow in observational studies\nA general process of conducting research based on observational/\nretrospective studies involves a few general steps: study design, \ndata management, data analyses, and reporting/review (shown in \nFigure 1), and each step interacts with each other as research is \nrefined over time.\nFigure 1.

At the study design phase, the primary study goals or \nhypotheses need to be stated clearly with a suitable \ndatabase along with proper definitions of study population, \noutcomes, cohorts, and covariates. A comprehensive \nliterature review in the area further assists a better study \ndesign.\n2. The data management step includes crafting the target \nstudy population by applying exclusion/inclusion criteria \nand preparing variables, such as creating derived variables, \ncategorizing continuous variables, collapsing levels in \ncategorical variables, handling missing values and outliers, \netc. We recommend to assign an interpretable label and \nformat to each variable for the best readable output table \nfrom the macros.\n3. In the data analyses step, different layers of information \nabout the data will be unfolded by sequential analytic \nsteps to test ultimate study hypotheses. The routine data \nanalyses, followed by more advanced analytic approaches, \nallow for building a pyramid of evidence to support \nhypotheses and hence strengthen study conclusions.\n4. At the phase of reporting/review, we wrap up all results with \ninterpretations in the context of the scientific background to \nevaluate the findings and draw conclusions with a statement \nof limitations. The process may involve reviews from an \ninternal collaborative group or criticisms from journal \nreviews. There is some helpful guidance out there for \nreporting results from an observational study7,11. \nThe research itself should be dynamic and iterative as illustrated \nin Figure 1. Any issues, questions, criticisms, or new ideas that \narise at a given step will redirect us to the previous steps and \nmay lead to modifications of or additions to the original study \ndesign. The proposed SAS\u00ae macros will fit into this research \nframework seamlessly by covering routine data analyses in Step 3 \nmore efficiently and enhancing reporting and communication \nin Step 4.\nThe routine data analyses serve as the foundational knowl\ufffeedge to support final claims in the research. The lack of correct \nperception or understanding of the importance of routine data \nanalyses can lead researchers to rush into the final results with\ufffeout seeing the holes in the foundation, losing opportunities for \nimprovement, and drawing biased conclusions. 1) For descrip\ufffetive analyses, we get a chance to review the landscape of the \nentire study population and know the boundaries that apply to \nthe conclusion. For example, if the study population is 99.9% \nCaucasian and 0.1% African American, the research findings \nmay not be generalizable to the African American population or \nother racial groups. In addition, descriptive analyses help us to \nassess missing data, outliers, or possible data entry errors; and \nlead to additional data management. 2) For univariate associations \nor modeling, a natural association without any adjustment in the \nrelationship between study cohorts and covariates or between \noutcome and cohorts/covariates will be demonstrated. We will \nlearn of differences in patients\u2019 characteristics among comparison \ncohorts, which may explain the differences we observe in \nthe associations with the outcomes, especially when those \ncharacteristics are strong predictors of the outcomes. The \nphenomenon is referred to as selection bias or confounding, \nas commonly seen in observational studies. A confounder can \nbe identified conceptually through existing knowledge or by \nexamining the univariate associations as described here. \n3) Both multivariable analyses and subgroup analyses are ways \nto deal with the confounding effects. Multivariable analyses are \nalso known as main effects models which estimate an adjusted \nassociation with the outcome for each variable assuming all \nother variables are held constant in the model. The main effects \nmodel assumes the adjusted association with the outcome for each \nvariable is uniformly constant across the levels of all other vari\ufffeables in the model. When such an assumption does not hold, sub\ufffegroup analyses can be applied, known as interaction models, by \nwhich the association with the outcome is allowed to vary by \nthe levels of a third variable (effect modifiers). Deeper technique \ndetails and strategies for multivariable modeling and variable \nselection, or more advanced approaches, such as propensity \nscore methods, can be found in statistical textbooks or \nliteratures14,15.\nSAS\u00ae macros\nSAS\u00ae macros are powerful tools and have been used widely \nto build customized SAS\u00ae procedures to reduce repetitive cod\ufffeing. Many individual SAS\u00ae macros were created for reporting \npurposes16\u201318, but only suit very specific scenarios, and none \nof them cover a streamlined data analyses to truly serve the \nresearch generically and dynamically, as the proposed macros do.\nImplementation\nThe basic mechanism is similar in all proposed macros:\n1. Process each variable in the list of interest or each \nanalytic step one at a time, and continue such iteration \nuntil the last variable or step.\n2. Inside each iteration, related SAS\u00ae exsiting procedures \nare carried out and the relevant and key information from \nthe output is exported into SAS\u00ae datasets using ODS \nOUTPUT option.\n3.

Also, it results in readable \nand concise SAS code, and enables easier maintenance and \nrevisions as the project evolves.\nUse case\nBackground\nThe traditional surgical approach for early-stage lung cancer is \nvia a thoracotomy, and such open chest surgery is limited to \ncertain eligible patients due to the increased risk of mortality, \nespecially among elderly patients with multiple comorbidities. \nOver the past two decades, video-assisted thoracic surgery \n(VATS) has been increasingly used in clinics and provides excel\ufffelent short-term advantages over thoracotomy, such as fewer com\ufffeplications, less pain, improved lung function, shorter recovery \nperiod and lower costs. On the other hand, incomplete lymph \nnode evaluation with VATS or a high rate of the residual tumor \nmay compromise the long-term efficacy of VATS vs. thoracot\ufffeomy (open). The knowledge uncertainty still exists regarding the \noptimal surgical approach for early-stage lung cancer concern\ufffeing long-term survival20. The goal of this study is to compare \nthe overall survival (OS) between two surgical approaches \namong the target eligible lung cancer patients.\nThe National Cancer Database (NCDB)2\n, a joint project of the \nAmerican Cancer Society and the Commission on Cancer of the \nAmerican College of Surgeons, was queried for non-small cell \nlung cancer patients with clinical stage < T2N0M0 who under\ufffewent lobectomy in 2010-2013. After applying the exclusion/\ninclusion criteria, we identified 34,048 eligible patients. The study \ncohort is the surgical approach (open vs. minimally invasive). \nThe clinical outcomes of interest were 30-day mortality after \nsurgery (yes vs. no) and overall survival (OS): defined as \nmonths from the date of surgery to death or last follow up. \nCovariates considered included sex, Charlson-Deyo score \n(comorbidity), year of diagnosis, histology, AJCC clinic T \nstage, age at diagnosis and urban/rural 2003. For a detailed \ndefinition of these variables, users can refer to the online data \ndictionary (http://ncdbpuf.facs.org/node/259?q=print-pdf-all).\nIn this case study, we show sequential analytical steps along \nwith interpretations to probe into the study question by \nusing the proposed SAS\u00ae macros. To make it easy to fol\ufffelow, we only include a short but relevant list of variables and \ncover routine data analyses. A comprehensive and complete \nmanuscript for the study question is under preparation for \na peer-reviewed publication.\nSAS\u00ae macros showcase \u2013 data analyses\nPlease note that these macros do not handle data cleaning or \nmanagement directly. For the most interpretable results, it is \nhighly recommended to properly format and label each variable \nbefore running these macros. All output tables are in Rich Text \nFormat (RTF) and editable in Word.\nDescriptive Statistics\nThe macro %DESCRIPTIVE was used to generate Table 1. \nThe table provides an overview of the study population\u2019s basic \ncharacteristics, in which the frequency and proportion are \nlisted for categorical covariates and summary statistics (mean, \nmedian, min, max, standard deviation) for numerical covari\ufffeates, along with the frequency of missing values. In the fol\ufffelowing SAS\u00ae code example, a few universal macro variables \nare implemented: DATASET for the data set name; CLIST for \na list of categorical covariates separated by space; NLIST for \na list of continuous covariates separated by spaces; OUTPATH\nfor the file path to store the output RTF file; FNAME for the \nname of the RTF file; DEBUG to suppress deleting interme\ufffediate data sets for error checking by setting to T. Setting the \nDICTIONARY option to T creates two additional columns in \nthe summary table, for the covariates\u2019 SAS\u00ae names and unformat\ufffeted values. These columns are useful for the programmer to con\ufffenect the table with the dataset and code. In Table 1, we observe \nthat 35.6% of the study population underwent a minimally inva\ufffesive surgical approach, 45% were male, 80.9% resided in a metro \narea, and 85.4% had comorbidity score \u22641.\n******** SAS\u00ae code example for %DESCRIPTIVE ********;\n/* TIP 1: Create the macro variable &DIR to specify the loca\ufffetion used to store all results.

Compared to open surgical patients, minimally inva\ufffesive surgical patients were more likely to reside in metro areas \n(84.2% vs. 79.1%), to be diagnosed in recent years, to have a \nhistology of adenocarcinomas (64.5% vs. 60.2%), and to be at \nclinical T stage 1 (70.5% vs. 64.5%) (all p < 0.001). In \nTable 3, the factors associated with a higher risk of 30-day \nmortality after surgery were having open surgery (OR = 1.48), \nmale gender (OR = 2.16), older age (OR = 1.06 for every \n1-year increase), a comorbidity score larger than one (OR = 1.8 \ncompared to score = 0), squamous cell carcinomas (OR = 2.49 \ncompared to adenocarcinomas), and clinical T stage 2 (OR = 1.34) \n(all p < 0.001). By interpreting the information in Table 2 and \nTable 3 together, the univariate association between surgical type \nand 30-day mortality could be confounded by the effect from his\ufffetology and clinical T stage. Open surgery was more likely to be \nconducted among patients who had squamous cell carcinomas \nand clinical T2, and these two factors were linked to a higher \nrate of 30-day mortality. The observed higher probability of \n30-day mortality in open surgery patients might be partially \ndue to the imbalanced distribution of histology and clinical T \nstage in the surgical cohorts.

In the follow\ufffeing SAS\u00ae code example, the survival time variable is specified \nin EVENT, and the censoring indicator variable in CENSOR. \nNote that it requires that \u20181\u2019 is used for the event and \u20180\u2019 for the \ncensored cases in the data (DATASET). Other options include \nLOGRANK to output log-rank p-value, TYPE3 to output the \nType3 p-values for categorical covariates, and PHA for propor\ufffetional hazard assumption checks. Similar to %UNI_LOGREG,\none can set the reference level of a categorical covariate in \nCLIST. %UNI_PHREG can also handle time to event data \nin the counting process data form by using the START and \nSTOP options, especially when modeling data with time-varying \ncovariates or recurrent event data. It can also handle competing \nrisk data by using the EVENTCODE option to activate the Fine \nand Gray\u2019s model21.\nIn the univariate analysis shown in Table 4, we see that patients \nwho underwent open surgery had 18% more chance to die before \nthose who underwent minimally invasive surgery (HR = 1.18; \n95%CI = (1.13-1.24); p < 0.001). Also, residing in rural or urban \nareas, higher comorbidity scores, squamous cell carcinomas, clini\ufffecal stage T2, and older age were all risk factors linked to worse \noverall survival in this study population. In combination with the \nresults in Table 2, those prognostic factors except for age were \nalso more likely to present in patients who underwent open \nsurgery and should be controlled for as confounders in \nmultivariable analyses.\n************ SAS\u00ae code example for %UNI_PHREG and its \noptions *****************;\nTITLE \u2018Table 4 Univariate association with Overall Survival\u2019;\n%UNI_PHREG (\nDATASET = anal,\nEVENT = os_surg,\nCENSOR = os_censor,\nPage 10 of 21\nF1000Research 2019, 7:1955 Last updated: 14 NOV 2024\n\nCLIST = surg_app * &cat_var_ref,\nNLIST = &num_var,\nLOGRANK = F,\nTYPE3 = T,\nPHA = F,\nOUTPATH = &dir,\nFNAME = Table 4 Univariate association with Overall \nSurvival);\nTITLE;\n****************************************************;\nMultivariable model for the binary or time-to-event outcome\nWe performed multivariable analysis with a logistic regression \nmodel for the 30-day mortality outcome using %LOGREG_\nSEL (Table 5) and a Cox proportional hazards model for overall \nsurvival using %PHREG_SEL (Table 6). The adjusted associa\ufffetion of the surgical approaches with the two clinical outcomes was \nestimated after controlling for observed confounding variables. \nThe odds ratio and hazard ratio were reported along with 95% \nCI and p-values. In both macros, a manual backward elimination \nprocedure was implemented by dropping one variable at a time \nuntil all variables left satisfied a pre-specified alpha level \n(e.g., SLSTAY = 0.1). The selection process in the macros allows \nthe sample size to adjust and always uses the maximum avail\ufffeable sample as the number of variables in the model drops, which \ndiffers from the automatic selection procedure built into PROC \nLOGISTIC or PROC PHREG, where a complete and fixed data \nset is used throughout the selection procedure. In the following\nexample code, DSN is for specifying the data set name, and \nEVENT in %LOGREG_SEL is to specify the event of interest, \nfor which the probability will be modeled. VAR is for the list of all \nvariables or terms in the initial model, separated by a space. CVAR\nis for the list of the categorical variables in VAR with the option \nto specify reference levels as shown in Table 4. INC = k is set to \nprotect the first k variables in VAR from being eliminated, such \nas a primary exploratory variable and important confounding vari\ufffeables. In this case study, we want to keep surgical approach in the \nmodel as it is the study cohort, which was done by putting surg_\napp on the first position in VAR and setting INC = 1. Setting \nCLNUM = T outputs the frequency of categorical variables \nin the final model. The summary information of the selection \nprocedure was presented in the footnote of the final report table. \nA separate macro for multivariable analysis of competing risk \ndata is %FINEGRAY_SEL.

If a user wants to customize the \nmodel building process, they can use these two macros for report\ufffeing purposes only by setting VAR = final model variables selected \nby other approaches and INC = total number of items in the \nfinal model.\nIn Table 5, the backward elimination drops clinical T stage, \nurban/rural and year of diagnosis from the 30-day mortality model \nat an alpha level of removal of 0.1, which means all variables \nin the final model have a p-value < 0.1. After controlling for the \nselected variables in the model, open surgery patients had a \n41% higher odds to die within 30-days after surgery comparing \nto minimally invasive surgery patients (OR = 1.41; 95%CI = \n(1.18 - 1.69); p < 0.001). In Table 6, year of diagnosis was dropped \nfrom the final model to predict overall survival. Patients that \nunderwent open surgery had 12% more chance to die before \nthose that underwent minimally invasive surgery (HR = 1.12; \n95% CI = (1.06-1.18); p < 0.001).\nStratified Multivariable model\nWhen fitting the data into a main-effect model, as in Table 5 or \nTable 6, an imposed assumption is that the effect of treatment \non outcomes is the same across all subgroups defined by the \ncontrolled variables. This assumption may or may not hold, and \nexploring and identifying subgroups that may benefit more from \ntreatment can lead us to a deeper insight. Instead of splitting \nthe dataset into smaller, separated data sets, fitting an interac\ufffetion model on the entire data set is more appropriate22. As shown \nin Table 7, we fit a multivariable model including an interaction \nterm between surgical approaches and histology, still implement\ufffeing the backward elimination procedure. In the related %PHREG_\nSEL code, the first three terms in VAR were protected from \nelimination by setting INC = 3, to keep the interaction of interest \n(surg_app*his_cat) in the model. The macro parameters EFFECT\nand SLICEBY allow users to specify the variables for the \ntreatment effect and subgroups (the two variables have to be \ncategorical variables for the macro to run correctly). Setting \nSHORTREPORT = T, only reports the hazard ratio (HR) and \nthe p-value of surgical approach by histology subgroup, and if \nset to F, the HR for all other control variables in the model will \nbe reported. This macro can only handle one interaction at a time \nbut is useful as an initial exploration for the treatment effect in \nsubgroups.\nIn Table 7, detailed information about variable selection in the \nmodel building process is shown in the footnote. We see that, \noverall, minimally invasive surgery shows a protective effect on \nsurvival compared to open surgery, but such protection is more \npronounced among adenocarcinoma patients (HR = 0.85; \np < 0.001) than squamous cell carcinomas (HR = 0.96; p = 0.321). \nThe p-value for interaction term is 0.069, and it tests the differ\ufffeence among the HR of 0.85, 0.95, and 0.96 for the three histol\ufffeogy groups. If using the significance level of 0.05, the interaction \np-value may confirm that the hazard ratio for the surgical \napproaches is the same across the histology groups. In the case \nof a significant interaction effect, researchers should report the \ninteraction model and discuss the treatment effect in each \nsubgroup.\n******** SAS\u00ae code example for %PHREG_SEL and \n%LOGREG_SEL **************;\nTITLE \u2018Table 5 Multivariable Logistic Regression Model for \n30-day Mortality\u2019;\n%LOGREG_SEL(\nDSN = anal,\nOUTCOME = PUF_30_DAY_MORT_CD,\nEVENT = 'Yes',\nPage 11 of 21\nF1000Research 2019, 7:1955 Last updated: 14 NOV 2024\n\nTable 5.

The KM \nplot for overall survival (specified in EVENTS, CENSORS) \nstratified by surgical approaches (specified in GRPLIST) was \ncarried out with the key information of interest reported in a sum\ufffemary table. This macro has many options that allow the user to \ncontrol the appearance of the plot (TITLE, XTICK, XMAX, \nNONCENSORED, and ATRISK) and output the estimated \naccrual survival rate at pre-specified time points (TIMELIST). \nThis macro becomes handier when there are multiple datasets, \nseveral outcomes, or multiple variables of interest. Users can \nproduce multiple KM plots in one macro call for all combina\ufffetions of the parameter values by listing multiple values separated \nby spaces in DSN, EVENTS/CENSORS, and GRPLIST.\nIn Figure 2, the two survival curves by surgical approaches do \nnot reach the survival probability of 0.5, and hence the median \nsurvival time is not estimable (will show as NAs).

Overall, the \nlog-rank p < 0.001 indicates a significantly improved overall \nsurvival in the minimally invasive surgery group over the open \nsurgery group (note that the KM method is only univariate anal\ufffeysis). However, a gain of 4.3% improvement in 5-year survival \nrate may or may not be clinically significant, and a large sample \nsize may easily lead to small p-values. In such cases, researchers \nmay shed light on both the clinical relevance and statistical \nsignificance to interpret results. \n************ SAS\u00ae code example for %KM_PLOT *********;\n%KM_PLOT(DSN = anal,\nEVENTS = os_surg,\nCENSORS = os_censor,\nGRPLIST = surg_app,\nTITLE = \"Figure 2 KM plot of Overall Survival by Surgical \nApproach\u201d, \nUNIT = Month, JOIN = T, PLOT = T, TABLE = T,\nTIMELIST = 12 60, NONCENSORED = T,\nXTICK = (0 12 24 36 48 60), XMAX = 60, ATRISK = T,\nOUTPATH = &dir,\nFNAME = Figure 2 KM plot of Overall Survival by Surgical \nApproaches);\n****************************************************;\nDiscussion\nA natural course of research is generally iterative and con\ufffeducted by a research team with mixed expertise and experience \nlevels.

They help process a massive \namount of variables effortlessly, produce complete and inter\ufffepretable summary information to support the research team to \ncomprehend and better plan for the next step, and provide \na highly-organized and concise coding interface that facilitates \neasy updates as research evolves.\nResearch based on observational or retrospective data needs \nextra effort in the study design and data management before \ndata analysis, and careful interpretation afterward. The pre\ufffesented case study also illustrated a simple analytic workflow \nshowing how to build an analytic project from the foundation, \ncomprehend different layers of information jointly from the \nroutine data analyses, and envision where you are and where \nto go. This work can serve as a nice tutorial for researchers to \neasily get their research off the ground.\nThe limitations include the requirements for researchers to \nbe comfortable with the SAS\u00ae environment and have basic sta\ufffetistical training in data handling and interpretation. The proposed \nSAS\u00ae macros don\u2019t handle study design or data management. \nA properly defined study population, cohort, outcomes, covari\ufffeates, and sufficient literature review are critical before using \nour macros for the sake of research quality. Since only relevant \ninformation is summarized and reported, the macros don\u2019t \ncover issues such as assumption check or goodness of fit about \nthe fitted model at this time point. Including an experienced \nbiostatistician in the research team would be beneficial.\nThese macros were first created in 201119, and have been \nimplemented in many projects to help turn out high-quality\nresearch, efficiently. They are still under active upgrade to meet \nnew needs (e.g., %UNI_PHREG is in its 26th version). At this \ntime point, we are still lack of some desired features such as to \nallow users to decide the variable order in the final report, or to \nimplement an automatic decision about the appropriateness \nof a parametric test or non-parametric test in %UNI_CAT or\n%UNI_NUM, or to set the customized report template. However, \nthose tasks along others are listed in our next round of upgrade \nand will become available soon.

Although this\nPage 17 of 21\nF1000Research 2019, 7:1955 Last updated: 14 NOV 2024\n\nwork is fundamental, it\u2019ll benefit statisticians a lot by avoiding time-consuming and tedious copy\ufffeand-paste processes. The idea of \u201cstreamlined routine data analyses\u201d has been in my mind for\nyears, and I do deem that all the available SAS macros in the SAS community are segmented for\nthe whole data analyses process, thus, what we need is not more segmented SAS macros, but a\nset of SAS macros that can work seamlessly as an entire system. That\u2019s why I developed the\n\u2018%ggTable\u2019 series of SAS macros and published \u2018%ggBaseline\u2019, the first macro of the ggTable series\n(Gu\u00a0et al., 20181). Although other SAS macros of this series are still under preparation for a peer\ufffereviewed publication, I\u2019m glad to be a reviewer of this work and share some of my considerations\nthat might help move this publication forward.\nMajor considerations:\nThe title of this paper might be a little broad or exaggerated. Besides binary and time to\nevent outcomes discussed in this article, multinomial and continuous variables can also be\noutcomes in observational studies. In addition, many statistical methods, such as\npropensity score-based methods, say stratifying, matching, and inverse probability\nweighting, are more and more popular nowadays in observational studies. Last, it\u2019s\ncommon to use generalized estimating equation (GEE) models or mixed models to account\nfor clustered data, since many centers are enrolled in observational studies.\u00a0\n1. \nMinor considerations:\nFor %DESCRIPTIVE, %UNI_CAT and % UNI_NUM, the variables list is specified by CLIST and\nNLIST separately; this way has some drawbacks, such as 1) The order in the table will be\ngrouped by variable type and always be categorical variables first; 2) Statistical tests and\nvariable labels cannot be specified when calling the macros. However, this would not be a\nproblem in %ggBaseline.\n1. \nIt would be better to report the mean with standard deviation (SD) in the same line as mean\n\u00b1 SD, the median with interquartile range (IQR) as median (IQR).\n2. \nK-M plot with No. at risk is highly recommended, and the border of the legend should be\nremoved as well.\n3. \nIt would be great if the authors can improve these SAS macros with the consideration of the above\nconcerns. If there is no improvement, more discussions on these limitations and comparison to\nother available macros are needed in the discussion section.\nReferences\n1.

In the revision, we added them\ninto the Box 1 with a few more explanation in the context. Even the case study did not use\nthem, they are all available in our final downloadable package, and the usage is similar as in\nother macros in the case study.\nFor the propensity score-based methods, we also created a series of macros for propensity\nscore estimation, matching/weighting/stratification, balance check, visualization, etc. but\nsince this paper was mainly focus on the routine data analyses, we decided to leave the PS\nrelated components and to develop a separate paper in the future.\nWe do appreciate that Dr. Gu pointed out some limitations and have included those\nlimitations in the discussion section.

            "response": "The article introduces a series of SAS macros called \"Carrying out streamlined routine data analyses with reports for observational studies: introduction to a series of generic SAS macros\" aimed at facilitating research processes in observational studies. These macros cover routine data analyses, including descriptive analyses, univariate associations, multivariable analyses, and subgroup analyses, as well as reporting and communication aspects. The proposed macros fit into the research framework by addressing the importance of routine data analyses, which helps researchers understand the landscape of the entire study population, identify confounding effects, and assess missing data, outliers, or possible data entry errors. The article explains the operation and implementation of these macros, providing examples of their usage in a real-life research project based on the NCDB. The authors suggest adding more features, such as a user-friendly interface, to enhance end-user experience. Overall, the article highlights the significance of routine data analyses in observational studies and proposes a solution to facilitate the research process. The article received positive feedback from two independent reviewers regarding the technical soundness, clarity of presentation, and relevance of the topic.

Such assessments are crucial to identify, understand, and address differences in care delivery across patient\npopulations, particularly those that could affect access to or quality of care.\nObjective: The aim of this study was to examine changes in ambulatory visit volume and type (ie, in-person vs virtual and\ntelephone vs video visits) by patient sociodemographics during the COVID-19 pandemic at one urban academic medical center.\nMethods: We compared volumes and patient sociodemographics (age, sex, race, insurance) for visits during the first 11 weeks\nfollowing the COVID-19 national emergency declaration (March 15 to May 31, 2020) to visits in the corresponding weeks in\n2019. Additionally, for visits during the COVID-19 study period, we examined differences in visit type (ie, in-person versus\nvirtual, and telephone versus video visits) by sociodemographics using multivariate logistic regression.\nResults: Total visit volumes in the COVID-19 study period comprised 51.4% of the corresponding weeks in 2019 (n=80,081\nvs n=155,884 visits). Although patient sociodemographics between the COVID-19 study period in 2020 and the corresponding\nweeks in 2019 were similar, 60.5% (n=48,475) of the visits were virtual, compared to 0% in 2019. Of the virtual visits, 61.2%\n(n=29,661) were video based, and 38.8% (n=18,814) were telephone based. In the COVID-19 study period, virtual (vs in-person)\nvisits were more likely among patients with race categorized as other (vs White) and patients with Medicare (vs commercial)\ninsurance and less likely for men, patients aged 0-17 years, 65-74 years, or \u226575 years (compared to patients aged 18-45 years),\nand patients with Medicaid insurance or insurance categorized as other. Among virtual visits, compared to telephone visits, video\nvisits were more likely to be adopted by patients aged 0-17 years (vs 18-45 years), but less likely for all other age groups, men,\nBlack (vs White) patients, and patients with Medicare or Medicaid (vs commercial) insurance.\nConclusions: Virtual visits comprised the majority of ambulatory visits during the COVID-19 study period, of which a majority\nwere by video. Sociodemographic differences existed in the use of virtual versus in-person and video versus telephone visits. To\nensure equitable care delivery, we present five policy recommendations to inform the further development of virtual visit programs\nand their reimbursement.\nhttps://medinform.jmir.org/2020/12/e24544 JMIR Med Inform 2020 | vol. 8 | iss. 12 | e24544 | p. 1\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nJMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS Gilson et al\nXSL\u2022FO\nRenderX\n\n(JMIR Med Inform 2020;8(12):e24544) doi: 10.2196/24544\nKEYWORDS\ntelemedicine; telehealth; video visit; telephone visit; virtual visit; COVID-19; age; sex; race; insurance; demographic; retrospective\nIntroduction\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly altered the landscape\nof health care delivery. One of the major changes resulting from\nthe pandemic has been the rapid adoption of virtual (ie,\ntelephone and video) visits and other telemedicine programs\nthat facilitate health care services via health care information\ntechnologies to accommodate necessary reductions in in-person\ncare [1,2]. A major driver for this adoption was the Centers for\nMedicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) expansion of virtual visit\nreimbursement on March 17, 2020, under the 1135 waiver\nauthority. This allowed for Medicare reimbursement of multiple\nvisit types performed virtually, including outpatient clinic visits,\nretroactively starting March 6, 2020, and continuing for the\nduration of the public health emergency [3]. This shift to\nreimburse virtual visits helped clinicians continue caring for\npatients despite widespread shelter-in-place orders and may\nrepresent the beginning of a new era for ambulatory medicine.\nUnfortunately, access to virtual visits may not be equitable in\nthe United States. Differential access to the internet and devices\nand differences in health literacy may leave patients without\nthe ability to attend video visits. Thus, those patients may only\nbe able to participate in telephone visits if they are unable to\nattend in-person visits. Surveys by the Pew Research Center in\n2019 found lower rates of internet usage and smartphone\nownership among people ages \u226565 years compared to younger\nadults [4,5]. When examining access to internet and internet\ntechnology by race, Black adults had lower rates of access to\nthe internet and lower rates of desktop or laptop computer\nownership than White adults [4,6]. A recent study of Medicare\nbeneficiaries found that digital access was lowest among patients\nwho were \u226585 years, Black, or received Medicaid [7].\nAdditionally, adults who are older, men, and Black have been\nshown to have lower health literacy levels than those who are\nyounger, women, and White; and low health literacy is\nassociated with a greater likelihood of needing help performing\nonline tasks [8-10]. These disparities in access to the internet\nand devices and lower health literacy levels may lead to\ncorresponding disparities in health care delivery and quality,\nparticularly if the quality of health care visits and visit\nsatisfaction are greater with video visits compared to telephone\nvisits [11-13]. Furthermore, patients who opted out of virtual\nvisits entirely and continued to attend in-person visits during\nthe pandemic may have increased their risk of exposure to\nCOVID-19 or experienced decreased appointment availability\ndue to the decrease in in-person capacity required to maintain\nCOVID-19 social distancing. Thus, though virtual visits have\nbeen considered an integral part of delivery of health care during\nthe pandemic, access to those visits (especially video visits)\nmay have been affected by underlying differences in access to\ntechnology and health literacy.\nThere is already existing evidence that other recent innovations\nin health care technology may exacerbate differences in health\ncare access. For example, patient portal use, which has the\npotential to improve the quality and efficiency of health care\ndelivery, differs with respect to race, insurance, and\nneighborhood broadband internet access [14]. One study found\nthat patient portal use was lower among Black (vs White)\npatients; Medicare, Medicaid, and uninsured (vs commercially\ninsured) patients; and patients with decreased neighborhood\nbroadband internet access [14]. Other studies using data prior\nto the COVID-19 pandemic have additionally suggested that\ntelemedicine and patient-facing health information technology\nutilization is lower among men, patients over 65 years,\nnon-White patients, patients without commercial insurance, and\npatients living in neighborhoods with low internet access; this\nlack of internet access and technology proficiency continues to\nimpede wider adoption of health information technology among\nracial minorities and those without commercial insurance\n[15-18]. Given prior research on the benefits of telemedicine\ninterventions on clinical outcomes, such as improvement in\nglycemic control in medically underserved patients with\ndiabetes, these disparities in the use of and access to digital\nhealth may directly translate into disparities in health care\nquality [19].\nDespite widespread interest in the use of virtual visits for\nambulatory patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic, few\nstudies to date have evaluated the adoption of ambulatory virtual\nvisits during the pandemic by age, race, sex, or insurance [20].\nThe studies that have been published recently show that patients\nusing virtual visits during the pandemic were more likely to be\nyounger adults as compared to older adults, female, non-White,\nand not commercially-insured [2,21-23]. This may be due in\npart to the lack of patient readiness for virtual visits, which one\nstudy found was more prevalent in patients who were older,\nmale, or Black, and affected video visits more than telephone\nvisits [24]. However, most of the studies published on data from\nthe pandemic did not evaluate the impact of these\nsociodemographic factors on the use of telephone versus video\nvirtual visits. Such assessments are crucial to identify,\nunderstand, and address differences in care delivery across\npatient populations, and inform policy decisions, particularly\nthose like reimbursement rules, which could affect access to or\nquality of care.\nIn this study, we aimed to (1) assess changes in visit volume,\ntype, and patient sociodemographics from the start of the\nCOVID-19 national emergency to the end of May 2020,\ncompared to the same weeks in 2019; and (2) elucidate\ndifferences in the use of ambulatory virtual visits (as compared\nto in-person visits) and, for those using virtual visits, the use of\nvideo visits (compared to telephone visits) by age, sex, race,\nand insurance. We hypothesize that (1) total visit volumes\ndecreased and virtual visits increased during the COVID-19\npandemic, while patient sociodemographics remained similar\nbetween the two time periods; and (2) patients who utilized\nin-person visits during the COVID-19 study period were more\nhttps://medinform.jmir.org/2020/12/e24544 JMIR Med Inform 2020 | vol. 8 | iss. 12 | e24544 | p. 2\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nJMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS Gilson et al\nXSL\u2022FO\nRenderX\n\nlikely to be younger than patients who utilized virtual visits,\nand of those using virtual visits, patients utilizing video visits\nwere more likely to be younger, White, and have commercial\ninsurance than patients utilizing telephone visits [2,21-23].\nMethods\nSetting\nThe University of Chicago Medical Center (UCMC) is the\nflagship institution of University of Chicago Medicine, and\nincludes 5 multispecialty faculty ambulatory practice sites in\nChicago, IL, and the surrounding area, with over 600,000\nencounters per year. UCMC began offering virtual visits in\nMarch 2020 in response to the widespread shelter-in-place\norders at the city, state, and regional level due to the COVID-19\npandemic. Telephone visits began during the week of March\n15, 2020. Video visits began with a pilot program in the\nhematology/oncology, pediatrics, psychiatry, gastroenterology,\nand obstetrics/gynecology practices on March 26, 2020,\nfollowed by a broad roll-out to all ambulatory faculty clinics\non April 6, 2020. All practices used a HIPAA (Health Insurance\nPortability and Accountability Act)-compliant Zoom platform\nto enable video visits, which was not integrated into the\ninstitution\u2019s electronic health record system (Epic) during the\nevaluated time period.\nImmediately after the City of Chicago and State of Illinois\nshelter-in-place orders were enacted, patients with previously\nscheduled in-person office visits were contacted and given the\noption to either reschedule or convert their appointment to a\nvirtual visit. If a patient agreed to a virtual visit, a video visit\nwas encouraged. Patients scheduled for video visits were sent\nthe following through the patient portal or email: a Zoom link\nfor the video visit; a brief prevideo visit checklist followed by\nmore detailed instructions describing the technical requirements\nto participate in the video visit; and a link to a video highlighting\nmethods to best prepare for the video visit and a demonstration\nof what to expect. If the patient was unable or unwilling to\nparticipate in a video visit, a telephone visit was scheduled, and\nthey were told to expect a call from their provider at the\nscheduled appointment time. Patients reaching out to schedule\nnew virtual visits were also preferentially offered video visits\nbut were given the opportunity to schedule a telephone visit as\nwell in accordance with their preferences. The availability of\nvirtual visits was marketed widely to our patient population\nthrough our patient portal, marketing emails, and our health\nsystem\u2019s internet home page. Beginning on May 1, 2020,\npatients were given the option to begin self-scheduling video\nvisits (but not telephone visits) through the patient portal.\nStudy Population and Measures\nAll adult and pediatric outpatient clinic visits occurring in\nUCMC faculty practice locations from March 15 to May 31,\n2019, and March 15 to May 31, 2020, were included. The type\nof outpatient clinic visit was classified as in-person or virtual,\nand virtual visits were further classified as telephone or video,\nbased on the scheduled visit type for all completed visits. Patient\nsociodemographic data were examined for each visit, including\nage, sex, race, and insurance. Age was categorized into 5 groups:\n0-17 years, 18-45 years, 46-64 years, 65-74 years, and \u226575\nyears. Patients were grouped into 3 racial categories: White,\nBlack, and other (which included Asian/Mideast Indian,\nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/other\nPacific Islander, more than one race, patient declined, and\nunknown). Insurance was categorized as Medicare (including\nMedicare-Medicaid Alignment Initiative), Medicaid,\ncommercial, or other. The data were extracted from the\ninstitution\u2019s electronic health record data warehouse. This\nproject received a formal determination of Quality Improvement\naccording to institutional policy. As such, this initiative was not\nreviewed by the Institutional Review Board.\nStatistical Analysis\nFirst, we used descriptive statistics to examine weekly and\noverall visit volumes during the study period, which were the\n11 weeks following the COVID-19 national emergency\ndeclaration (March 15 to May 31, 2020), compared to visit\nvolumes in the corresponding weeks of the 2019 calendar year.\nNext, we examined visit type (in-person, video, telephone) and\npatient sociodemographics (age, sex, race, insurance) associated\nwith the visit and compared these characteristics to those visits\noccurring during the same date range in 2019. Last, we\nexamined differences in ambulatory visit type (in-person vs\nvirtual; and for those with virtual visits, video vs telephone) by\npatient sociodemographics (age, sex, race, insurance) for visits\noccurring during the COVID-19 study period.\nData were summarized with chi-square tests where appropriate.\nBecause of the large sample size, statistical significance was\nset at P\u2264.001. To estimate the association between patient\nsociodemographics and visit type (in-person vs virtual, and\nvideo vs phone for those with virtual visits), we performed\nlogistic regression. Results were similar between unadjusted\nand adjusted analyses; only adjusted analyses are presented.\nData were analyzed using RStudio, version 3.6.3 (RStudio,\nPBC).\nResults\nVisit Volumes and Visit Types\nIn the week of March 15-21, 2020, the ambulatory visit volume\ndropped to 34% of visit volumes when compared to the same\nweek in 2019 (n=4877 vs n=14,343 visits) and reached a nadir\nof 20.8% of 2019 levels (n=2476 vs n=11,930 visits) in the\nfollowing week. By the week of May 24-30, 2020, the\nambulatory visit volume had rebounded to 81.8% of the volume\nof the same week in 2019 (n=9451 vs n=11,554 visits). Total\nvisit volumes from March 15 to May 31, 2020, were 51.4% of\n2019 volumes (n=80,081 vs n=155,884 visits).\nVirtual ambulatory visits increased from 0 to 48,475 visits\nbetween March 15 to May 31, 2020, and comprised 60.5% of\ntotal ambulatory visit volume, with the remaining 39.5%\n(n=31,606) conducted in person (Table 1 and Figure 1). Among\nvirtual visits performed during the study period, 61.2%\n(n=29,661) were by video and 38.8% (n=18,814) were by\ntelephone. For comparison, in 2019, there were no virtual visits\nfor the same time period. Patient sociodemographics were\nsimilar for those with ambulatory visits between March 15 to\nMay 31, 2020, and the corresponding weeks in 2019 (Table 1).\nhttps://medinform.jmir.org/2020/12/e24544 JMIR Med Inform 2020 | vol. 8 | iss. 12 | e24544 | p. 3\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nJMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS Gilson et al\nXSL\u2022FO\nRenderX\n\nTable 1.

In adjusted\nanalyses, virtual visits were less likely than in-person visits for\npatients aged 0-17 years (odds ratio [OR] 0.71, 95% CI\n0.68-0.75), 65-74 years (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.76-0.84), and \u226575\nyears (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.80-0.91), compared to patients aged\n18-45 years (Table 1). Men were less likely (OR 0.88, 95% CI\n0.85-0.90) to attend a virtual visit than women. There was no\ndifference in the odds of virtual visit attendance between White\nand Black patients; however, patients with race categorized as\nother were more likely to attend a virtual visit (OR 1.22, 95%\nCI 1.16-1.28) compared to White patients. Medicare patients\nwere more likely (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.21-1.34) than patients\nwith commercial insurance to attend virtual visits (vs in-person\nvisits), whereas patients with Medicaid insurance were less\nlikely (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.70-0.77) than patients with\ncommercial insurance to have virtual visits. Patients with\ninsurance categorized as other were also less likely to have a\nvirtual visit (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.19-0.24) than patients with\ncommercial insurance.\nAssociation Between Virtual Visit Type (Telephone vs\nVideo) and Patient Sociodemographics for Those With\nVirtual Visits\nIn unadjusted analyses, there were statistically significant\ndifferences across all sociodemographics examined except sex\nbetween those using telephone versus video visits (Table 2).

Recovery of clinic volumes\nafter the escalation of the pandemic was largely driven by virtual\nambulatory care, which comprised over 60% (n=48,475) of total\nambulatory clinic volumes from March 15 through May 31,\n2020, a majority of which were video visits. Children, adults\n\u226565 years, men, and patients with Medicaid coverage were less\nlikely to have virtual visits, whereas patients with Medicare\ncoverage were more likely to have virtual visits compared to\npatients with commercial insurance coverage. For those who\nattended virtual visits, children were more likely to have video\nvisits, while adults \u226546 years, men, Black patients, and patients\nwith Medicare or Medicaid coverage were less likely to have\nvideo visits.\nThe sociodemographic differences in virtual visits we identified\nare in line with prior research. For example, prior research found\nthat women were more likely than men to shelter in place due\nto concerns about the risk of COVID-19 infection for themselves\nand their family; this would make virtual visits a more appealing\nvisit type for women [25]. Additionally, studies prior to the\npandemic demonstrated that women used virtual visits more\noften than men [11]. Similarly, patients with Medicare insurance\nmay have been more concerned about acquiring COVID-19\ninfection and prefer to shelter in place, leading to their increased\nlikelihood of attending a virtual visit. In contrast, pediatric well\nvisits (and well visits for most non-Medicare beneficiaries) must\nstill be performed in person to be reimbursed; therefore, many\npediatric patients continued to attend in-person visits even\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe sociodemographic differences in virtual (vs in-person) visits\nand video (vs telephone) visits illustrate the digital divide [26].\nThe patient populations with lower levels of access to internet\nand smart devices and lower digital literacy were the same\nsociodemographic groups found in our study to have a lower\nlikelihood of completing virtual or video visits, including older\nadults, Black patients, and patients without commercial\ninsurance [4-9]. Our results also match prior studies on virtual\nvisit use during the pandemic, which found that patients using\nvirtual visits during the pandemic were more likely to be\nhttps://medinform.jmir.org/2020/12/e24544 JMIR Med Inform 2020 | vol. 8 | iss. 12 | e24544 | p. 6\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nJMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS Gilson et al\nXSL\u2022FO\nRenderX\n\nyounger adults as compared to older adults, White, and\ncommercially insured [21-23]. Requirements for a video visit\ninclude internet, a capable device, and a basic level of digital\nliteracy, so patients who do not have all three (or do not have\na readily available family member to assist) are unable to attend\nvideo visits. One study performed during the pandemic found\nhigher prevalence of \u201cunreadiness\u201d to attend video visits in\nthose sociodemographic groups found to be less likely to attend\nvideo visits, including patients who were older, Black, and men,\nsimilar to our findings [24]. These findings raise concerns about\nthe role video visits may play in exacerbating existing health\ninequities, particularly since the quality of health care visits and\nvisit satisfaction are greater with video visits compared to\ntelephone visits [11-13]. Moreover, these health disparities may\nbe significantly worsened if the current reimbursement parity\nbetween telephone and video visits is discontinued, and\nespecially if telephone visits are no longer reimbursed altogether\nfollowing the public health emergency.\nThe shift in the delivery of ambulatory care through virtual\nvisits was incentivized by the new virtual reimbursement\npolicies from CMS and private insurance companies. The\nsignificant contribution of virtual visits to overall ambulatory\nvisit volumes is likely to continue once the COVID-19 pandemic\nhas ended. The volume of virtual ambulatory visits at UCMC\nhas continued to grow even after the end of the study period,\nindicating sustained interest in virtual visits likely due to\ncontinued safety concerns related to the pandemic, ongoing\nreimbursement for these services, and physician and patient\nsatisfaction with this new option for care delivery [27,28]. Given\nthe interest in and development of virtual visits prior to the\npandemic and the proliferation of virtual visits during the\npandemic, virtual visits for ambulatory care are likely to remain\npopular among both patients and providers even after the\nCOVID-19 pandemic [1,2]. University of Chicago Medicine\u2019s\n2025 Strategic Vision (developed prior to the pandemic)\nincludes an \u201caim to build a digitally enabled organization for\npatients\u201d and a goal to expand access to care, both of which are\naided by the expansion of virtual visit services [29]. However,\nif reimbursement for virtual visits is discontinued or significantly\nreduced after the pandemic or public health emergency ends,\nmany medical centers are likely to stop making significant\ninvestments in the continued development of their telemedicine\nprograms and the availability of virtual visits for patients would\nbe expected to decline.\nRecommendations\nThe results of this study and our review of the virtual visit\nlandscape has prompted us to offer five recommendations\n(Textbox 1). First, given the differences in virtual visit use by\ncertain sociodemographic groups demonstrated in this study\nand the lower effective reimbursement rates for telephone visits\ncompared to video visits, medical institutions like UCMC with\nhigh proportions of older, Black, and/or Medicare/Medicaid\npatients may experience lower reimbursement rates because of\nthe barriers these groups face to completing video visits. For a\nvideo visit, providers can bill for all time spent on patient care\non the encounter date, including documentation; for a telephone\nvisit, they can only bill for time spent in direct communication\n(on the telephone call) with a patient on the encounter date. To\navoid effectively penalizing medical institutions providing care\nto vulnerable populations, government and commercial insurers\nshould help address these disparities by maintaining\nreimbursement parity between video and telephone visits.\nSecond, given the rapid growth and early success of virtual\nvisits, and the role they will likely play in blended models of\ncare, legislation that makes virtual visit reimbursement\npermanent is essential to allow for the long-term investment by\nhealth care systems and providers needed to improve the virtual\nvisit infrastructure and experience. Third, government insurers\nand specialty societies should collaborate to establish guidance\nto help distinguish ambulatory care best suited for virtual versus\nin-person care. Fourth, quality improvement initiatives should\nbe undertaken at medical institutions to support and improve\naccess to and usability of video visits in populations\nencountering the greatest barriers to its use. Last, advocacy for\npolicy changes and more universal broadband access are\nessential to help close the digital divide experienced by our\nmost vulnerable patient populations, which would help address\nthe differential access to virtual visits described in this study.\nTextbox 1. Recommendations to improve access to and use of virtual visits.\n1. Maintain reimbursement parity between video and telephone visits\n2. Pass legislation making virtual visit reimbursement permanent\n3. Establish guidance to distinguish ambulatory care best suited for virtual versus in-person care\n4. Perform quality improvement initiatives to improve access to and usability of video visits in vulnerable populations\n5. Advocate for policy changes and universal broadband access to close the digital divide\nLimitations\nOur study has limitations. First, this study only examined a\nsingle medical center and was a retrospective analysis; despite\nthis, the diversity of the patient population examined in our\nstudy enabled our analysis of ambulatory virtual visit use.\nSecond, our study only examined a limited set of variables,\nwhich were used as surrogates for the social determinants of\nhealth described in this paper, such as access to broadband\ninternet, health literacy, tech literacy, education, and income,\nand did not examine virtual and video visit use by ethnicity due\nto limited data availability. Third, this area of clinical practice\nand study is rapidly changing and will likely continue to change\nrapidly over the next few months to years. Further studies at\nother medical institutions should be conducted to confirm our\nfindings and examine additional sociodemographic variables.\nFuture analyses of ambulatory virtual visits should also\ninvestigate patient satisfaction and outcomes by patient visit\nhttps://medinform.jmir.org/2020/12/e24544 JMIR Med Inform 2020 | vol. 8 | iss. 12 | e24544 | p. 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nJMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS Gilson et al\nXSL\u2022FO\nRenderX\n\ntype (eg, new, return, consult), given the differences in\nreimbursement by visit type category, and whether ambulatory\nvirtual visits increase the geographic area served by academic\nmedical centers or medical institutions with subspecialty care,\nas already suggested by limited data [30].\nConclusion\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed the health\ncare delivery landscape largely due to the growth of ambulatory\nvirtual visits, which have rapidly become a vital component of\nhealth care delivery. Given the differential use of these\ntechnologies by age, sex, race, and insurance, these changes\nalso risk perpetuating and even exacerbating existing disparities\nin health care access and quality, especially if reimbursement\npolicies do not sufficiently account for these differences and\nthe digital divide remains unaddressed.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank Megan Huisingh-Scheetz, Michael Cui, and Omar Jamil for their input regarding this study;\nWhitney Westphal and Mary Kate Springman for their assistance in obtaining and cleaning data for this study; and Mengqi Zhu\nfor her review of analytic methods.\nConflicts of Interest\nNone declared.\nReferences\n1.

The study focused on virtual visits, which were introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and how they differed from in-person visits regarding patient characteristics. The results showed that total visit volumes decreased during the pandemic, but virtual visits increased dramatically, accounting for approximately 60% of all outpatient visits in May 2020. Patients utilizing virtual visits were more likely to be younger, White, and have commercial insurance than those using in-person visits. Video visits were preferred over telephone visits, especially among younger patients. These findings suggest that virtual visits can serve as a viable alternative to traditional in-person visits, particularly for certain patient populations, and should be taken into account when developing future healthcare policies related to reimbursement rules.",

The purpose of this article is to clearly describe the differences in indications between\nscoping reviews and systematic reviews and to provide guidance for when a scoping review is (and is not)\nappropriate.\nResults: Researchers may conduct scoping reviews instead of systematic reviews where the purpose of the\nreview is to identify knowledge gaps, scope a body of literature, clarify concepts or to investigate research\nconduct. While useful in their own right, scoping reviews may also be helpful precursors to systematic reviews\nand can be used to confirm the relevance of inclusion criteria and potential questions.\nConclusions: Scoping reviews are a useful tool in the ever increasing arsenal of evidence synthesis approaches.\nAlthough conducted for different purposes compared to systematic reviews, scoping reviews still require rigorous\nand transparent methods in their conduct to ensure that the results are trustworthy. Our hope is that with clear\nguidance available regarding whether to conduct a scoping review or a systematic review, there will be less scoping\nreviews being performed for inappropriate indications better served by a systematic review, and vice-versa.\nKeywords: Systematic review, Scoping review, Evidence-based healthcare\nBackground\nSystematic reviews in healthcare began to appear in pub\ufffelication in the 1970s and 1980s [1, 2]. With the emer\ufffegence of groups such as Cochrane and the Joanna Briggs\nInstitute (JBI) in the 1990s [3], reviews have exploded in\npopularity both in terms of the number conducted [1],\nand their uptake to inform policy and practice. Today,\nsystematic reviews are conducted for a wide range of\npurposes across diverse fields of inquiry, different evi\ufffedence types and for different questions [4]. More re\ufffecently, the field of evidence synthesis has seen the\nemergence of scoping reviews, which are similar to sys\ufffetematic reviews in that they follow a structured process,\nhowever they are performed for different reasons and\nhave some key methodological differences [5\u20138]. Scop\ufffeing reviews are now seen as a valid approach in those\ncircumstances where systematic reviews are unable to\nmeet the necessary objectives or requirements of know\ufffeledge users. There now exists clear guidance regarding\nthe definition of scoping reviews, how to conduct scop\ufffeing reviews and the steps involved in the scoping review\nprocess [6, 8]. However, the guidance regarding the key\nindications or reasons why reviewers may choose to fol\ufffelow a scoping review approach is not as straightforward,\nwith scoping reviews often conducted for purposes that\ndo not align with the original indications as proposed by\nArksey and O\u2019Malley [5\u201310]. As editors and peer re\ufffeviewers for various journals we have noticed that there\nis inconsistency and confusion regarding the indications * Correspondence: Zachary.Munn@adelaide.edu.au\nThe Joanna Briggs Institute, The University of Adelaide, 55 King William Road,\nNorth Adelaide 5005, South Australia\n\u00a9 The Author(s). 2018 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and\nreproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to\nthe Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

The purpose of this art\ufffeicle is to provide practical guidance for reviewers on\nwhen to perform a systematic review or a scoping re\ufffeview, supported with some key examples.\nIndications for systematic reviews\nSystematic reviews can be broadly defined as a type of\nresearch synthesis that are conducted by review groups\nwith specialized skills, who set out to identify and re\ufffetrieve international evidence that is relevant to a particu\ufffelar question or questions and to appraise and synthesize\nthe results of this search to inform practice, policy and\nin some cases, further research [11\u201313]. According to\nthe Cochrane handbook, a systematic review \u2018uses expli\ufffecit, systematic methods that are selected with a view to\nminimizing bias, thus providing more reliable findings\nfrom which conclusions can be drawn and decisions\nmade.\u2019 [14] Systematic reviews follow a structured and\npre-defined process that requires rigorous methods to\nensure that the results are both reliable and meaningful\nto end users. These reviews may be considered the pillar\nof evidence-based healthcare [15] and are widely used to\ninform the development of trustworthy clinical guide\ufffelines [11, 16, 17].\nA systematic review may be undertaken to confirm or\nrefute whether or not current practice is based on rele\ufffevant evidence, to establish the quality of that evidence,\nand to address any uncertainty or variation in practice\nthat may be occurring. Such variations in practice may\nbe due to conflicting evidence and undertaking a sys\ufffetematic review should (hopefully) resolve such conflicts.\nConducting a systematic review may also identify gaps,\ndeficiencies, and trends in the current evidence and can\nhelp underpin and inform future research in the area.\nSystematic reviews can be used to produce statements to\nguide clinical decision-making, the delivery of care, as\nwell as policy development [12]. Broadly, indications for\nsystematic reviews are as follows [4]:\n1. Uncover the international evidence\n2. Confirm current practice/ address any variation/\nidentify new practices\n3. Identify and inform areas for future research\n4. Identify and investigate conflicting results\n5. Produce statements to guide decision-making\nDespite the utility of systematic reviews to address the\nabove indications, there are cases where systematic reviews\nare unable to meet the necessary objectives or require\ufffements of knowledge users or where a methodologically ro\ufffebust and structured preliminary searching and scoping\nactivity may be useful to inform the conduct of the\nsystematic reviews. As such, scoping reviews (which are\nalso sometimes called scoping exercises/scoping studies)\n[8] have emerged as a valid approach with rather different\nindications to those for systematic reviews. It is important\nto note here that other approaches to evidence synthesis\nhave also emerged, including realist reviews, mixed\nmethods reviews, concept analyses and others [4, 18\u201320].\nThis article focuses specifically on the choice between a\nsystematic review or scoping review approach.\nIndications for scoping reviews\nTrue to their name, scoping reviews are an ideal tool to\ndetermine the scope or coverage of a body of literature\non a given topic and give clear indication of the volume\nof literature and studies available as well as an overview\n(broad or detailed) of its focus. Scoping reviews are use\ufffeful for examining emerging evidence when it is still un\ufffeclear what other, more specific questions can be posed\nand valuably addressed by a more precise systematic re\ufffeview [21]. They can report on the types of evidence that\naddress and inform practice in the field and the way the\nresearch has been conducted.\nThe general purpose for conducting scoping reviews is\nto identify and map the available evidence [5, 22]. Arskey\nand O\u2019Malley, authors of the seminal paper describing a\nframework for scoping reviews, provided four specific\nreasons why a scoping review may be conducted [5\u20137,\n22]. Soon after, Levac, Colquhoun and O\u2019Brien further\nclarified and extended this original framework [7]. These\nauthors acknowledged that at the time, there was no\nuniversally recognized definition of scoping reviews nor\na commonly acknowledged purpose or indication for\nconducting them. In 2015, a methodological working\ngroup of the JBI produced formal guidance for conduct\ufffeing scoping reviews [6]. However, we have not previously\naddressed and expanded upon the indications for scop\ufffeing reviews. Below, we build upon previously described\nindications and suggest the following purposes for con\ufffeducting a scoping review:\n\u0001 To identify the types of available evidence in a given\nfield\n\u0001 To clarify key concepts/ definitions in the literature\n\u0001 To examine how research is conducted on a certain\ntopic or field\n\u0001 To identify key characteristics or factors related to a\nconcept\n\u0001 As a precursor to a systematic review\n\u0001 To identify and analyse knowledge gaps\nDeciding between a systematic review and a\nscoping review approach\nAuthors deciding between the systematic review or\nscoping review approach should carefully consider the\nMunn et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology (2018) 18:143 Page 2 of 7\n\nindications discussed above for each synthesis type and\ndetermine exactly what question they are asking and\nwhat purpose they are trying to achieve with their re\ufffeview. We propose that the most important consideration\nis whether or not the authors wish to use the results of\ntheir review to answer a clinically meaningful question\nor provide evidence to inform practice. If the authors\nhave a question addressing the feasibility, appropriate\ufffeness, meaningfulness or effectiveness of a certain treat\ufffement or practice, then a systematic review is likely the\nmost valid approach [11, 23]. However, authors do not\nalways wish to ask such single or precise questions, and\nmay be more interested in the identification of certain\ncharacteristics/concepts in papers or studies, and in the\nmapping, reporting or discussion of these characteris\ufffetics/concepts. In these cases, a scoping review is the bet\ufffeter choice.\nAs scoping reviews do not aim to produce a critically\nappraised and synthesised result/answer to a particular\nquestion, and rather aim to provide an overview or map\nof the evidence. Due to this, an assessment of methodo\ufffelogical limitations or risk of bias of the evidence in\ufffecluded within a scoping review is generally not\nperformed (unless there is a specific requirement due to\nthe nature of the scoping review aim) [6]. Given this as\ufffesessment of bias is not conducted, the implications for\npractice (from a clinical or policy making point of view)\nthat arise from a scoping review are quite different com\ufffepared to those of a systematic review. In some cases,\nthere may be no need or impetus to make implications\nfor practice and if there is a need to do so, these implica\ufffetions may be significantly limited in terms of providing\nconcrete guidance from a clinical or policy making point\nof view. Conversely, when we compare this to systematic\nreviews, the provision of implications for practice is a\nkey feature of systematic reviews and is recommended\nin reporting guidelines for systematic reviews [13].\nExemplars for different scoping review indications\nIn the following section, we elaborate on each of the in\ufffedications listed for scoping reviews and provide a num\ufffeber of examples for authors considering a scoping\nreview approach.\nTo identify the types of available evidence in a given field\nScoping reviews that seek to identify the types of evi\ufffedence in a given field share similarities with evidence\nmapping activities as explained by Bragge and colleagues\nin a paper on conducting scoping research in broad\ntopic areas [24]. Chambers and colleagues [25] con\ufffeducted a scoping review in order to identify current\nknowledge translation resources (and any evaluations of\nthem) that use, adapt and present findings from system\ufffeatic reviews to suit the needs of policy makers. Following\na comprehensive search across a range of databases,\norganizational websites and conference abstract reposi\ufffetories based upon predetermined inclusion criteria, the\nauthors identified 20 knowledge translation resources\nwhich they classified into three different types (over\ufffeviews, summaries and policy briefs) as well as seven\npublished and unpublished evaluations. The authors\nconcluded that evidence synthesists produce a range of\nresources to assist policy makers to transfer and utilize\nthe findings of systematic reviews and that focussed\nsummaries are the most common. Similarly, a scoping\nreview was conducted by Challen and colleagues [26] in\norder to determine the types of available evidence identi\ufffefying the source and quality of publications and grey lit\ufffeerature for emergency planning. A comprehensive set of\ndatabases and websites were investigated and 1603 rele\ufffevant sources of evidence were identified mainly address\ufffeing emergency planning and response with fewer\nsources concerned with hazard analysis, mitigation and\ncapability assessment. Based on the results of the review,\nthe authors concluded that while there is a large body of\nevidence in the field, issues with its generalizability and\nvalidity are as yet largely unknown and that the exact\ntype and form of evidence that would be valuable to\nknowledge users in the field is not yet understood.\nTo clarify key concepts/definitions in the literature\nScoping reviews are often performed to examine and\nclarify definitions that are used in the literature. A scop\ufffeing review by Schaink and colleagues27 was performed\nto investigate how the notion of \u201cpatient complexity\u201d\nhad been defined, classified, and understood in the exist\ufffeing literature. A systematic search of healthcare data\ufffebases was conducted. Articles were assessed to\ndetermine whether they met the inclusion criteria and\nthe findings of included articles were grouped into five\nhealth dimensions. An overview of how complexity has\nbeen described was presented, including the varying def\ufffeinitions and interpretations of the term. The results of\nthe scoping review enabled the authors to then develop\na complexity framework or model to assist in defining\nand understanding patient complexity [27].\nHines et al. [28] provide a further example where a\nscoping review has been conducted to define a concept, in\nthis case the condition bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The\nauthors revealed significant variation in how the condition\nwas defined across the literature, prompting the authors\nto call for a \u2018comprehensive and evidence-based defin\ufffeition\u2019. [28]\nTo examine how research is conducted on a certain topic\nScoping reviews can be useful tools to investigate the de\ufffesign and conduct of research on a particular topic. A\nscoping review by Callary and colleagues29 investigated\nMunn et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology (2018) 18:143 Page 3 of 7\n\nthe methodological design of studies assessing wear of a\ncertain type of hip replacement (highly crosslinked poly\ufffeethylene acetabular components) [29]. The aim of the\nscoping review was to survey the literature to determine\nhow data pertinent to the measurement of hip replace\ufffement wear had been reported in primary studies and\nwhether the methods were similar enough to allow for\ncomparison across studies. The scoping review revealed\nthat the methods to assess wear (radiostereometric ana\ufffelysis) varied significantly with many different approaches\nbeing employed amongst the investigators. The results\nof the scoping review led to the authors recommending\nenhanced standardization in measurements and methods\nfor future research in this field [29].\nThere are other examples of scoping reviews investi\ufffegating research methodology, with perhaps the most\npertinent examples being two recent scoping reviews of\nscoping review methods [9, 10]. Both of these scoping\nreviews investigated how scoping reviews had been re\ufffeported and conducted, with both advocating for a need\nfor clear guidance to improve standardization of\nmethods [9, 10]. Similarly, a scoping review investigating\nmethodology was conducted by Tricco and colleagues30\non rapid review methods that have been evaluated, com\ufffepared, used or described in the literature. A variety of\nrapid review approaches were identified with many in\ufffestances of poor reporting identified. The authors called\nfor prospective studies to compare results presented by\nrapid reviews versus systematic reviews.\nTo identify key characteristics or factors related to a\nconcept\nScoping reviews can be conducted to identify and exam\ufffeine characteristics or factors related to a particular\nconcept. Harfield and colleagues (2015) conducted a\nscoping review to identify the characteristics of indigen\ufffeous primary healthcare service delivery models [30\u201332].\nA systematic search was conducted, followed by screen\ufffeing and study selection. Once relevant studies had been\nidentified, a process of data extraction commenced to\nextract characteristics referred to in the included papers.\nOver 1000 findings were eventually grouped into eight\nkey factors (accessible health services, community par\ufffeticipation, culturally appropriate and skilled workforce,\nculture, continuous quality improvement, flexible ap\ufffeproaches to care, holistic health care, self-determination\nand empowerment). The results of this scoping review\nhave been able to inform a best practice model for indi\ufffegenous primary healthcare services.\nAs a precursor to a systematic review\nScoping reviews conducted as precursors to systematic\nreviews may enable authors to identify the nature of a\nbroad field of evidence so that ensuing reviews can be\nassured of locating adequate numbers of relevant studies\nfor inclusion. They also enable the relevant outcomes\nand target group or population for example for a par\ufffeticular intervention to be identified. This can have par\ufffeticular practical benefits for review teams undertaking\nreviews on less familiar topics and can assist the team to\navoid undertaking an \u201cempty\u201d review [33]. Scoping re\ufffeviews of this kind may help reviewers to develop and\nconfirm their a priori inclusion criteria and ensure that\nthe questions to be posed by their subsequent systematic\nreview are able to be answered by available, relevant evi\ufffedence. In this way, systematic reviews are able to be\nunderpinned by a preliminary and evidence-based scop\ufffeing stage.\nA scoping review commissioned by the United King\ufffedom Department for International Development was\nundertaken to determine the scope and nature of litera\ufffeture on people\u2019s experiences of microfinance. The results\nof this scoping review were used to inform the develop\ufffement of targeted systematic review questions that fo\ufffecussed upon areas of particular interest [34].\nIn their recent scoping review on the conduct and\nreporting of scoping reviews, Tricco and colleagues10 re\ufffeveal only 12% of scoping reviews contained recommen\ufffedations for the development of ensuing systematic\nreviews, suggesting that the majority of scoping review\nauthors do not conduct scoping reviews as a precursor\nto future systematic reviews.\nTo identify and analyze gaps in the knowledge base\nScoping reviews are rarely solely conducted to simply\nidentify and analyze gaps present in a given knowledge\nbase, as examination and presentation of what hasn\u2019t\nbeen investigated or reported generally requires exhaust\ufffeive examination of all of what is available. In any case,\nbecause scoping reviews tend to be a useful approach for\nreviewing evidence rapidly in emerging fields or topics,\nidentification and analysis of knowledge gaps is a com\ufffemon and valuable indication for conducting a scoping\nreview. A scoping review was recently conducted to re\ufffeview current research and identify knowledge gaps on\nthe topic of \u201coccupational balance\u201d, or the balance of\nwork, rest, sleep, and play [35]. Following a systematic\nsearch across a range of relevant databases, included\nstudies were selected and in line with predetermined in\ufffeclusion criteria, were described and mapped to provide\nboth an overall picture of the current state of the evi\ufffedence in the field and to identify and highlight know\ufffeledge gaps in the area. The results of the scoping review\nallowed the authors to illustrate several research \u2018gaps\u2019,\nincluding the absence of studies conducted outside of\nwestern societies, the lack of knowledge around peoples\u2019\nlevels of occupational balance, as well as a dearth of evi\ufffedence regarding how occupational balance may be\nMunn et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology (2018) 18:143 Page 4 of 7\n\nenhanced. As with other scoping reviews focussed upon\nidentifying and analyzing knowledge gaps, results such\nas these allow for the identification of future research\ninitiatives.\nDiscussion\nScoping reviews are now seen as a valid review approach\nfor certain indications. A key difference between scoping\nreviews and systematic reviews is that in terms of a review\nquestion, a scoping review will have a broader \u201cscope\u201d\nthan traditional systematic reviews with correspondingly\nmore expansive inclusion criteria. In addition, scoping re\ufffeviews differ from systematic reviews in their overriding\npurpose. We have previously recommended the use of the\nPCC mnemonic (Population, Concept and Context) to\nguide question development [36]. The importance of\nclearly defining the key questions and objectives of a scop\ufffeing review has been discussed previously by one of the au\ufffethors, as a lack of clarity can result in difficulties\nencountered later on in the review process [36].\nConsidering their differences from systematic reviews,\nscoping reviews should still not be confused with trad\ufffeitional literature reviews. Traditional literature reviews\nhave been used as a means to summarise various publi\ufffecations or research on a particular topic for many years.\nIn these traditional reviews, authors examine research\nreports in addition to conceptual or theoretical literature\nthat focuses on the history, importance, and collective\nthinking around a topic, issue or concept. These types of\nreviews can be considered subjective, due to their sub\ufffestantial reliance on the author\u2019s pre-exiting knowledge\nand experience and as they do not normally present an\nunbiased, exhaustive and systematic summary of a topic\n[12]. Regardless of some of these limitations, traditional\nliterature reviews may still have some use in terms of\nproviding an overview of a topic or issue. Scoping re\ufffeviews provide a useful alternative to literature reviews\nwhen clarification around a concept or theory is re\ufffequired. If traditional literature reviews are contrasted\nwith scoping reviews, the latter [6]:\n\u0001 Are informed by an a priori protocol\n\u0001 Are systematic and often include exhaustive\nsearching for information\n\u0001 Aim to be transparent and reproducible\n\u0001 Include steps to reduce error and increase reliability\n(such as the inclusion of multiple reviewers)\n\u0001 Ensure data is extracted and presented in a\nstructured way\nAnother approach to evidence synthesis that has\nemerged recently is the production of evidence maps\n[37]. The purpose of these evidence maps is similar to\nscoping reviews to identify and analyse gaps in the\nknowledge base [37, 38]. In fact, most evidence mapping\narticles cite seminal scoping review guidance for their\nmethods [38]. The two approaches therefore have many\nsimilarities, with perhaps the most prominent difference\nbeing the production of a visual database or schematic\n(i.e. map) which assists the user in interpreting where\nevidence exists and where there are gaps [38]. As\nMiake-Lye states, at this stage \u2018it is difficult to determine\nwhere one method ends and the other begins.\u2019 [38] Both\napproaches may be valid when the indication is for de\ufffetermining the extent of evidence on a particular topic,\nparticularly when highlighting gaps in the research.\nA further popular method to define and scope con\ufffecepts, particularly in nursing, is through the conduct of\na concept analysis [39\u201342]. Formal concept analysis is \u2018a\nprocess whereby concepts are logically and systematic\ufffeally investigated to form clear and rigorously constructed\nconceptual definitions,\u2019 [42] which is similar to scoping\nreviews where the indication is to clarify concepts in the\nliterature. There is limited methodological guidance on\nhow to conduct a concept analysis and recently they\nhave been critiqued for having no impact on practice\n[39]. In our opinion, scoping reviews (where the purpose\nis to systematically investigate a concept in the litera\ufffeture) offer a methodologically rigorous alternative to\nconcept analysis with their results perhaps being more\nuseful to inform practice.\nComparing and contrasting the characteristics of trad\ufffeitional literature reviews, scoping reviews and systematic\nreviews may help clarify the true essence of these differ\ufffeent types of reviews (see Table 1).\nRapid reviews are another emerging type of evidence\nsynthesis and a substantial amount of literature have ad\ufffedressed these types of reviews [43\u201347]. There are various\ndefinitions for rapid reviews, and for simplification pur\ufffeposes, we define these review types as \u2018systematic re\ufffeviews with shortcuts.\u2019 In this paper, we have not\ndiscussed the choice between a rapid or systematic re\ufffeview approach as we are of the opinion that perhaps the\nmajor consideration for conducting a rapid review (as\ncompared to a systematic or scoping review) is not the\npurpose/question itself, but the feasibility of conducting\na full review given financial/resource limitations and\ntime pressures. As such, a rapid review could potentially\nbe conducted for any of the indications listed above for\nthe scoping or systematic review, whilst shortening or\nskipping entirely some steps in the standard systematic\nor scoping review process.\nThere is some overlap across the six listed purposes\nfor conducting a scoping review described in this paper.\nFor example, it is logical to presume that if a review\ngroup were aiming to identify the types of available evi\ufffedence in a field they would also be interested in identify\ufffeing and analysing gaps in the knowledge base. Other\nMunn et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology (2018) 18:143 Page 5 of 7\n\ncombinations of purposes for scoping reviews would also\nmake sense for certain questions/aims. However, we\nhave chosen to list them as discrete reasons in this paper\nin an effort to provide some much needed clarity on the\nappropriate purposes for conducting scoping reviews. As\nsuch, scoping review authors should not interpret our\nlist of indications as a discrete list where only one pur\ufffepose can be identified.\nIt is important to mention some potential abuses of\nscoping reviews. Reviewers may conduct a scoping re\ufffeview as an alternative to a systematic review in order to\navoid the critical appraisal stage of the review and ex\ufffepedite the process, thinking that a scoping review may\nbe easier than a systematic review to conduct. Other re\ufffeviewers may conduct a scoping review in order to \u2018map\u2019\nthe literature when there is no obvious need for \u2018map\ufffeping\u2019 in this particular subject area. Others may conduct\na scoping review with very broad questions as an alter\ufffenative to investing the time and effort required to craft\nthe necessary specific questions required for undertaking\na systematic review. In these cases, scoping reviews are\nnot appropriate and authors should refer to our guid\ufffeance regarding whether they should be conducting a sys\ufffetematic review instead.\nThis article provides some clarification on when to\nconduct a scoping review as compared to a systematic\nreview and clear guidance on the purposes for conduct\ufffeing a scoping review. We hope that this paper will pro\ufffevide a useful addition to this evolving methodology and\nencourage others to review, modify and build upon these\nindications as the approach matures. Further work in\nscoping review methods is required, with perhaps the\nmost important advancement being the recent develop\ufffement of an extension to the Preferred Reporting Items\nfor Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)\nfor scoping reviews [48] and the development of soft\ufffeware and training programs to support these reviews\n[49, 50]. As the methodology advances, guidance for\nscoping reviews (such as that included in the Joanna\nBriggs Institute Reviewer\u2019s Manual) will require revision,\nrefining and updating.\nConclusion\nScoping reviews are a useful tool in the ever increasing ar\ufffesenal of evidence synthesis approaches. Researchers may\npreference the conduct of a scoping review over a system\ufffeatic review where the purpose of the review is to identify\nknowledge gaps, scope a body of literature, clarify con\ufffecepts, investigate research conduct, or to inform a system\ufffeatic review. Although conducted for different purposes\ncompared to systematic reviews, scoping reviews still re\ufffequire rigorous and transparent methods in their conduct\nto ensure that the results are trustworthy. Our hope is that\nwith clear guidance available regarding whether to conduct\na scoping review or a systematic review, there will be less\nscoping reviews being performed for inappropriate indica\ufffetions better served by a systematic review, and vice-versa.\nAcknowledgements\nNone.\nFunding\nNo funding was provided for this paper.\nAvailability of data and materials\nNot applicable.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions\nZM: Led the development of this paper and conceptualised the idea for a\npaper on indications for scoping reviews.

            "response": "This critical review aims to distinguish between two types of evidence synthesis approaches - systematic reviews and scoping reviews - and provide guidance on when to choose one over the other. Systematic reviews are recommended when the goal is to answer a specific clinical question or provide evidence to inform practice, while scoping reviews are suitable when the aim is to identify the types of evidence available in a specific field, clarify key concepts or definitions, examine how research is conducted on a certain topic, or identify key characteristics or factors related to a concept. Both approaches involve a structured and predefined process, but scoping reviews do not typically assess the methodological limitations or risk of bias of included evidence. Examples of each type of review are provided to illustrate their respective uses. Ultimately, the decision to select either a systematic review or a scoping review depends on the research question and intended outcome.",
