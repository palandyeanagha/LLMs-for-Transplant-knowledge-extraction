Likewise, the detrimental effect of early-onset hyperuri\ufffecemia on the graft function was dependent on UA-level and\nexposure time. After control of the baseline graft function by\nanalysis of only recipients with a good graft function at 1 year post\ufffetransplantation (eGFR . 60 ml/min), moderate-to-severe early\ufffeonset hyperuricemia was also a marker of long-term graft\ndysfunction and failure [24]. Haririan et al found that higher\nUA level had significant higher risk of graft loss compared to lower\nUA level. Each 1 mg/dL increase of UA level was associated with\na 15% increase on average in the risk of graft loss during the study\nperiod and seemed to be associated with increased risk of death\n[26]. These two studies suggested that both higher UA-level and\nlonger duration of exposure have severe impacts on graft function.\nAdvantages and Limitations\nThis meta-analysis has some advantages. First, the samples of\nincluded cohort studies came from Korea, China, Canada,\nPoland, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, USA and German that would\nhave a good representative of race. Second, the effect of\nHyperuricemia on renal function is consistent regardless of\nwhether other confounding factors were adjusted or not. Third,\nthe included studies have moderate to high quality and good\ninternal validity.\nLimitations of this study should be noted. First, the included\nstudies had potential risk of bias due to differences in complete\nreporting of follow-up and judgment of outcomes. Second,\nalthough included study adjusted confounding factors relevant to\nrenal function more or less, the number and types of adjusted\nfactors were different. There are maybe residual confounding\nfactors which have effects on outcomes. However, the pooled\nestimates found that no matter confounding factors adjusted or un\ufffeadjusted, no matter how many confounding factors were adjusted,\nthe conclusion that hyperuricemia is a risk factor of graft\ndysfunction and poor prognosis is consistent.

        "text": "4.10. Limitations of this review\nFirstly, the number of RCTs that investigated treatment strategies in\nthe donor and their impact on graft function and survival after trans\ufffeplantation is limited. Furthermore, as our search strategy focused on\ndonor treatment only, potentially promising treatment strategies of\nthe graft after procurement and during preservation were excluded\nthat may be of a pre-transplant treatment potential. In addition, several\nstudies we did include were performed with a low number of partici\ufffepants, did not report power calculations or were underpowered to de\ufffetect changes in the outcome parameters as stipulated in this review.\nConsequentially, potential effects on organ function or survival might\nhave been missed and interpretation of the data from these studies\nshould be done with caution. Furthermore, we acknowledge that\nsome outcome parameters, such as plasma bilirubin to assess liver func\ufffetion or number of organs transplanted in the case of the kidney, are pos\ufffesibly weakly correlated to organ injury. However, as these endpoints\nwere assessed in conjunction with other biomarkers, the prognostic\nvalue of these endpoints is strengthened. The few number of studies\nalso limited us from assessing the risk of publication bias or perform\nsubgroup analyses. Therefore, drawing conclusions from these studies\nis risky, particularly when grouping for meta-analyses was not possible.\nAdditionally, we found limited studies on lung transplantation, and no\nstudies on pancreas or intestinal transplantations. Lastly, we realise\nthat several promising treatment strategies published in relevant ani\ufffemal models are not included in this article. However, we believe that\nthese studies were outside the scope of this review as interpretation\nof these results are not yet influential in clinical decision making in de\ufffeceased donor care.\n5. Conclusions\nThe current global shortage of suitable donor organs and often un\ufffecertainty which organ to accept or decline, underlines the need for op\ufffetimisation of deceased donor care. Treatment strategies aim at\nreducing the detrimental effects of haemodynamic, hormonal, inflam\ufffematory, and metabolic disturbances prior to organ retrieval. Better con\ufffeditioning of the grafts-to-be and reducing, or even preventing, donor\uffferelated injury prior to preservation and transplantation have become\nimportant goals to transplant higher risk donor organs, without\ncompromising outcomes after transplantation. Unfortunately, current\ndonor management protocols may vary considerably per centre and\nare based on low-level evidence. In this systematic review, we could\nnot find consistent evidence supporting that any individual treatment\nthat has been tested until now will protect donor organs or improve sur\ufffevival after transplantation. More organised and defined RCTs are re\ufffequired to identify and validate possible benefits of innovative\ntreatments before clinical implementation can be recommended as\npart of standard donor care. We feel that a concerted action between\nprofessionals in Intensive Care and organ transplantation is needed to\ngain better insight and stimulate clinically relevant interventions in\nDBD donors.\nAuthors' contributions\nAE and LD both performed the initial search, selection and assess\ufffement of the articles, and wrote the manuscript.

However, 1-year graft survival was\ncomparable in both groups (49).\nFurthermore, in another RCT, kidneys were either preserved\nby HMP or SCS. In accordance with Moers as well as\nJochmans, the primary end-point was the occurrence of DGF.\nSecondary endpoints were primary non-function as well as graft\nsurvival. Both the risk of DGF and the incidence of non\ufffefunction were significantly reduced by HMP in their cohort.\nOne-year graft survival and function could be improved by\ndynamic cold graft preservation (52). Despite these findings,\nthe importance of different factors such as the impact of CIT\nand the combination of CIT with HMP have to be mentioned.\nCIT is a known independent risk factor for DGF. In order\nto investigate which kidney graft may further benefit from\nHMP prior to transplantation, Kox et al. analyzed prospectively\ncollected data from the \u201cMachine Perfusion Trial.\u201d A total of 752\nrenal transplants were included with 376 dynamically preserved\nkidneys and 376 statically preserved grafts. They identified CIT\nas an independent risk factor for DGF. Furthermore, HMP did\nnot prevent DGF if CIT exceeded 10 h (51).\nThe optimal timepoint for, as well as the optimal duration of,\nHMP is still a matter of debate. HMP can be used either as a\nprimary preservation method or in the end-ischemic phase as\na reconditioning tool. Matos et al. were able to show a faster\nrecovery of renal function if grafts were subjected to HMP prior\nto transplantation after a mean SCS period of 22 h. MP time was\nat least 6 h. However, this beneficial effect was limited to donors\nunder the age of 50, who represent a rather selective group (94).\nFurther studies followed, indicating a beneficial effect of MP in\nthe end-ischemic phase by displaying a reduction of DGF, as\nwell as an improved organ acceptance. This last positive trend is\nattributed mainly to the possibility of organ monitoring (95, 96).\nNMP of the Kidney\nNMP of the kidney may eventually resolve many issues\nrelated to damage induced by ischemic phases. The idea of\npreserving kidney grafts under almost physiological conditions\nwith the possibility of real-life assessment of the graft prior to\ntransplantation sounds intriguing. However, while the number\nof preclinical studies using animal models as well as discarded\nhuman kidneys is steadily increasing, evidence for NMP of\nthe kidney in a clinical setting is rather poor. Hosgood et al.\nwere first to transform preclinical experience into clinical reality\nby transplanting a 62-year-old ECD kidney into a 55-year old\nrecipient. After 11 h of SCS, the graft was perfused with a\nplasma-free red cell-based solution at 33.9\u25e6C for 35 min prior\nto transplantation. Although a slow graft function was observed,\nthe patient remained dialysis free with a serum creatinine level\nof 132 \u00b5mol/L at 3 months post-transplantation. In contrast, the\nrecipient of the opposite kidney developed DGF (64). Based on\nthis first success, the Leicester group translated NMP into clinical\nreality on a larger scale.

        "text": "[29,30]. Spitzer et al. [30] concluded that steatosis should\nbe added to the DRI, when dealing with a high-risk\ndonor. However, objective evaluation of the range of\nsteatosis, either as macro- or microvesicular steatosis, is\nnot standardized so far subjective to some degree [29].\nWe believe that routine donor biopsy evaluation may en\ufffeable the design of more powerful and robust donor risk\nscores.\nWe believe that the prognostic power of the DRI and\nET-DRI is further significantly undermined by the fact\nthat graft acceptance decisions on offered organs for\ntransplantation are not documented and evaluated in\nthese scores. There is an urgent need to evaluate and ad\ufffedress this shortcoming immediately, especially on the\nbackground of the current liver transplant scandals in\nGermany [23,31]. We believe that this aspect is a rele\ufffevant issue in liver transplantation today. Transplant cen\ufffeters regard their graft acceptance policy as their\npotential advantage in a highly competitive area for a\nvery scarce resource in times of ubiquitous organ short\ufffeage. It can be assumed that these aspects of potentially\nunwanted transparency by the proponents of transplant\ufffeation stood in the way of previous attempts to generate\nrobust prognostic scores that include donor organ qual\ufffeity. This may represent a deeper reason for the notorious\ndifficulty to assess donor organ quality and its impact on\nprognosis after transplantation objectively.\nThe balance of equity and utility in donor organ allo\ufffecation is a serious ethical dilemma. Several risk predic\ufffetion models are available and their head to head\ncomparisons would benefit from standardized reporting\nand formal, consistent statistical evaluation [18,26]. It\nwas claimed previously and in a different context that\noutcome selection and optimism biases may affect litera\ufffeture on prognostic scores in medicine [26].\nWe would like to propose joint efforts to develop a ro\ufffebust and objective donor risk score in an international\ncollaboration that should include the available large\ndata-sets from multiple institutions. We believe that the\ntime has come for a consensus on the reporting of the\nreasons for declined organ offers and on quality stan\ufffedards for prognostic scores and their statistical analysis\nand validation. Jacob et al. [18] proposed a reasonable\nscientific approach to the latter. High quality scientific\njournals should make uniform requirements mandatory\nfor the reporting of prognostic scores.\nConclusion\nThe results of this current study clearly show that the\nET-DRI is not applicable in the population from our\ncenter within the Eurotransplant community for the pre\ufffediction of patient or graft survival. On the background\nof a paucity of proper prognostic models, justified organ\nallocation which weighs urgency against prediction of\nsuccess of liver transplantation must be the aim of future\nresearch in this field.\nPatients and methods\nEthics statement\nAs an observational retrospective study, according to the\nProfessional Code of the German Medical Association\n(article B.III. \u00a7 15.1), neither informed consent nor ap\ufffeproval of the ethics committee was needed for this\nstudy.\nPatients\n291 consecutive liver transplants were included to\nanalyze the model\u2019s accuracy and applicability for this\ndataset of a major transplant centre in the Eurotrans\ufffeplant community.

        "text": "Description of included studies\nThe 37 studies comprised both prospective and retrospective\ncase series, and collectively included a total of 53,691 patients.\nIn most, the main objective was not to assess the relationship\nbetween MELD and post-transplant survival. Instead, studies\nexamined a broad range of pre-transplant factors that may or\nmay not influence survival through exploratory analyses.\nStudies originated from several countries, including: Belgium\n(2), New Zealand (1), the United Kingdom (3), Brazil (6), Spain\n(5), the United States (7), Singapore (1), Turkey (1), China (1),\nKorea (1), Switzerland (1), Poland (1), Italy (3), Canada (1),\nand Germany (3). The majority were single centered. Sample\nsizes ranged from 46 to 21,673 patients (mean = 1451, median\n= 222), most of whom were male. None used a power\ncalculation to determine sample size. Sampling methods\ncomprised consecutive patients who met inclusion/exclusion\ncriteria, which differed considerably across studies. Therefore,\npatients comprising the \u201cgeneral transplant population\u201d may\nhave varied. The point at which MELD was measured in\npatients was inconsistent across studies, with some using time\nof placement on the transplant list and others using time of\ntransplant. In most of the studies, the relationship between\nMELD and survival was examined through stratified analyses\nof survival across sub-groups defined by MELD score, where\nMELD cut-off points for sub-groups were determined post-hoc.\nFurther, the majority(25) measured the association between\nMELD and survival based on univariate analyses alone, and,\ntherefore, did not control for potential confounders. Eleven of\nthe studies assessed the predictive ability of the MELD score\non post-transplantation survival using a receiver operating\ncharacteristic (ROC) curve and the c-statistic. In 4 of the\nstudies, there was partial overlap of patient populations since\nthey included data from the Transplant Scientific Registry\n(Cywinski et al [4], Freeman et al [5], Rana et al [6] and Yoo &\nThuluvath [7]). All of these studies were kept in the review as\neach used different MELD categories and follow-up times in\ntheir analysis. A detailed summary of each study is presented\nin Table C in File S1.\nAs mentioned above, the majority of studies grouped\npatients by MELD. Specifically, MELD, which represents a\ncontinuous variable, was converted to a categorical variable for\nthe analyses. The cut-off points for such categories varied\nwidely across studies and were typically determined post-hoc.\n(Refer to relevant outcome measures in Table C in File S1).\nEffect measures also differed, ranging from proportions to\nhazards ratios, odds ratios, and relative risks, and follow-up\ntime periods were inconsistent. Lastly, characteristics of the\n\u201cgeneral transplant population\u201d varied. Therefore, given such\nclinical heterogeneity across studies, a meta-analysis was\ndeemed inappropriate, and a statistical assessment of\nheterogeneity was not performed.\nQuality of included studies\nBased on the Oxford Center for Evidence-based Medicine\nLevels of Evidence, the quality of all of the included studies\nwas level IV.

The actual half-life for a transplanted\nkidney from a deceased donor (the most\ncommon source of kidneys for transplan\ufffetation) is only 8 years (2), and as few as\none-third of kidney allografts obtained\nfrom older donors remain function\ufffeing 10 years later (3). Allograft dysfunc\ufffetion can result in the need for a further\ntransplant and is a strong independent\npredictor of recipient cardiovascular\nmortality (4). Late graft loss is commonly\ncaused by chronic allograft nephropa\ufffethy, characterized by tissue fibrosis and\ntubular atrophy (5). Among the factors\nknown to contribute to its pathogenesis\nare uncontrolled alloimmune reactivity\n(T cell\u2013 and/or antibody-mediated injury),\nrecurrent primary renal disease, hyper\ufffetension, diabetes, and drug toxicity. With\nregard to the latter, kidney toxicity as a\nresult of long-term treatment with the\nimmunosuppressive agents tacrolimus or\ncyclosporine is detectable in virtually all\ntransplanted kidneys (6).\nAlthough research progress hasimproved\nour knowledge of the prevalence, clinical\nsignificance, and pathogenesis of chron\ufffeic kidney allograft injury, research has\nnot yet influenced therapeutic decision\nmaking to improve outcomes. Currently,\nposttransplant care, including immuno\ufffesuppression, is protocol driven. Altera\ufffetions in drug dosing are made based on\ncenter-derived protocols and physician\nexperience. Because chronic injury is mul\ufffetifactorial, a one-size-fits-all approach\nis not ideal. To develop individual thera\ufffepeutic approaches tailored to individual\npatients, transplant physicians need risk\nassessment tools that can discriminate\nspecific pathogenic mechanisms, prospec\ufffetively identify those transplant recipients\ndestined to have excellent graft function,\nrecognize those recipients at high risk for\ngraft loss, and ultimately guide specific\nchanges in therapy.

        "text": "transplant MELD scores with post-transplant survival, were all\ncase series and predominantly retrospective in design. All\nstudies recruited consecutive patients over a specified time\nperiod, thereby reducing the risk of selection bias.\nAssociation between Pre-Transplant MELD Score and\nPost-Transplantation Survival\nOf the 37 studies, 15 found no association between pre\ufffetransplant MELD score and post-transplant patient survival,\nwhile 22 reported poorer survival with higher MELD. A detailed\ndescription of the results of each study is presented in Table C\nin File S1. Based on qualitative analyses, there were no clear\ndifferences in studies with statistically significant findings\ncompared to those with no statistically significant findings. In\nboth groups, sample sizes varied, as did follow-up times.\nHowever, findings from the two largest studies (N >15,000)\nboth suggested that survival decreased with increasing MELD.\nOne observed this relationship only when patients with MELD\nscores under 9 were compared to those with scores of 30 or\ngreater, while the other had treated MELD as a continuous\nvariable. At the same time, of the 7 other studies that analysed\nMELD as a continuous variable, all but one found no\nstatistically significant association between MELD and survival.\nIn most of the studies, information presented on patient\ncharacteristics was limited. Therefore, it was not possible to\nidentify any differences in patient populations that could explain\ninconsistencies in the findings.\nPredictive ability of MELD score for post\ufffetransplantation survival\nEleven studies presented a receiver operating characteristic\n(ROC) curve to determine the predictive ability of pre-transplant\nMELD score to determine post-transplantation survival. The\narea under the curve is used to produce a concordance value\ncalled the c-statistic. A c-statistic of 0.50 indicates no predictive\nability, and is expected if the results are due to chance alone.\nIn contrast, a c-statistic of 1 represents perfect discrimination.\nValues under 0.7 suggest poor predictive power, while those\ngreater than 0.70 indicate a useful test, and those higher than\n0.80 imply excellent predictive accuracy[2]. Among the 11\nstudies, 10 reported c-statistics less than <0.7, indicating that\nMELD poorly predicted post-transplant survival. This included\nthe largest study contributing to the review[6]. In 1 study, the c\ufffestatistic decreased over time, from 0.711 for 3-month post\ufffetransplant survival to 0.679 for 12-month survival[8]. In the\nsingle study with a high c-statistic[9], there was no clear\ndifference in sample size, follow-up time, or patient population\nwhen compared to the studies with lower values.\nDiscussion\nThis review assessed the association and predictive ability of\npre-transplantation MELD score on post-transplantation\nsurvival in adults with end-stage liver disease. It highlighted\ndiscrepancies in findings across studies. Such discrepancies\nmay be related to the nature of the studies, The vast majority\nwere retrospective case series that relied upon exploratory\nstratified analyses of data to detect a relationship between\nMELD and post-transplant survival. As such, analytical\ntechniques, rather than study design, were used to control for\nconfounding. In addition, most of the studies were single\ncentered, with each site having its own process for prioritizing\npatients for transplant. Therefore, patients constituting the\ngeneral transplant population may have varied across studies.\nThus, while using pre-transplant MELD to predict post\ufffetransplant survival in transplant candidates may be attractive,\nthere is little evidence to support it. Prospective studies\ndesigned specifically to examine this relationship are needed.\nMELD score does appear to have a greater impact on mortality\nwhen observed in combination with other known risk factors for\npost-transplant mortality, including sub-optimal livers, low graft\ufffeto-body ratio and presence of Hepatitis C.

The \nputative scenario of events based on our findings is described in Section \u201cDiscussion.\u201d Briefly, step 1: subendothelial migration of monocytes, step 2: migration of \npro-inflammatory CD16+ monocytes toward the tissue, and step 3: macrophage polarization in to high numbers of anti-inflammatory M2-macropghages \ncontributing to remodeling and fibrosis of the damaged heart.\n10\nvan den Bosch et al. Monocytes in Heart Transplant Rejection\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org March 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 346\nout macrophage or NK\u00a0cell phenotype as the cell source. M2 \nmacrophages accumulate increasingly in tissue during rejec\ufffetion suggesting that the presence of CD16+ monocytes, with \na presumed pro-inflammatory nature, and anti-inflammatory \nIL-10-producing M2 macrophages are parts of a micro-envi\uffferonmental balance within the endomyocardial tissue. Higher \ntissue macrophage frequencies are known to predict worse graft \noutcome (20). Future research is needed to investigate mono\ufffecyte\u2013macrophage profiles during acute antibody-mediated \nrejection.\nIn Figure\u00a0 6, we attempt to visualize a model based on our \ndata. It is tempting to think that preferentially CD16+ mono\ufffecytes will leave circulation and enter the graft at transplantation, \ncausing vasculopathy in due time (21). Rejection results in an \neven higher influx of activated CD16+ monocytes producing \npro-inflammatory cytokines. At the same time, a counterbal\ufffeanced predominance of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages \ncontributes to the remodeling and fibrosis of the damaged heart \ntissue (22).\nIn conclusion, although the numbers of included patients \nin this explorative study are limited, fibrosis is investigated \nby Serius Red stainings and not by cardiac MRI with delayed \ngadolinium pre- and post-rejection, to our knowledge, this is \nthe first report on matched serial blood samples and EMBs at \ntime points prior to rejection and at rejection. Here, we showed \nthat CD16+ monocytes and M2 macrophages hallmark the \ncorrelates of acute cellular rejection on tissue level and seem \nto be associated with fibrosis after heart transplant rejection in \nthe long term. The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms \nunderlying these cellular shifts may lead to discovery of new \nmolecular biomarkers indicating the immunological graft \nstatus and may help finding new molecular targets for specific \nimmunotherapy.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nTB contributed in the process of writing, experimenting, design, \ndiscussing, and data analyses.
