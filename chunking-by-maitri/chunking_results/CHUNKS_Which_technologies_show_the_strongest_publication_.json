Only 10\nyears ago, the total number of publications on AI in\nradiology only just exceeded 100 per year. Thereafter, we\nhad a tremendous increase, with over 700\u2013800\npublications per year in 2016\u201317.

Radiologists again at\nthe forefront of innovation in medicine\nFilippo Pesapane1\u2020\n, Marina Codari2*\u2020 and Francesco Sardanelli2,3\nAbstract\nOne of the most promising areas of health innovation is the application of artificial intelligence (AI), primarily in medical\nimaging. This article provides basic definitions of terms such as \u201cmachine/deep learning\u201d and analyses the integration\nof AI into radiology. Publications on AI have drastically increased from about 100\u2013150 per year in 2007\u20132008\nto 700\u2013800 per year in 2016\u20132017. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography collectively account for\nmore than 50% of current articles. Neuroradiology appears in about one-third of the papers, followed by musculoskeletal,\ncardiovascular, breast, urogenital, lung/thorax, and abdomen, each representing 6\u20139% of articles. With an irreversible\nincrease in the amount of data and the possibility to use AI to identify findings either detectable or not by the human\neye, radiology is now moving from a subjective perceptual skill to a more objective science. Radiologists, who were on\nthe forefront of the digital era in medicine, can guide the introduction of AI into healthcare. Yet, they will not be replaced\nbecause radiology includes communication of diagnosis, consideration of patient\u2019s values and preferences, medical\njudgment, quality assurance, education, policy-making, and interventional procedures. The higher efficiency provided\nby AI will allow radiologists to perform more value-added tasks, becoming more visible to patients and playing a vital\nrole in multidisciplinary clinical teams.\nKeywords: Neural networks (computer), Artificial intelligence, Deep learning, Machine learning, Radiology\nKey points\n\u0001 Over 10 years, publications on AI in radiology have\nincreased from 100\u2013150 per year to 700\u2013800 per\nyear\n\u0001 Magnetic resonance imaging and computed\ntomography are the most involved techniques\n\u0001 Neuroradiology appears as the most involved\nsubspecialty (accounting for about one-third of the\npapers), followed by musculoskeletal, cardiovascular,\nbreast, urogenital, lung/thorax, and abdominal\nradiology (each representing 6\u20139% of articles)\n\u0001 Radiologists, the physicians who were on the\nforefront of the digital era in medicine, can now\nguide the introduction of AI in healthcare\nIntroduction\nOne of the most promising areas of health innovation is\nthe application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical im\ufffeaging, including, but not limited to, image processing and\ninterpretation [1].

Due to this wide range of applications, AI\nis expected to massively impact the radiologist\u2019s daily life.\nThis article provides basic definitions of terms com\ufffemonly used when discussing AI applications, analyses\nvarious aspects related to the integration of AI in the\nradiological workflow, and provides an overview of the\nbalance between AI threats and opportunities for radiol\ufffeogists.

Similarly, adopting conservative priors \ncan substantially reduce the likelihood of claiming that \nan effect exists when in fact it does not85. At present, \nsignificance testing remains the dominant framework \nwithin neuroscience, but the flexibility of alternative (for \nexample, Bayesian) approaches means that they should \nbe taken seriously by the\u00a0field.\nConclusions and future directions\nA consequence of the remarkable growth in neurosci\ufffeence over the past 50\u00a0years has been that the effects we \nnow seek in our experiments are often smaller and more \nsubtle than before as opposed to when mostly easily dis\ufffecernible \u2018low-hanging fruit\u2019 were targeted. At the same \ntime, computational analysis of very large datasets is now \nrelatively straightforward, so that an enormous number of \ntests can be run in a short time on the same dataset. These \ndramatic advances in the flexibility of research design and \nanalysis have occurred without accompanying changes to \nother aspects of research design, particularly power. For \nexample, the average sample size has not changed sub\ufffestantially over time88 despite the fact that neuroscientists \nare likely to be pursuing smaller effects. The increase in \nresearch flexibility and the complexity of study designs89\ncombined with the stability of sample size and search for \nincreasingly subtle effects has a disquieting consequence: \na dramatic increase in the likelihood that statistically sig\ufffenificant findings are spurious. This may be at the root of \nthe recent replication failures in the preclinical literature8\nand the correspondingly poor translation of these findings \ninto humans90.\nLow power is a problem in practice because of the \nnormative publishing standards for producing novel, \nsignificant, clean results and the ubiquity of null \nhypothesis significance testing as the means of evaluat\ufffeing the truth of research findings. As we have shown, \nthese factors result in biases that are exacerbated by low \npower. Ultimately, these biases reduce the reproducibil\ufffeity of neuroscience findings and negatively affect the \nvalidity of the accumulated findings. Unfortunately, \npublishing and reporting practices are unlikely to \nchange rapidly. Nonetheless, existing scientific practices \ncan be improved with small changes or additions that \napproximate key features of the idealized model4,91,92. \nWe provide a summary of recommendations for future \nresearch practice in BOX\u00a02.\nIncreasing disclosure.

Recent researches show that top-degree ranking nodes\nhave positive effects on cooperative behaviors in social networks\n[12,13]. However, the location of a node in the network may play\na more important role than its degree. For example, a node\nlocated in the center of the network, having a few highly influential\nneighbors, may be more influential than a node having a larger\nnumber of less influential neighbors. Considering this fact, Kitsak\net al. [6] proposed a coarse-grained method by using k-core\ndecomposition to quantify a node\u2019s influence based on the\nassumption that nodes in the same shell have similar influence\nand nodes in higher-level shells are likely to infect more nodes.\nThis method may fail in some cases. For example, in a tree, all\nnodes are in 1-core and thus expected to have the same influence\naccording to [6]. However, this tree may be hierarchically\norganized (e.g., the binary tree) and nodes near the root have\nmuch higher influence than leaves. Chen et al. [14] devised a semi\ufffelocal index by considering the next nearest neighborhood, which\ncan well identify influential nodes in a hierarchical tree and give\nmore elaborate division than k-core decomposition. Experimental\nresults demonstrated that the semi-local index performs as good as\nglobal indices while has much lower computational complexity,\nand thus it obtains a good trade-off on effectiveness and efficiency.\nRecently, Chen et al. [15] considered the effect of path number\nand path diversity while ranking the spreading ability of nodes in\nnetworks and introduced two correction factors correspondingly.\nThe ranking accuracy is considerably increased compared with\nsome well-known ranking methods, such as PageRank and\nLeaderRank.\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e77455",

        "text": "Publication bias was assessed with funnel plots and Egger\u2019s test.\nBoth random-effect and fixed-effect models were used to pool the\ndata, and the two models yielded mainly identical results in our\nanalysis. The results were presented from the random-effect\nmodel. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata software\n(Stata version 11, College Station, Texas).\nResults\nWe identified 769 full-text articles via database searches and 4\nabstracts via manual internet searches through September 30th,\n2012. Of these studies, 233 were from PubMed, 528 from\nEmbase.com, and 8 from Ovid platform. After auto screening was\nperformed using the Endnote program, 260 duplicate articles were\nremoved, and 509 full-text articles were identified by manual\nscreening. Of the 4 abstracts selected, 2 were excluded for lack of\nrelevant data, and the remaining 2 were specific for trials that were\nreported in full-text articles. To obtain as much accurate\ninformation as possible, we contacted five corresponding authors\nregarding the incomplete or vague data available in their\npublished works. Four of these authors kindly replied, but only\none provided additional information that we needed. Three full\ufffetext articles were identified from the databases we listed above but\ndownloaded from Google Scholar. Ultimately, 18 published\nstudies [6,11\u201327] fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Figure 1 shows\nthe study flow regarding trial selection and reasons for exclusion.\nTrial characteristics\nA total 1836 patients between the ages of 18,93 years, with\nCKD at stage 3,5, GFR values ranging from 6,60 ml/min/\n1.73 m2 and no apparent need for dialysis or kidney transplan\ufffetation at baseline, were included. The treatment duration ranged\nfrom 1 to 24 months (median: 6 months). Six of these trials\nexplored the effect of vitamin D on proteinuria, twelve evaluated\nchanges in renal function, and fifteen discussed the incidence of\nhypercalcemia in treated subjects as compared to controls. Two\nother studies compared the effects of newer versus more\nestablished vitamin D compounds in non-dialysis patients\n(Table 2).\nStudy quality\nMost trials in our analysis were of moderate quality. Random\nsequence generation was clearly stated in 10 of 18 trials (56%).\nAllocation concealment was adequate in 5 of 18 trials (28%).\nBlinding of participants and personnel occurred in 12 of 18 trials\n(67%). Blinding of the outcome assessment was reported in 12 of\n18 trials (67%). By contrast, outcome data were provided\nincompletely in 4 of 18 trials (22%), and selective reporting was\nfound in 3 of 18 trials (17%). The likelihood of additional sources\nof bias was as high as 33% for 6 trials, and these related to\ndeclarations of interests or conflicts relating to the commercial\nsource of the funding.\nOutcome measurement\nProteinuria: Six RCTs (685 patients) compared the effects of\nvitamin D versus the use of placebo or no medication. Four of\nthese studies evaluated a newer vitamin D analogue, and the other\ntwo evaluated an established vitamin D compound. The pooled\ndata indicated that vitamin D reduced proteinuria in non-dialysis\npatients (RR, 2.00; 95%CI, 1.42 to 2.81). The RR associated with\nthe newer vitamin D sterol was 1.67 (95%CI, 1.22 to 2.29) and\nthat for the established compound was 2.76 (95%CI, 1.60 to 4.74)\n(Figure 2). The subgroup analysis showed no difference between\nthe newer vitamin D sterol and the established one (P = 0.14). We\nTable 2.
