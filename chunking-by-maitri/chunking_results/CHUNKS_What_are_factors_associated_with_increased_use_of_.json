Deceased-donor \nLT is not frequent but is increasing in Asian countries. Because \ncurrent liver allocation policies follow the severity principle \nwherein patients at highest risk for mortality receive top pri\ufffeority, anesthesiologists may face severely ill patients more fre\ufffequently with deceased-donor LT than with living-donor LT. In \nthis regard, with the outstanding surgical success of recent LT, \ncardiovascular complications have emerged as the leading cause \nof death after LT, particularly among those with advanced liver \ncirrhosis [1,2]. A large national cohort study of the Organ Pro\ufffecurement and Transplantation Network database also revealed \nthat death from cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of \nearly mortality (40%), followed by infection (28%), and graft \nfailure (12%) [3]. Moreover, the numbers of patients receiving \nLT for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [4] and alcoholic liver \ndisease are increasing worldwide.

The incidence of liver disease\nhas risen by 500% over the last 4 decades, however, access to\ntransplantation is limited by the shortage of donor organs1. As a\nconsequence, 240 patients (19%) waiting for liver transplantation\nin the United Kingdom either died or were removed from the\nwaiting list in 2016\u201320172. Data from the United States shows a\nsimilar pattern, comprising 32% of those listed for transplant\n(3629 patients) within 3 years of listing2,3. The demand for liver\ngrafts has driven the wider use of extended criteria donors4.\nHowever, these are associated with an increased risk of primary\nnon-function or delayed failure5\u20139, and the acceptance of these\nhigher-risk organs varies widely10. Because of these inferior\noutcomes, and the difficulty of predicting organ viability, many\npotential donor organs remain unutilised. The high waiting list\nmortality justifies the utilisation of more marginal grafts, but\ncurrent practice requires risk mitigation by matching high-risk\nlivers to lower-risk recipients to achieve patient survival rates that\nare acceptable11. Furthermore, the determination of suitability of\na graft for transplantation largely depends on a surgeon\u2019s sub\ufffejective assessment of the graft\u2019s appearance, using criteria that are\nknown to be unreliable12.\nOrgan preservation currently relies upon cooling to ice tem\ufffeperature to reduce cellular metabolism, and infusing specialist\nsolutions to limit cellular damage. Oxygen deprivation and accu\ufffemulation of by-products of anaerobic metabolism limit the dura\ufffetion of storage and result in ischaemia\u2013reperfusion injury at the\ntime of implantation. This process is more severe in marginal\norgans13. Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) has been\nshown to reduce preservation-related graft injury compared to\nstatic cold storage in transplantable livers, according to current\nselection criteria, in a prospective European trial, which also\ndemonstrated increased utilisation of organs14. In NMP, the liver is\nsupplied with oxygen, nutrients and medication at physiological\ntemperature and pressures, maintaining conditions that support\nhomoeostasis, normal metabolic activity and objective assessment\nof function in real-time. Experimental data have shown that end\ufffeischaemic NMP facilitates replenishment of adenosine tripho\ufffesphate and glycogen levels. Based on increasing clinical experience,\nviability criteria have emerged; these are objective parameters,\nmeasurable during NMP15. Whilst the feasibility of this approach\nhas been demonstrated in a proof-of-concept series, it has not been\nvalidated in a rigorous clinical trial16,17.\nWe therefore conducted this prospective, non-randomised,\nadaptive phase 2 trial in a large single centre, to evaluate the\npotential of NMP to provide objective assessment of the viability\nof livers currently deemed unsuitable for transplantation, and to\ntransplant those that met predetermined criteria. The primary\nclinical objective underlying this project was the increased and\nsafe utilisation of livers which are currently discarded.\nThe trial demonstrates that viability testing with NMP is fea\ufffesible, and the objective assessment enables successful transplan\ufffetation of 71% of perfused discarded livers, with 100% 90-day\npatient and graft survival. The intervention does not seem to\nprevent the development of non-anastomotic biliary strictures in\nlivers donated after circulatory death (DCD) with prolonged\ndonor warm ischaemic times.\nResults\nCharacteristics of discarded liver offers and study participants.\nOver the 16-month study duration from November 2016 to\nFebruary 2018, there were 185 livers discarded for clinical use and\noffered for research.

Using a living donor graft presents several advantages: \nthe programmed and controlled intervention at an optimum \ntime for the recipient, the shorter cold ischemia time and the \nprocurement of a living donor graft with predefined anatomical \nfeatures and, more importantly, of optimal quality. \nThe main hindrance in the development of adult-adult \nLDLT is the risk of morbidity and mortality for donors, which \nraises legitimate ethical questions [8]. These ethical issues have \nbeen carefully considered and discussed by Singer et al. [9], \nwho proposed the criteria by which donors and recipients \nshould be selected. Because of the risks, this technique remains \nmarginal, accounting only for 1% of all transplants performed \nin France currently (14 LDLT including 3 for adult recipients) \n(Table II). While there was only one center that performed adult \nLDLT in 1997 in the USA, this number has gradually increased \nto 38 centers in 2000. The number of adult-to-adult LDLT \nperformed per year increased until the death of a liver donor \nin 2002 sparked a media furor that seriously compromised \nthe pursuit of LDLT programs in the U.S. and significantly \ndecreased the use of this procedure in the following years [10]. \nThe aims of our study were to review the series dealing with \nmorbidity and mortality in LDLT and to identify the strategies \nproposed in the literature for developing LDLT.\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nWe conducted a systematic literature review in order to \nevaluate the morbidity and mortality of the donor in LDLT, \nand to assess the new strategies developed to increase LDLT \npractice.\nA computerized search was made using the Medline \ndatabase from January 2000 to 2017.

        "text": "Liver transplant in so-called high-MELD patients is\nhighly debated because it is associated with significant\nposttransplant morbidity [13, 14]. Importantly, in our\ncenter, transplant selection aims at > 90% one-year sur\ufffevival, which necessitates the exclusion of urgently listing\npatients with decompensation or ACLF. However, there\nare data to suggest that overall survival can be in excess of\n80% and comparable to patients transplanted without\nACLF [12], which is also substantiated in other studies, in\ufffecluding studies of living donor liver recipients [10, 15, 16].\nBy contrast, a retrospective study by Levesque et al.\nshowed in a subgroup of 30 patients with ACLF grade 3 a\n12-month survival rate of 43% after cadaveric liver trans\ufffeplant [11]. These studies clearly highlight that although it\nis worthwhile discussing liver transplant in ACLF grade 3,\nthis must be tempered by assessment of factors that may\nindicate worse outcome after liver transplant, such as in\ufffefections, age, and presence of hepatocellular carcinoma, as\nproposed by Levesque et al. [11]. In addition, patients\nthrough debilitation of their advanced liver disease and a\ncontinued severe inflammatory state, as seen with ACLF,\nwould be expected to be frail and may not be rescued by\nliver transplant [17].\nTo date, interventions such as extracorporeal liver\nsupport, such as the trials with MARS (molecular ad\ufffesorbent recirculation system) [18, 19], have failed to\nshow any clear survival benefit in ACLF 3. When under\ufffetaking consideration for such interventions in such an\nadvanced disease cohort, appropriate resource allocation\nand effectiveness of the intervention must remain major\nconsiderations for implementation. Until there are new\ninterventions with proven efficacy, futility of ongoing\nintensive care support should be discussed early, also\ntaking into consideration that cirrhosis and ACLF repre\ufffesent an increasing health and socioeconomic burden\n[20]. Such early decision-making processes help facilitate\nan appropriate and adequate palliative care option in a\ncohort in whom mortality is high, despite maximal in\ufffetensive treatment support.\nIt is important to note that a CLIF-C ACLF score \u2265 70\nwas associated with distinct clinical features. Notably, the\nSIRS score and WBC count, which are reflective of an in\ufffeflammatory response, were significantly higher in those with\nACLF score \u2265 70, albeit that infections as specific precipitat\ufffeing events were not overrepresented and patients received\nantibiotic treatment as part of the standard procedure. This\nin line with the assertion that increasing disease severity in\nACLF is accompanied by a systemic inflammatory response.\nClaria et al. [21] and others have shown that proinflamma\ufffetory cytokines increase throughout the different severity\ngrades of ACLF and that such inflammation is associated\nwith higher mortality [22\u201324]. This may imply that strat\ufffeegies to lower inflammation and thereby risk of new infec\ufffetion, such as gut decontamination, may improve outcomes,\nbut further clinical trials of such interventions are needed.\nMoreover, it remains to be seen whether these strategies are\ncost-effective in such sick patients.\nThere are some limitations of this study that need\nconsideration. First, this study is a retrospective analysis of\nprospectively gathered data, which may be regarded as a\nweakness because some potential contributory factors that\nmight influence outcome may not have been assessed at\nthe time of enrollment. Second, a further potential limita\ufffetion of this study is that the response to supportive ther\ufffeapy in the ICU was evaluated at 48 hours and not beyond.\nThe previously reported outcomes in ACLF grade 3\npatients in the CANONIC study by Gustot et al. showed\nthat assessment of CLIF-C ACLF score between days 3\nand 7 and a change in score determined longer-term\noutcome. This supports the idea of repeated assessments\nto define futility in such patients, in whom a fixed time of\nassessment may sometimes be difficult [5].",

This study was under\ufffetaken to examine all causes and trends in liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)\namong adults who received liver transplants in the past 10 years.\nMethods\nA national cohort study of all adults who received liver transplants from Jan 1, 2010 to Dec\n31, 2019 recorded in the OPTN STAR database analyzed by etiology of liver disease and\nHCC, and gender.\nResults\nAdult liver transplants increased from 5,731 in 2010 to 8,345 in 2019 (45.6% increase).\nBetween 2010 and 2014, liver disease and HCC associated with hepatitis C (HCV) was the\nmajor cause for liver transplantation. Proportion of liver transplants for HCV associated liver\ndisease and HCC has since decreased to 18.7% in 2019 compared with 44.5% in 2010\n[25.8%, (95% CI 24.3% to 27.3%), p<0.001], while liver transplants for liver disease and\nHCC associated with alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) and non-alcoholic fatty liver\ndisease (NAFLD) increased from 12.7% to 28.8% [16.1%, (95% CI 14.8% to 17.4%),\np<0.001], and from 9.1% to 21.5% [12.4%, (95% CI 11.2% to 13.5%), p<0.001], respec\ufffetively. When all causes of liver disease were examined, only 1.7% of liver transplants had\nunspecified causes. The five major causes of liver disease and HCC among men receiving\nliver transplants in 2019 were ALD (33.1%), HCV (21.9%), NAFLD (18.5%), cholestatic liver\ndisease (5.7%) and hepatitis B (4.9%), while the major causes among women were NAFLD\n(26.8%), ALD (21.1%), HCV (13.1%), cholestatic liver disease (11.1%), and autoimmune\nliver disease (5.6%).\nPLOS ONE\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239393 September 18, 2020 1 / 14\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Wang S, Toy M, Hang Pham TT, So S\n(2020) Causes and trends in liver disease and\nhepatocellular carcinoma among men and women\nwho received liver transplants in the U.S., 2010-\n2019.

        "text": "PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED\nThe LDLT is being established as a general medical\ntreatment of various kinds of end-stage liver diseases.\nOn the other hand, it is thought that the original disease\nrecurrence such as hepatitis C and HCC has influenced\na significant decline in the survival rate of adult cases.\nMoreover, the living donor\u2019s mortality and need of LTx\ndue to a postoperative hepatic insufficiency raised a\ncritical social concern in Europe and the United States.\nAlso in Japan, a living donor\u2019s death was reported in\nMay 2003(5). It is necessary to reevaluate the donor\u2019s\nselection standard and safety anew because of the\nexperience of a donor\u2019s morbidity and mortality. The\nfollowing critical problems remain which should be\nurgently solved: 1) graft size mismatching, 2) ABO\nblood-type incompatible transplantation, 3) the expan\ufffesion of LDLT indication to HCC, 4) the relapse of hepa\ufffetitis C, 5) marginal donors, and 6) the freedom from\nthe immunosuppressants.\n1. Graft size mismatching\nThe minimally required quantity of graft volume has\nnot been fully clarified, which is one of the biggest issues\nof the adult-to-adult LDLT. The following two methods\nexist to express the graft volume : 1) the ratio of graft\nvolume (GV) in the standard liver volume (SLV) of re\ufffecipient, which is calculated by the recipient\u2019s height\nand body weight, and 2) the ratio of graft weight in the\nrecipient\u2019s weight (GRWR ; graft to recipient weight\nratio). The safe limit of small-for-size graft is reported\nto be set from 30% to 40% in GV/SLV(6, 7), while from\n0.6 to 0.8% in GRWR (8, 9). To increase the graft vol\ufffeume, a left lobe graft with a caudate lobe is often used\n(10 -12). As an alternative, an APOLT (auxiliary partial\northotopic liver transplantation) was applied in those\nwho deviate from this safe limit of the graft volume\n(13). From the beginning, the APOLT was expected\nto play a role in providing temporary support for trans\ufffeplant patients with fulminant hepatitis while they were\nwaiting for the regeneration of the native liver. However,\nthis was not generalized from the difficult hepatectomy\nof a morbid liver and possible disease transmission\nfrom the preserved native liver to a new liver graft.\nIn order to conquer this problem (small-for-size graft),\nthe right lobe graft which occupies about two thirds\nof the liver has been frequently used. Herein, the patho\ufffephysiology and cause-oriented strategy are described\nabout a small-for-size graft or a large-for-size graft.\na) Small-for-size graft\nThe patient, who received a small-for-size graft, ex\ufffehibited persistent functional hyperbilirubinemia, in\ufffetractable ascites, graft dysfunction leading to serious\nconditions such as gastrointestinal bleeding and renal\nfailure. (14-16) The characteristic histological findings\nare as follows: hepatocellular ballooning, fatty degen\ufffeeration, hemorrhagic necrosis, and cholestasis around\nthe central vein so called zone 3. We have advocated\nthe following mechanisms for the small-for-size graft :\n1) superfluous portal blood flow, 2) insufficient hepatic\nvenous drainage, 3) absolute shortage of functional\nliver mass, and 4) inappropriate intragraft responses,\nas shown in Fig.4. Against the superfluous portal flow,\nwhich causes sinusoidal endothelial injury immediately\nafter reperfusion (17, 18), the reduction of portal pressure\nor portal flow by splenectomy, splenic artery ligation\n(19-21), or a porto-systemic shunting (22, 23) was rec\ufffeommended. To counteract the insufficient hepatic ve\ufffenous outflow, the venoplasty in a left lobe graft or aggres\ufffesive reconstruction of the venous tributaries from the\nmiddle hepatic vein is performed to prevent graft con\ufffegestion, one of the key factors for a successful outcome\n(Fig. 5)(11, 24). The 3-dimensional computed tomogra\ufffephy(3D-CT) is useful to assess the congestion area\nin the graft prior to operation (Fig. 6). Against the abso\ufffelute shortage of functional liver mass, a hyperbaric\noxygen treatment or intraportal infusion of drugs (25)",
