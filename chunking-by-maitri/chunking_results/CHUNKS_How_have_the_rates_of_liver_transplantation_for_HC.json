The success of liver transplantation has led to an increase in the indications for liver\ntransplantation. Generally, priorities are given to cirrhotic patients with a high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease\n(MELD) score on the principle of the sickest first and to patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on the principle\nof priority points according to the size and number of nodules of HCC. These criteria can lead to a \u2018competition\u2019 on the\nwaiting list between the above patients and those who are cirrhotic and have an intermediate MELD score or with\nlife-threatening liver diseases not well described by the MELD score. For this latter group of patients, \u2018MELD exception\u2019\npoints can be arbitrarily given.\nDiscussion: The management of patients on the waiting list is of prime importance to avoid death and drop out from\nthe waiting list as well as to improve post-transplant survival rates. For the more severe cases who may swiftly access\nliver transplantation, it is essential to rapidly determine whether liver transplantation is indeed indicated, and to\norganise a fast workup ahead of this. It is also essential to identify the ideal timing for liver transplantation in\norder to minimise mortality rates. For patients with HCC, a bridge therapy is frequently required to avoid progression of\nHCC and to maintain patients within the criteria of liver transplantation as well as to reduce the risk of post-transplant\nrecurrence of HCC. For patients with cirrhosis and intermediate MELD score, waiting time can exceed 1 year; therefore,\nregular follow-up and management are essential to maintain the patient alive on the waiting list and to achieve a\ngood survival after liver transplantation.\nConclusion: There is a diversity of patients on the waiting list for transplantation and equity should be preserved\nbetween those with cirrhosis of high and intermediate severity and those with HCC. The management of patients\non the waiting list is an essential component of the success of liver transplantation.\nKeywords: Liver transplantation, Meld score, Hepatocellular carcinoma, Viral hepatitis, Acute on chronic liver failure,\nCirrhosis, Liver transplant waiting list, Alcoholic cirrhosis\n* Correspondence: didier.samuel@aphp.fr\nCentre H\u00e9patobiliaire, Paul Brousse Hospital, University Paris South,\nInserm-Paris South Research Unit 1193, 12 Avenue Paul-Vaillant Couturier,\nVillejuif, 94800 Paris, France\n\u00a9 The Author(s). 2018 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and\nreproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to\nthe Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

The prognosis after recur\uffference is very poor, with reported median survival times\nranging from 9 to 19 months [4, 7\u201311]. No effective\npostoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for HCC after liver\ntransplantation has been established. To date, the best\noutcomes have been achieved by limiting the indications\nfor transplantation according to tumor status. The Milan\ncriteria have become the global standard guidelines for\nliver transplantation for HCC. Nevertheless, rates of\nrecurrence of HCC within the Milan criteria after liver\ntransplantation have been reported to be 1.6\u201313% [1\u20136].\nThe most commonly reported initial sites of local\nrecurrence after liver transplantation for HCC are the\ngrafted liver (15%), lung (20\u201330%), bone (20\u201325%),\nabdominal lymph node (15%), and adrenal glands (5%)\n[2\u20134, 10, 25]. However, the rate of initial recurrence in\nmultiple sites was reported to be approximately 40%\nwhen systemic recurrence is promoted by circulating\ntumor cells; solitary recurrence is very rare, except at\nthose sites [2, 9, 10, 25]. There are seven published cases\nof pharyngeal metastasis from HCC, which are summa\uffferized along with our case in Table 1 [26\u201332]. The re\ufffeports all describe male patients with a median age of 70\nyears (range 49\u201371 years). Four cases of synchronous\nmetastasis and four cases of metachronous metastasis\nhave been reported. The time between the first treat\ufffement and pharyngeal metastasis was 17\u201358 months in\ncases of metachronous metastasis. Five patients, includ\ufffeing our case, underwent surgery for pharyngeal metasta\ufffeses. The prognosis for all cases except ours was poor;\nfour died within 1 year, two underwent difficult curative\ntreatment, and one experienced multiple recurrences of\npharyngeal metastasis at 1 year after surgery [28\u201332]. Our\nreport is the second to describe solitary recurrence in the\npharyngeal region after liver transplantation and includes\nthe longest surviving case of HCC with pharyngeal\nmetastasis.\nThe mechanism of metastasis to the pharyngeal region\nis controversial, although it has been speculated that there\nare two main pathways: tumor cells may circulate through\nthe vena cava and be distributed to the pharyngeal region\nvia the arterial systemic circulation, or may reach the head\nand neck by bypassing the lungs, possibly through the\nportal\u2013vertebral venous plexus (Batson\u2019s theory) [33]. The\nvertebral venous plexus consists of the internal vertebral\nvenous system distributed around the spinal canal, the ex\ufffeternal vertebral venous plexus distributed in front of the\nvertebral body, and the vertebral vein that anastomoses\nboth of those sites. This plexus communicates with the\nintercostal vein and the azygos vein in each site. In the\nhead and neck region, the plexus communicates with the\npterygium venous plexus, cavernous venous plexus, and\npharyngeal venous plexus around the nasal and paranasal\nFig. 3 Clinical course of patient with pharyngeal metastasis after living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\nTacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil were used as posttransplant immunosuppressive agents, with no steroid administration. Epirubicin was\nadministered during surgery. Pharyngeal metastasis occurred at 1 year and 10 months after LDLT. In addition, at 2 years after pharyngeal\npolypectomy, recurrence of HCC was detected in the regional neck lymph nodes. Recurrence subsequently occurred three times in the grafted\nliver, and local treatment with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and radiofrequency ablation therapy were performed.

However, most of the patients with HCC on the\nwaiting list have a compensated liver cirrhosis and a low\nMELD score. Thus, these patients cannot get access to\nliver transplantation through the MELD score. There\ufffefore, patients with HCC on the waiting list will gain\npoints according to the size of the tumour and the num\ufffeber of nodules as well as waiting time duration. There\nare some differences between countries, yet the principle\nis highly similar. In general, no additional points are\ngiven for TNM1 tumours (a single nodule below 2 cm)\nwhere strategies other than liver transplantation should\nbe favoured (i.e. percutaneous radiofrequency, surgical\nresection). In contrast, patients with TNM2 tumours will\ngain points with waiting time. The time between listing\nand transplantation depends on the number of points\ngiven to these patients and may vary according to the\npolicy of the organ-sharing agencies. During this period,\nthe centres should have a strategy to limit or reduce\ntumour growth in order to avoid drop out from the\nwaiting list. It has been shown that a bridge therapy for\nHCC is necessary for projected waiting times of over\n6 months. The treatment of HCC during this period\nmay have a double objective; first, to reduce the size and\nnumber of active tumours in order to place patients\nwithin the criteria for transplantation (downstaging of\nthe tumour) and, second, to reduce and avoid tumour\nprogression. The treatment strategies for HCC may in\ufffeclude percutaneous radiofrequency, surgical resection of\nsome tumour nodules, transarterial chemoembolisation\nand, in some cases, sorafenib [1]. The treatments can be\ncombined according to the type and the progression of\nHCC. Despite these strategies, some patients will drop\nout from the list due to the progression of HCC outside\nthe criteria for transplantation.

The long waiting time\nbetween listing and transplantation has also led to strategies\nfor increasing the donor pool, such as using living donors and\nsplit liver transplantation.17,53 In addition, withdrawal from\nthe waiting list due to disease progression might be reduced\nby use of a locoregional \u201cbridge therapy,\u201d such as TACE or\nablation.54\u201357 There is evidence that response to preoperative\nTACE to \u201cdownstage\u201d HCC led to better long-term survival\nfollowing transplantation, particularly in patients that fit the\nMilan criteria.58,59 Importantly, the number of donors avail\ufffeable for liver transplant has plateaued over the past 10 years\nto \u0001 1500/year for patients with HCC,60 while the number of\npatients with HCC has grown significantly to over 28,000.4\nTherefore, liver transplantation as a treatment for HCC is\nlimited in its scope.\nFor patients who are unsuitable for surgical resection or\nliver transplantation, locoregional therapy using image\ufffeguided percutaneous tumor ablation methods is the treat\ufffement of choice. RFA has demonstrated a superior survival\nbenefit compared with percutaneous ethanol injection in\npatients with early-stage HCC, particularly those with com\ufffepensated liver disease (Child-Pugh A).61 Radiofrequency\nablation was associated with a 5-year OS of 76% when\nused as frontline therapy in patients with resectable HCC\nby BCLC criteria, which is comparable to the survival rates\nachieved historically with surgical resection.62,63 Two pro\ufffespective randomized trials demonstrated that RFA was as\neffective as surgical resection in terms of OS or recurrence\ufffefree survival while being less invasive and having fewer\ncomplications.64,65 These results question the use of surgi\ufffecal resection as standard first-line therapy in all patients\nwith very early-stage HCC, and support consideration of RFA\nin this setting. However, RFA has several limitations and\nshowed suboptimal results in patients with tumor\nsize > 3 cm and perivascularly located tumors.66 To over\ufffecome these limitations, numerous refinements of ablation\nmethods are under clinical testing, including laser ablation,\nmicrowave ablation, cryoablation light-activated therapy,\nand irreversible electroporation.\nIntermediate-Stage HCC\nPatients with large multimodal tumors, preserved liver func\ufffetion, and no vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread who are\nineligible for radical surgical therapies or percutaneous abla\ufffetion are usually treated with TACE.17 Transarterial chemo\ufffeembolization involves the intra-arterial injection of a\ncytotoxic agent (doxorubicin, cisplatin, or mitomycin), with\nor without lipiodol, plus an embolic agent into the hepatic\nartery that supplies the tumor. In a meta-analysis of seven\nstudies, TACE demonstrated a significant improvement in\n2-year survival (odds ratio \u00bc 0.53; p \u00bc 0.017) compared with\nbest supportive care.67 However, patient selection appears to\nSeminars in Liver Disease Vol. 33 Suppl. 1/2013\nS6 Multidisciplinary Management of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Marrero",

        "text": "Background\nLiver transplantation plays a major role in the thera\ufffepeutic path of liver diseases [1]. It concerns all patients\nwith end-stage liver disease when other medical therap\ufffeies have failed as well as a high number of patients with\nprimary liver cancer, mainly hepatocellular carcinoma\n(HCC). The success of liver transplantation over the past\nyears has been considerable, with more than 5000 being\nperformed annually in Europe, surmounting to more\nthan 140,000 liver transplantations in total [2]. Such suc\ufffecess comes as a consequence of the absence of alterna\ufffetive therapies and of the good post-transplant survival of\napproximately 90 and 80% at 1 and 5 years, respectively.\nIn Europe, liver donors are mainly of cadaver origin,\neither following brain death or cardiac arrest, under the\nMaastricht 3 procedure [1]. In contrast to living donor\ntransplantation, where the date of liver transplantation is\nknown in advance, in cadaveric donor liver transplant\ufffeation the date of liver transplantation is unknown.\nTherefore, the wait for transplantation can vary from a\nfew days in the case of acute liver failure patients to\nmore than 1 year for patients with cirrhosis of inter\ufffemediate severity or those with HCC. The waiting lists\nfor liver transplantation are composed of three types of\npatient. (1) Those with acute liver failure, included, in\nmost countries, in a super-emergency waiting list giving\nthem absolute priority over all other recipients, and re\ufffeceiving a transplant within hours or days [3]. (2) Those\nwith decompensated liver cirrhosis, included in the wait\ufffeing list on the principle of the \u2018sickest first\u2019, based mainly\non the calculation of the Model for End Stage Liver\nDiseases (MELD) score. Those with very high MELD\nscore may likely access liver transplantation within days\nor a few weeks, whereas those with intermediate or low\nMELD scores will access liver transplantation within\nmonths or even years. (3) Those with HCC on compen\ufffesated liver cirrhosis. Organ-sharing agencies assign these\npatients an artificial score according to the number and\nsize of tumours, providing them access to liver trans\ufffeplantation within a maximum of 18 months. Since the\nnumber of candidates on the waiting list is greater than\nthe offer of viable livers, there is some degree of compe\ufffetition between patients. Liver centres should manage\ntheir patients according to their clinical situation and\nthe expected waiting time for liver transplantation. For a\npatient with an end-stage liver disease, the procedure of\nliver transplantation and the postoperative period re\ufffemain a heavy procedure. Therefore, patients should be\ncarefully prepared physically and mentally to undergo\ntransplantation, much like an athlete preparing for the\nOlympic games. The management of patients on the\nwaiting list is essential to avoid death or drop out due to\ndeterioration of their condition as well as to ensure that\npatients are in the best physical condition possible prior\nto the procedure \u2013 this is essential for the success of the\npost-operative course.\nManagement of patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis\nIn the USA, the MELD score has been implemented since\n2002 as a score to prioritise access to liver transplantation\n[4]. Most countries in Europe have implemented the\nprinciple of the \u2018sickest first\u2019 to prioritise such access also\nbased on the MELD score, despite some differences be\ufffetween countries. The principle of the \u2018sickest first\u2019 is one\nof justice and has achieved a reduction in mortality whilst\non the waiting list in most countries. However, there are\nseveral inherent issues that must be addressed.\nFirst, the MELD score, calculated from bilirubin, cre\ufffeatinine and international normalised ratio levels, is not\nthe holy grail [4\u20136]. Some patients with severe liver dis\ufffeeases are poorly represented by the MELD score, such\nas, for example, patients with cholestatic diseases, who\nhave, until the very late stage, a low MELD score due to",

These criteria, which were\nsoon termed the \u201cMilan criteria,\u201d became the worldwide\nbenchmark for liver transplantation criteria for HCC.\nThe Milan criteria, limiting the indications for liver\ntransplantation for HCC, have reduced the postoperative\nrecurrence rate of HCC. However, HCC still recurs in\n1.6\u201313% of recipients within the Milan criteria after liver\ntransplantation [1\u20136]. There have been many reports of\ncases with multiple instances of recurrence due to sys\ufffetemic recurrence caused by extra-hepatic circulating\ntumor cells. The prognosis after recurrence of HCC is\npoor, with reported median survival ranging from 9 to\n19 months in major transplant centers in both Western\nand Eastern countries [4, 7\u201312]. However, if the recur\uffference remains local, such as within the liver, lung, or ad\uffferenal gland, surgical resection may improve prognosis,\nand cases of long-term survival have been reported [4,\n6\u20138, 10, 11, 13].

The right lobe of the donor\nwas harvested and weighed 710 g (graft-to-recipient\nweight ratio, 1.09). The donor and recipient had the\nsame blood type.

Consistent with the known association with insulin\nresistance, 49.1% of patients with NASH cirrhosis listed for LT\nwere diabetic compared with 22.1% of all other registered\npatients (although the criteria for the definition of DM were not\nwell defined).\nINDICATIONS FOR LIVER TRANSPLANTATION IN NASH\nRELATED CIRRHOSIS\nGiven that LT is a relatively recently identified indication for\npatients with NASH, data for long term follow-up are more\nlimited compared with LT for other causes of chronic liver\ndisease. Nevertheless, data from several American centres\nsuggest that patients with NASH do not have an inferior\noutcome 1, 2 and 5 years after LT when compared with other\naetiologies of liver disease.25e27\nThere are no data to suggest that the natural history of\ncirrhosis after an initial clinical decompensation or the rate of\nchange of Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score differ\nfor patients with NASH compared with other causes of\ncirrhosis. Hence the current recommendation should be that\nthere are no disease specific indications for listing for LT in\nthis condition and that those currently useddthat is, MELD\nscore and/or specific variant indications (eg, diuretic resistant/\nintolerant ascites)dshould remain. In those patients with HCC\non the background of NASH related cirrhosis, there are no data\nto support modification of the general criteria for listing for LT.\nMany patients with end stage liver disease have a presumptive\ndiagnosis of NASH. Patients may have a longstanding history or\nDM/hypertension with no other obvious reason for cirrhosis\nother than presumed previous NASH. Generally, when such\npatients present with liver decompensation they do not undergo\nliver biopsy, hence the need for standardisation of diagnosing\nNASH. As such, in the absence of a histological diagnosis of\nNASH, the presence of cirrhosis with a clinical phenotype\ncompatible with underlying NASH, as defined by the presence of\nthree or more components of the metabolic syndrome28 prior to\nLT, is sufficient.\nRecommendation 1: Criteria for diagnosis of NASH should\ninclude an established clinical and histological diagnosis of\nNASH on liver biopsy, or a histological diagnosis of cryptogenic\ncirrhosis with a clinical phenotype compatible with underlying\nNASH, as defined by the presence of three or more components\nof the metabolic syndrome prior to LT.

        "text": "However, Facciuto et al [11] reported that 5-year survivals of 35%\nfor HCC patients beyond Milan criteria, and Fong et al. [4],\nreported 3-year and 5-year survivals of 48% and 33%, respec\ufffetively, for patients with tumors greater than 5 cm. One\nexplanation for this discrepancy is that a large proportion of\nHCC in our series were within Milan criteria. The 1-, 3- and 5-\nyear survival rates were 90, 81, and 72% and 1-, 3- and 5-year\nrecurrence rates of 11, 25, and 31% in the primary LT group,\nwhich showed reduced incidence of recurrence and improved\nsurvival compared to LR group. In fact, similar results had been\nobserved by some previous studies [26\u201328]. However, the choice\nof a particular treatment option would depend on individual liver\nfunction and availability of a donor liver in the setting of shortage\nof donor organs. Our purpose was not to compare two treatment\ngroups, but to ascertain the outcome of a combined strategy\nemploying prior LR and salvage LT for HCC meeting UCSF\ncriteria.\nMoreover, LR has several advantages for patients with HCC\nmeeting UCSF criteria and well-preserved liver function. First, LR\nis technically far less complex than LT and can be performed\nwithout delay. Second, for patients with HCC meeting UCSF\ncriteria and well-preserved liver function, LR would achieve\nrecurrence-free, long-term survival in nearly a half of patients in\nour series, and a half of grafts are saved for the community and\ncan be transplanted to other patients who have no other\nalternative. Last but not least, patients with HCC beyond Milan\ncriteria are at higher risk of disease progression and higher\ndropout rate on waiting list [29]. LR could achieve initial control\nof the tumor and decrease dropout rate, leaving salvage LT as a\nreserve option to manage recurrence.\nThe Milan criteria [7] for HCC have been widely used as the\nguideline for the selection of candidates for LT in many\ntransplantation centers. In recent years, some investigators have\nargued that the Milan criteria are too restrictive and limit the\ntransplant option at a time when the incidence of HCC is\nincreasing. Several recent series have demonstrated good out\ufffecomes using expanded criteria (the UCSF criteria), with long-term\nsurvival similar to Milan criteria [18,30\u201332]. Similar results were\nobserved in our study. In the present report of 219 patients\nmanaged in a single institution, LT is confirmed as appropriate\nand effective treatment for patients with HCC meeting UCSF\ncriteria, with 1, 3, 5-year survival rates of 89%, 80%, 69% and 1,\n3, 5-year recurrence rates of 12%, 24%, 32%, respectively.\nSalvage LT, which was first proposed by Majno et al [8], is\nrestricted to patients who develop recurrence within Milan criteria\nand could represent a loss of opportunity for the subgroup of\npatients who develop recurrence beyond Milan criteria. Recently,\nKaido et al [15] reported that the selection criteria for salvage LT\nto treat recurrent HCC could be expanded to Kyoto criteria\n(tumor number #10, the maximal diameter of each tumor was\n#5 cm and serum des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin levels of\n#400 mAU/mL). However, the patient cohort in their study was\nsmall and the Kyoto criteria was based on salvage LDLT. As\nmentioned above, LT for HCC within UCSF criteria could\nachieve excellent long-term survival similar to Milan criteria.\nNevertheless, little is known about outcomes for salvage LT in\npatients with recurrent HCC within UCSF criteria after LR.\nHence, a study about salvage LT for recurrent HCC within UCSF\ncriteria was of great value. Here, we found favorable short- and\nlong-term outcomes in 39 patients who underwent LT for\nrecurrent HCC meeting UCSF criteria after LR.\nAlthough the intraoperative blood loss and required blood\ntransfusion were more frequent than primary LT group, the\noperation time was not prolonged in salvage LT group. Moreover,\nthe perioperative mortality and posttransplant complications were\nsimilar in the salvage and primary LT groups. The larger volume",
