        "text": "[29,30]. Spitzer et al. [30] concluded that steatosis should\nbe added to the DRI, when dealing with a high-risk\ndonor. However, objective evaluation of the range of\nsteatosis, either as macro- or microvesicular steatosis, is\nnot standardized so far subjective to some degree [29].\nWe believe that routine donor biopsy evaluation may en\ufffeable the design of more powerful and robust donor risk\nscores.\nWe believe that the prognostic power of the DRI and\nET-DRI is further significantly undermined by the fact\nthat graft acceptance decisions on offered organs for\ntransplantation are not documented and evaluated in\nthese scores. There is an urgent need to evaluate and ad\ufffedress this shortcoming immediately, especially on the\nbackground of the current liver transplant scandals in\nGermany [23,31]. We believe that this aspect is a rele\ufffevant issue in liver transplantation today. Transplant cen\ufffeters regard their graft acceptance policy as their\npotential advantage in a highly competitive area for a\nvery scarce resource in times of ubiquitous organ short\ufffeage. It can be assumed that these aspects of potentially\nunwanted transparency by the proponents of transplant\ufffeation stood in the way of previous attempts to generate\nrobust prognostic scores that include donor organ qual\ufffeity. This may represent a deeper reason for the notorious\ndifficulty to assess donor organ quality and its impact on\nprognosis after transplantation objectively.\nThe balance of equity and utility in donor organ allo\ufffecation is a serious ethical dilemma. Several risk predic\ufffetion models are available and their head to head\ncomparisons would benefit from standardized reporting\nand formal, consistent statistical evaluation [18,26]. It\nwas claimed previously and in a different context that\noutcome selection and optimism biases may affect litera\ufffeture on prognostic scores in medicine [26].\nWe would like to propose joint efforts to develop a ro\ufffebust and objective donor risk score in an international\ncollaboration that should include the available large\ndata-sets from multiple institutions. We believe that the\ntime has come for a consensus on the reporting of the\nreasons for declined organ offers and on quality stan\ufffedards for prognostic scores and their statistical analysis\nand validation. Jacob et al. [18] proposed a reasonable\nscientific approach to the latter. High quality scientific\njournals should make uniform requirements mandatory\nfor the reporting of prognostic scores.\nConclusion\nThe results of this current study clearly show that the\nET-DRI is not applicable in the population from our\ncenter within the Eurotransplant community for the pre\ufffediction of patient or graft survival. On the background\nof a paucity of proper prognostic models, justified organ\nallocation which weighs urgency against prediction of\nsuccess of liver transplantation must be the aim of future\nresearch in this field.\nPatients and methods\nEthics statement\nAs an observational retrospective study, according to the\nProfessional Code of the German Medical Association\n(article B.III. \u00a7 15.1), neither informed consent nor ap\ufffeproval of the ethics committee was needed for this\nstudy.\nPatients\n291 consecutive liver transplants were included to\nanalyze the model\u2019s accuracy and applicability for this\ndataset of a major transplant centre in the Eurotrans\ufffeplant community.

Other changes\nwere similarly graded in a semiquantitative manner.\nResults\nPEROPERATIVE BIOPSIES\nAbnormalities were invariably present in the per\ufffeoperative biopsy specimens, although these were usu\ufffeally unimportant. All seven showed centrilobular\nhepatocyte vacuolation and necrosis. In four cases\nthere was bridging necrosis and frank subcapsular\ninfarction. All the histological changes seen in these\nbiopsies improved on subsequent biopsy, although\ntwo cases showed persistent centrilobular necrosis or\nfibrosis, or both (cases 1 and 2). The severity of\nchanges seen in peroperative biopsy specimens was\nnot related to the cold ischaemic time.\nPOSTOPERATIVE BIOPSIES\nHistological changes of rejection were seen between\nsix days and five months after transplantation\n(Table 2).\nPORTAL INFLAMMATION AND BILE DUCT\nDAMAGE\nAcute rejection was characterised by a dense mixed\nportal inflammatory infiltrate composed mainly of\nlymphocytes and neutrophils with smaller numbers of\n1367\nplasma cells, macrophages, and eosinophils. A partic\ufffeularly striking finding was the presence of poly\ufffemorphs surrounding and infiltrating the epithelium of\nsmall bile ducts and ductules (Fig. 1). This was associ\ufffeated with a variable degree of nuclear hyper\ufffechromatism and cytoplasmic vacuolation of the bili\ufffeary epithelium. These acute changes were seen in nine\nbiopsy specimens taken six to 18 days after trans\ufffeplantation.\nIn one patient (case 2) the acute bile duct lesion was\nfollowed by complete loss of ducts on the 28th day\nafter transplantation (Fig. 2) and led to graft failure\nnecessitating retransplantation. In another patient\n(case 1) acute inflammation subsided, but bile duct\nepithelium showed severe focal atypia resembling that\nseen in graft v host disease (Fig. 3).8 In the remaining\nfive cases treatment with immunosuppression resulted\nin clinical improvement and resolution of histological\nchanges, although a residual, mild and predominantly\nmononuclear infiltrate persisted in all these cases.\nThe hepatectomy specimen removed for chronic\nrejection (case 2) showed complete absence of small\nbile ducts. Larger ducts showed features similar to\nthose noted in smaller ducts in previous biopsies with\nthe additional finding of numerous foamy histiocytes\nin surrounding connective tissue (Fig. 4). A small\namount of material resistant to diastase and positive\nfor periodic acid Schiff was present in their cyto\ufffeplasm, but fat stains yielded a negative result.\nTable 1 Clinical details ofpatients and timing of biopsies after transplantation\nCase Age and Original diagnosis No of Timing of biopsy Follow up\nNo sex biopsies (day after graft)\nI O.L. 10 40 F Primary biliary cirrhosis 2 90, 102 Died at 5 months\n2 O.L. 15 41 F Primary biliary cirrhosis 3 15, 28, 56 Regraft at 2 months and\nalive at 9 months\n3 O.L. 18 46 F Primary biliary cirrhosis 3 7, 28, 38 Alive at 5 months\n4 O.L. 19 40 F Primary biliary cirrhosis 3 6, 20, 28 Alive at 5 months\n5 O.L. 21 35 F Cryptogenic cirrhosis 4 15, 18, 30, 42 Alive at 4 months\n6 O.L. 22 15 F Cryptogenic cirrhosis 2 7, 48 Alive at 2 months\n7 O.L. 24 15 M al antitrypsin deficiency 4 6, 12, 16, 40 Alive at 2 months\nTable 2 Histologicalfindings in 21 biopsies taken after transplantation\nFeatures assessed Degree of abnormality\nMild or moderate Severe\nPortal changes:\nInflammation 12 9\nPolymorphonuclear infiltration of biliary epithelium 5 9\nVascular changes:\nArterial intimal hyperplasia 3 0\nPortal vein endothelial inflammation 8 3\nCentral vein endothelial inflammation 3 2\nLobular changes:\nCholestasis 7 11\nCentrilobular necrosis or fibrosis 5 0\nAcidophil bodies (solitary) 10 0\n(clusters) 3 0\nPolymorph aggregates 4 0\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n.

We have \nshown evidence of progressive accumulation of bile salts in the perfu\ufffesate of livers with high post-transplant transaminase levels; something \nthat also correlates with poor bile production during NMP. The extent \nand nature of the injury required to produce this effect is not clear but \ndoes appear to reflect organ quality rather than viability.\nHigh-risk organs (for example, those with steatosis) may benefit from \ntherapeutic interventions delivered during NMP: several groups are \nexploring potential strategies, including stem cell treatments, de-fatting \nagents and immunological modification of the organ. Future trials \nmay be needed to formally test the size of the effect of NMP on organ \nutilization; for this it will be necessary to randomize livers at the time \nof organ offering rather than the time of retrieval. Organ utilization, or \norgan utilization with 12-month graft survival (functional utilization) \nwould be a logical primary endpoint for a study of this sort.\nThis study describes the formal clinical evaluation of a novel tech\ufffenology in liver transplantation, and could herald the start of a new era \nof intervention during organ preservation.

Finally, allogeneic rejection is most\nprobably the main cause for the observed decline of cell graft\nfunction within 1 year of HT (19). Although the safety of\nclinical HT has been very well established, therapeutic benefit\nhas been modest and only temporary so far. This is partially in\ncontrast with very convincing preclinical results obtained in a\nnumber of animal models of liver disease (2\u20134), possibly\nbecause these models do not properly mimic the disease in\nhumans. Animals usually develop liver injury within a few days\nor weeks, whereas in humans the injury is significantly more\nsevere occurring over many decades, thus highlighting a need\nof more realistic models of liver disease.\nPROCEDURES: HEPATOCYTE SOURCE, ISOLATION, QUALITY\nCONTROL, AND ADMINISTRATION FOR CELL\nTRANSPLANTATION\nHuman hepatocytes are isolated from (i) whole donor livers\nunsuitable/rejected for OLT, mostly because of severe\nsteatosis, prolonged ischemia time, older, or non-heart\ufffebeating donors, or (ii) from liver segments, mainly I and\nIV, which are available for cell isolation after split liver\ntransplantation. Alternatively, fetal and neonatal livers are\nbeing explored as a potential cell source (23,24) as they are\ncurrently not considered for OLT and may allow the isolation\nof very high-quality cells (9). Neonatal-derived hepatocytes,\nalthough not fully mature, show activity of some of the main\nenzymes responsible for hepatic-detoxifying functions (23).\nExplanted livers from patients with liver-based metabolic\ndisorders have also been considered as a potential source of\ncells. This concept was adopted from a similar approach used\nin the so-called \u201cdomino\u201d liver transplantation performed\nsince the mid-1990s, in which a liver transplant recipient with\na known metabolic defect can donate his explanted native\nliver for use as liver graft in another patient (25). In a similar\nway, liver explants from patients with defined metabolic\ndisorders could become a source of hepatocytes, since their\nmissing enzymatic function would be performed by the\nrecipient\u2019s native liver, left in place. This approach was used in\na 6-year-old boy with severe phenylketonuria transplanted\nwith hepatocytes isolated from a glycogen storage type 1b\nliver explant, with significant reduction of blood phenylala\ufffenine levels up to 3 months after transplantation (13).\nIn order to isolate the hepatocytes, a standardized three-step\ncollagenase perfusion technique originally developed by Berry\nand Friend and later modified (26\u201328) is used. First, major\nhepatic vessels are cannulated and perfused with Hank\u2019s buffered\nsalt solution (HBSS) containing EGTA, which is able to chelate\ncalcium ions, thus disrupting the desmosomes, calcium\ufffedependent cell-to-cell adhesions. Second, the liver is flushed\nwith plain HBSS to remove any residue of EGTA. Third, the\ntissue is perfused with a calcium-dependent collagenase solution\nto digest the extracellular matrix. After breaking of the liver\ncapsule, the released liver cells are filtered and centrifuged at low\nspeed to separate hepatocytes from nonparenchymal cells.\nHepatocytes can be used fresh for transplantation or cryopre\ufffeserved. Several protocols have been described to cryopreserve\nhuman hepatocytes, with the best results being achieved\ncryopreserving 106\n\u2013107 cells/ml in the University of Wisconsin\norgan preservation solution containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide\nand 5% glucose, and using a controlled-rate freezer (29).\nCryopreserved hepatocytes are then stored at \u2013140 \u00b0C until\nrequired for HT. Hepatocyte isolations for use in clinical HT\nmust be performed under good manufacturing practice (GMP)\nin an aseptic and accredited units.\nEvaluation of hepatocyte quality before transplantation is\nvital, especially on cryopreserved cells, as it has been shown\nthat freeze-thawing cycles damage mitochondria, affect cell",

        "text": "Additionally, for patients with HCV-related end-stage \nliver disease, another study in Egypt provided evidence \nthat administration of MSCs followed by granulocyte col\ufffeony stimulating factor (GCSF) mobilization is excellent \nfor liver stem cell therapy to retain liver mass and restore \nliver functions [18]. In summary, the above large con\ufffetrolled trials demonstrated that MSCs play a supportive \nrole in the treatment of liver failure and show satisfactory \ntolerability and beneficial effects on liver synthetic func\ufffetions and hepatic fibrosis resolution.\nMSC therapy for\u00a0complications of\u00a0liver transplantation\nOrthotopic liver transplantation is the only curative \nmeasure for patients with end-stage liver failure. How\ufffeever, the risk of complications after liver transplantation \nis still high, even with increases in surgical expertise. \nTwo of the most common complications following liver \ntransplant are rejection and infection. MSCs offer new \ntherapeutic opportunities to prevent and treat solid \norgan transplant rejection. A recent pilot study demon\ufffestrated that UC-MSC therapy can alleviate liver dam\ufffeage and improve allograft histology in liver transplant \npatients with acute graft rejection who did not respond \nto immunosuppressive agent dose adjustments. However, \nthe study was not carried out long enough to determine \nwhether decreased infection resulted from MSC infusion \n[19].\nHowever, in the same year, Detry et\u00a0al. [20] enrolled \n10 liver transplant patients to receive MSCs infu\ufffesion and another 10 patients acted as controls. It was \nshown that no difference in the overall rates of rejec\ufffetion or graft survival was observed between the MSC \ninfusion group and the control group. And Month-6 \nbiopsies did not demonstrate a difference between \ngroups. The study indicated that the immunosuppres\ufffesion weaning in MSC recipients was not successful. \nThe results are completely different and contradictory \ncompared to those of the above pilot study. We ana\ufffelyze that the possible reason might be that the aim and \nexperimental design of the two studies were different. \nThe pilot study aimed to examine the clinical feasibil\ufffeity of MSC infusion as a therapeutic option for liver \nallograft rejection, and all patients were treated with",

        "text": "donor shortage [6]. This shortage in PHHs might be\nresolved with the emergence of human induced pluripo\ufffetent stem cells (hiPSCs), which could provide an\nunlimited source of hepatic-like cells (HLCs) [7, 8].\nhiPSC-HLCs have been used for engraftment in a liver\ninjury model and to repair injured liver tissue [9];\nhowever, following engraftment, it took weeks for\nhiPSC-HLCs to start producing detectable levels of spe\ufffecific proteins and exhibit hepatic function [10]. Because\nof the rapid deterioration of liver function and extensive\ntoxic substance accumulation [1], the treatment window\nfor ALF patients is very narrow, and the extended time\nperiod needed for engraftment with hiPSC-HLCs might\nnot be suitable for ALF therapy. Therefore, transplants\nthat can assume hepatic functions with little delay are\nrequired for ALF treatment.\nTransplantation of in vitro-generated organoids can\nregenerate functional tissue in vivo and might be a po\ufffetential approach for ALF treatment [11]. Previous stud\ufffeies have developed a macro-liver organoid (macro-LO)\nfrom hiPSCs with endothelial cells (ECs) and mesenchy\ufffemal cells (MCs) that can grow into vascularized,\nfunctional tissue post transplantation by recapitulating\nevents that occur in early liver organogenesis [12, 13].\nHowever, the three types of cells necessary for LO gener\ufffeation were derived from three different donors with dif\ufffeferent HLA types, and thus would not match any\nparticular patient\u2019s HLA for clinical application. Clinical\nliver transplantation studies have found that incompat\ufffeible HLA matching between the graft and the patient is\nassociated with increased mortality and graft loss in ALF\npatient therapy [2]; therefore, LOs derived from a single\ndonor cell should be developed to match specific\npatients\u2019 HLAs. Single donor-derived cells have the same\nhost genetic background and thus may recapitulate liver\norganogenesis more accurately to support LO differenti\ufffeation. Additionally, the LOs reported previously were\nstill at an immature stage, and they required 2 weeks to\ndifferentiate and exhibit hepatic function with human\ufffespecific albumin (ALB) production in vivo [12]. How\ufffeever, for ALF therapy, transplants that can immediately\nexhibit hepatic function in vivo are urgently needed [14],\nand functional LOs are thus considered to hold promise.\nTherefore, functional LOs generated from single donor\ncells are expected to be useful for ALF therapy.\nTo generate functional single donor cell-derived\n(SDC)-LOs for clinical application, all three types of cells\n(hiPSC-endoderm, ECs, and MCs) should be obtained\nfrom the same donor with high purity and few genomic\nmutations. Human somatic cells accumulate nuclear and\nmitochondrial genomic mutations over the course of\ntheir lifespan [15]; thus, cells obtained from newborns\nwould be expected to have fewer mutations than adult\ncells. ECs and MCs that have been used for LO\ngeneration are derived from newborn umbilical cords\n(UCs) and adult bone marrow (BM), respectively [12, 13].\nThe isolation of MCs from newborn BM requires an inva\ufffesive procedure that would cause harm to the newborn, so\na replacement MC source from the same newborn is thus\nnecessary for SDC-LO generation. The newborn UC is an\nimmature tissue with a large number of MCs that can be\nisolated without invasive procedures [16], and UC-derived\nMCs have characteristics similar to those of BM\ufffederived MCs (BM-MCs) [16]. Therefore, ECs and MCs\nderived from the same UC might be useful for generating\nfunctional SDC-LOs with the same donor-derived hiPSCs.\nIn this study, we obtained ECs and MCs from a single\ndonor UC and investigated the role of single donor\ufffederived ECs and MCs in LO generation and differenti\ufffeation. We also generated hiPSCs from the same donor\nto provide a hiPSC-endoderm source for LO generation.\nUsing these three types of cells, we generated functional\nSDC-LOs for ALF therapy.\nMethods\nEC and MC isolation and culture\nUnder the permission of the Ethical Review Board of",
