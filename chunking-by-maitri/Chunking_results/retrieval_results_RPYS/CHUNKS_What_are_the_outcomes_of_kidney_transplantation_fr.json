In order to examine how these policy shifts\nhave affected overall deceased organ donor (DD) and DBD rates, we analyzed deceased donation rates from 82 countries\nfrom 2000\u20132010. On average, overall DD, DBD and DCD rates have increased over time, with the proportion of DCD\nincreasing 0.3% per year (p = 0.01). Countries with higher DCD rates have, on average, lower DBD rates. For every one-per\nmillion population (pmp) increase in the DCD rate, the average DBD rate decreased by 1.02 pmp (95% CI: 0.73, 1.32;\np,0.0001). We also found that the number of organs transplanted per donor was significantly lower in DCD when\ncompared to DBD donors with 1.51 less transplants per DCD compared to DBD (95% CI: 1.23, 1.79; p,0.001). Whilst the\nresults do not infer a causal relationship between increased DCD and decreased DBD rates, the significant correlation\nbetween higher DCD and lower DBD rates coupled with the reduced number of organs transplanted per DCD donor\nsuggests that a national policy focus on DCD may lead to an overall reduction in the number of transplants performed.\nCitation: Bendorf A, Kelly PJ, Kerridge IH, McCaughan GW, Myerson B, et al.

Reliably measuring\nthe warm ischaemic period is difficult outside of hospital,\nwhich means that the use of livers from uncontrolled DCD\ndonors is limited.2 In contrast, planned withdrawal of life\ufffesustaining treatment in Maastricht III donors enables close\ncardiorespiratory monitoring, provision of a prepared pro\ufffecurement team and minimisation of subsequent warm\nischaemia. As such, the use of livers from controlled DCD\ndonors has risen dramatically in the USA3 and Europe.4\nUS registry analyses have demonstrated that DCD liver\ntransplantation has worse graft and patient survival than\nDBD liver transplantation.5\u20139 This is thought to be pre\ufffedominantly due to a higher rate of biliary complications\nin DCD livers than other causes of graft loss.10\nRecognition of these issues has perhaps contributed to a\nrecent drop in the number of DCD livers transplanted\nin the USA.3 11 However, as a result of encouraging early\nreports12 and decreasing DBD liver transplantation rates,\nthe use of DCD livers in the UK is now more widespread\nthan in the USA.\nAs there are differences between UK and US practice\nwith respect to how DCD livers are being used,13 14\nwe\nreport in this article graft loss and recipient mortality\nafter transplantation of DCD and DBD livers in the UK.\nTwo risk-adjustment techniques were used to control for\ndifferences in donor and recipient risk factors.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nInclusion criteria\nUsing data submitted to the UK Liver Transplant Audit,15\nwe identified all adult patients (aged >16 years) receiving a\nfirst liver transplant in the seven UK transplant centres\nbetween 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2010. Follow-up\nceased on 31 March 2011. Regular checks indicate that\ndata are consistently more than 93% complete and accur\ufffeate.16\u201318 Patients receiving living or domino donors were\nexcluded, as were those having an emergency (\u2018super\nurgent\u2019\n19) or multiorgan transplant. We are not aware of\nany uncontrolled DCD liver transplants having been per\ufffeformed in the UK during the study period.\nDonor and recipient selection and organ procurement\nCriteria for DCD donor selection and acceptable post\ufffewithdrawal haemodynamic parameters varied among the\nliver transplant centres, but were broadly based on the\nexperience of Muiesan et al,\n12 and in line with US guide\ufffelines.19 Administration of heparin or vasodilators, or pre\ufffedissection of femoral vessels before death, is prohibited\nby law in the UK. Death was declared after cardiorespira\ufffetory arrest with a minimum interval of 5 min. All UK\nliver procurement centres used a super-rapid recovery\ntechnique,19 although preservation fluid type, bag pres\ufffesure and the use of dual perfusion techniques varied.\nLivers from DCD and DBD donors were allocated\nlocally, and centres chose recipients according to local\ncriteria.20 Optimal livers from DBD donors were offered\nto paediatric centres for splitting and implantation of\nthe left lateral segment, with implantation of the\nextended right lobe into an adult recipient.\nStatistical analyses\nPearson\u2019s \u03c72 test was used to identify differences of cat\ufffeegorical variables and Student\u2019s t test or Mann-Whitney\ntest for differences of continuous variables.

Email: s.large@nhs.net.\nFifty years since the first successful human heart transplant from a non-heart beating donor, this concept of \nheart transplantation from donation after circulatory determined death (DCD) promises to be one of the \nmost exciting developments in heart transplantation. Heart transplantation has established itself as the best \ntherapeutic option for patients with end-stage heart failure, with the opportunity to provide these patients \nwith a near-normal quality of life. However, this treatment is severely limited by the availability of suitable \ndonor hearts. In recent times, heart transplantation has been limited to using donor hearts from donors \nfollowing brain stem death. The use of donor hearts from DCD had been thought to be associated with high \nrisk and poor outcomes until recent developments in organ perfusion and retrieval techniques have shown \nthat this valuable resource may provide an answer to the global shortage of suitable donor hearts. With \nestablished DCD heart transplant programmes reporting encouraging results, this technique has been shown \nto be comparable to the current gold standard of donation after brain death (DBD) heart transplantation. \nKeywords: Heart; transplant; circulatory death\nSubmitted Jan 11, 2018.

Despite being such an effective therapy, its \nutilization is limited by the short supply of suitable donor \nhearts. In the United Kingdom (UK), only 27% of hearts \nfrom donors following brain stem death [donation after \nbrain death (DBD)] that are offered are eventually accepted \nfor transplantation. Unfortunately, this translates to 43% of \npatients on the heart transplant waiting list either dying or \nbecoming too sick to be suitable for a heart transplant (1).\nTo a d d r e s s t h e i n c r e a s i n g d e m a n d f o r h e a r t \ntransplantation, the heart transplant community were forced \nnot only to extend the acceptability criteria for DBD hearts \nbut also to re-explore heart transplantation using hearts \nfrom donation after circulatory determined death (DCD). \nUntil recently, anxieties concerning the unquantifiable \nwarm ischemic injury to the myocardium following cardiac \narrest coupled with the inability to assess function of the \nasystolic heart have been major hurdles preventing further \nattempts at transplanting DCD hearts.

        "text": "While most countries rely upon DBD for the vast majority of\norgans retrieved from deceased donors, in certain situations, some\norgans can be recovered from patients whose hearts have recently\nstopped beating. This procedure, which is known as donation after\ncardiocirculatory death (DCD), involves careful coordination of\nthe time of asystole with the commencement of organ retrieval.\nAnd while transplant outcomes for DCD livers are generally\npoorer than those recovered from DBD donors [9], DCD kidneys\nshow similar graft survival rates to DBD [10] and DCD lung graft\nsurvival rates may eclipse those of DBD [11]. Although complex,\nand at times controversial [12], [13], [14], DCD provides an\nadditional pathway for obtaining much needed donor organs.\nIn an attempt to define standardized methodologies appropriate\nfor DCDs, the First International Workshop on DCD held in\nMaastricht in 1995 defined four categories of DCD [15]. These\nare:\nCategory I: Dead on Arrival (Uncontrolled (uDCD))\nCategory II: Unsuccessful Resuscitation (Uncontrolled (uDCD))\nCategory III: Awaiting Cardiac Arrest (Controlled (cDCD))\nCategory IV: Cardiac Arrest While Brain Dead (Controlled\n(cDCD))\nWhile suggestions have been made that many Category III\nDCD donors might become brain dead were they allowed to\nprogress [16], [17], Category III DCD is, by far, the most widely\npracticed [18].\nIn the last 10 years there has been a marked worldwide increase\nin the number of countries that have adopted policies promoting\nDCD. A recent study, prepared on behalf of European Committee\non Organ Transplantation, identified 10 countries in Europe that\nhave adopted or are in the process of adopting policies to promote\nthe use of DCD [18]. The United States and Canada have both\nvigorously pursued DCD policies [19], [20], [21], and in Latin\nAmerica, DCD donation has also been reported in Bolivia, Brazil\nand Colombia. In Australia, the Commonwealth Government\nrecently allocated large amounts of funding [22] to support\nstrategies aimed at improving its consistently low deceased organ\ndonation rates, including the adoption of policies that promote\nDCD [23].\nWhile it has generally been assumed that DCD provides an\neffective pathway toward increasing donation rates, the impact\nthat DCD has had on deceased organ transplantation rates and\nDBD rates worldwide has generally not been quantified. In this\nstudy, we analyzed deceased donation (DD) rates from 2000\u20132010\nfor 82 countries that have reported results to international organ\ndonation bodies to determine what effect policy shifts to increase\nDCD rates have had on deceased organ transplantation and DBD\nrates.\nMethods\nRates for deceased solid organ donation and transplantation,\nDBD and DCD (both uncontrolled DCD (uDCD) and controlled\n(cDCD)) were collected from: the Agence de la Biome\u00b4decine, the\nCouncil of Europe, Eurotransplant, the International Registry of\nDonation and Transplantation (IRODaT), Nederlandse Trans\ufffeplantatie Stichting, the NHS Blood and Transplant Organisation,\nthe Organizacio\u00b4n Nacional de Trasplantes (ONT) and the United\nNetwork of Organ Sharing (UNOS)/US Organ Procurement and\nTransplantation Network (OPTN), for countries that reported\norgan transplantation activity for the period of 2000\u20132010\n(Appendix S1).\nCountries were categorized into three groups, according to the\nnumber of deceased donations recorded annually.

Eleven studies were included for meta-anal\ufffeyses on three different treatment strategies.

Introduction\nDue to the persistent shortage of organs available for solid organ\ntransplantation [1], the transplant community has been searching for\npossibilities to further expand the donor pool. One way to achieve this\nis by accepting organs retrieved from older and higher risk donors,\nwithout compromising good transplantation outcomes. Improving\nquality of suboptimal organs from donors after brain death (DBD),\nolder expanded-criteria donors (ECD), or donors after circulatory\ndeath (DCD) mandates better assessment and optimisation prior to\ntransplantation. These donors have all suffered cerebral injury, which\nleads to a profound systemic inflammatory response [2, 3]. Further\ufffemore, DBD and DCD donors face additional disturbances that threaten\nthe quality of the future organ grafts.\nIn DBD donors, an increased intracranial pressure impairs brain per\ufffefusion and causes herniation of the brain stem. This results in the release\nof catecholamines and a cascade of derangements that lead to endothe\ufffelial dysfunction and inflammation in the potential grafts-to-be [4, 5]. In\naddition, the function of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland becomes\nimpaired, which leads to decreased cortisol, triiodothyronine (T3), insu\ufffelin, and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) plasma levels in the donor [6, 7].\nAfter herniation of the brain stem, a haemodynamically unstable state\nwill follow that requires fluid resuscitation and often inotropic support.\nIn DCD donors, there is no catecholamine release. Instead, withdrawal of\nmedical support results in a significant blood pressure drop until circu\ufffelatory arrest. This period of circulatory arrest is followed by a in most\ncountries medico-legal five-minute no-touch period prior to confirma\ufffetion of death, which adds extra warm ischaemic injury and threatens",

Compared with standard criteria donor(SCD) kidneys,\nkidneys from ECDs can be associated with a higher rate of delayed\ngraft function(DGF), primary non-function(PNF),acute rejection\nand a more complicated postoperative course, resulting in inferior\nlong-term graft survival overall [7\u201310]. Although ECD kidneys\nhave an overall 1.7 times greater risk for graft failure [3], it has also\nbeen shown that transplantation of these kidneys has a significant\nsurvival benefit when compared with dialysis treatment[11],\nespecially for elderly recipients [12].\nTo maximize the benefit of donated kidneys, two kidney\npreservation methods have been developed over the past 30 years,\nnamely hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) and static cold\nstorage (CS)[13]. Static cold storage, with solutions designed in the\n1980s, remains the gold standard in kidney transplantation.\nHowever, it has been reported that SC was unable to fully protect\nECD kidneys, while HMP could mitigate the deleterious effects of\nCS, reducing the incidence of DGF for ECD kidney transplan\ufffetations [14,15].\nTo better understand whether HMP could obtain better\noutcomes in ECD kidney transplantation compared to CS, We\nconducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available\nstudies. We assessed the impact of HMP on rates of DGF, PNF\nand one-year graft and patient survival. These data could help\nclinical transplant professionals to decide the best way to preserve\nECD kidneys.\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 December 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 12 | e81826",
