The use of VADs as a bridge to transplant \nin the pediatric population has continued to increase \nsignificantly and currently over 50% of pediatric patients \nbeyond the infant age group are transplanted from VAD \nsupport (2) (Figure 9). These patients can often be mobile \nand undergo physical and nutritional rehabilitation while \nawaiting transplantation, which has likely contributed to the \nreduced waitlist mortality (12,13) without compromising \npost-transplant survival (Figure 10). However, serious \nmorbidity including stroke, bleeding, infection and device \nmalfunction remains common (14). As depicted in Figure \n9, more infants require ECMO support, especially those \nwith congenital heart disease, with the resultant suboptimal \noutcomes (13,15).

The diagnosis before transplantation \nalso affects survival; congenital heart disease continues to \nbe associated with a significantly higher early mortality \ncompared to cardiomyopathy (2,7). Interestingly, the \noverall survival of cardiomyopathy patients by 3 years post\ufffetransplant was 88% compared to 79% for patients with \ncongenital heart disease but this difference was negated \nby 10 years post-transplant with 70% and 68% survival \nrespectively (1) (Figure 13).

Intra-aortic balloon \npumps are no longer routinely recommended for cardio\ufffegenic shock114. A range of new percutaneous ventricular \nassist devices are available, in addition to extracorporeal \nmembrane oxygenation (ECMO). These techniques can \nbe used as a bridge to recovery or for longer-term support, \nand differ not only in terms of their technical aspects, \nbut the degree and type of support provided (LV and/or \nRV support, with or without the addition of respiratory \nsupport)115\u2013120. Echocardiography is critical for successful \nimplementation of acute MCS121,122 (TABLE\u00a02). MCS is not \na treatment per\u00a0se, but instead a supportive therapy for \npatients awaiting treatment or resolution of the under\ufffelying pathological process. As\u00a0in all cases of AHF, the \nmost important role of echocardiography is to diagnose \nthe underlying cardiac cause. When the decision to \ninstitute MCS is made, echocardiography is then used \nto corroborate the decision regarding the type and level \nof support required. Although clear echocardiography \nparameters have been used to guide longer-term MCS \nfor both the left and right heart123,124, these parameters \nare not yet available for devices designed for short-term \nuse. Furthermore, clear contraindications to MCS exist \nthat can be diagnosed only using echocardiography. \nEchocardiography is used in the initiation of MCS, \nincluding the use of vascular ultrasonography to guide \nsafe vessel cannulation and steer device or cannula \nplacement. Echocardiography is subsequently used to \nmonitor MCS by ensuring the goals of support are met, \nand for detecting complications and assessing tolerance \nto assistance121. Unfortunately, peripheral ECMO can \nparadoxically worsen cardiac function by increasing \nLV afterload. Although a number of echocardiographic \nparameters exist that might indicate this complica\ufffetion (including lack of aortic valve opening, biphasic \nretrograde flow across the mitral valve\u00a0in diastole, and \nretrograde systolic pulmonary venous flow; FIG.\u00a07), the \ninherent limitations of echocardiography in estimating \nLAP and LVEDP, especially when the heart is partially \nbypassed, makes this strategy particularly challenging122. \nEchocardiography can be used, however, to guide inter\ufffeventions to ensure that the heart is adequately offloaded. \nTable 3 | Proposed initial focused cardiac and lung ultrasonography assessment for patients with suspected AHF in acute care setting\nClinical question Structural and \nfunctional \nassessment\nViews (2D imaging) Comments Evidence\nFocused echocardiography131,132\nAlternative \ndiagnoses for \npatient\u2019s signs and \nsymptoms?\n\u2022 Pericardial effusion\n\u2022 RV dilatation/\nsystolic function\nSubxiphoid, parasternal \nlong-axis and \nshort-axis views, apical \nfour-chamber view\nAbsence of RV \ndilatation/dysfunction \ncannot exclude the \npresence of pulmonary \nemboli\n\u2022 Pericardial effusion: sensitivity up to 100%, \nspecificity 95% for detection of pericardial \neffusion133,134\n\u2022 RV dysfunction (various criteria): sensitivity 74%, \nspecificity 54% for diagnosis of acute PE19\nEvidence of \nimpaired systolic \nfunction?\nGlobal LV systolic \nfunction\nSubxiphoid, parasternal \nlong-axis and \nshort-axis views, apical \nfour\u2011chamber view\nMight be useful in \nnew-onset HF for \nidentification of \nreduced EF\nSensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of AHF \ndepending on prevalence of HFrEF38,135\nIs there (additional) \nevidence of \nvolume overload?\nIVC assessment IVC (subxiphoid) IVC collapsibility <50% Sensitivity 83%, specificity 81% for diagnosis \nof\u00a0AHF in patients with dyspnoea in the ED135\nGross structural \nabnormality as \nAHF aetiology?\n\u2022Gross valvular \nabnormality*\n\u2022 Intracardiac mass\u2021\nSubxiphoid, parasternal \nlong-axis and \nshort-axis views, apical \nfour-chamber view\nAHF aetiology might be \nidentified in rare cases\nNA",

The remaining patients had other forms \nof UCHD or a morphologic systemic left ventricle. There \nwere several important findings from this study. First, 70% \nof patients achieved a positive outcome over 6 months \nwith 21% successfully bridged to transplant. More than \n50% of patients remained alive on the device. Second, \nthe mortality in the ACHD patients was predominantly \nin patients undergoing biventricular support or receiving \nthe total artificial heart. These patients were more often \nINTERMACS class 1 or 2, indicating that they were \nmore high risk at the time of device implant with more \nend organ dysfunction. Third, ventricular morphology \nand the presence of UCHD were not predictors of poor \noutcome. But only 17 of the 126 patients had a UCHD \ndiagnosis (44). The central message of the report was that \nwith proper patient selection, a positive outcome is more \noften the case when using mechanical circulatory device or \nsupport in ACHD patients. With this in mind, others have \nsuggested that it may be time to lower the threshold for use \nof mechanical circulatory support in this patient population, \nand that the poor results of the past may be due to the \nhesitation to place devices in these patients allowing them \nto become more ill (i.e., INTERMACS 1) (44). Finally, \nthere may be an age advantage when considering mechanical \ncirculatory support in ACHD patients. Rizwan et al. found \nthat the lowest post-transplant survival of bridged congenital \nheart disease patients was between 15 and 29 years of age. \nPatients older than 30 years of age that were bridged to \ntransplant, had improved post-transplant outcomes, and the \npost-transplant survival was comparable to those who were \nnot bridged to transplant with a VAD (45). \nSurgical considerations\nThe transplant operation for ACHD patients is a challenging \nanatomic and physiologic undertaking. Patients presenting \nwith previous Fontan reconstruction often require additional \nsurgical procedures at the time of organ implantation. In \nthis population, pulmonary artery, systemic venous, and/or \ngreat artery reconstruction are common additional surgical \nprocedures (46). The need for reconstruction of the branch \npulmonary arteries needs to be assessed prior to listing. This \ncan be accomplished using cardiac catheterization or CT \nangiography. The author\u2019s approach is to obtain a CT scan for \nre-operative cases. This aid not only in planning additional \nsurgical reconstructions but is also useful for planning \nsternal re-entry. Knowing whether or not pulmonary artery \nreconstruction is necessary may impact the type of donor \ntaken. For example, one may consider avoiding donors where \nthe lungs are being harvested so that the donor pulmonary \nartery may be used for reconstruction of the recipient \npulmonary arteries at the time of organ implantation. The \ndonor pulmonary artery can be used as a free homograft (47) \nor as a patch. However, lung retrieval is not an absolute \ncontraindication to utilizing a particular donor organ, because \nthe pulmonary arteries can be reconstructed with synthetic \npatches, though this is not ideal. The need for pulmonary \nartery reconstruction may also impact the anastomotic \nsequence during organ implantation. The author\u2019s preference \nis to reconstruct the branch pulmonary arteries prior to the \nascending aorta reconstruction. This allows for uninhibited \nhilum-to-hilum access to the branch pulmonary arteries.",

The European Union also has great dif\ufffeficulty obtaining hearts for people in need, and \nalmost every transplant candidate there gets \nmechanical support for some time. The gap \nbetween those listed for transplant and the \nnumber transplanted each year continues to \nwiden in both the United States and Europe. \nAll transplant candidates are assigned a\nstatus by the United Network of Organ Shar\ufffeing (UNOS) based on their medical condi\ufffetion. The highest status, 1A, goes to patients \nwho are seriously ill, in the hospital, on high \ndoses of inotropic drugs (specific dosages are \ndefined) and mechanical circulatory support \nsuch as an LVAD, and expected to live less \nthan 1 month without a transplant. Status \n1B patients are stable on lower-dose inotropic \ntherapy or on mechanical support, and can be \nin the hospital or at home. Status 2 patients \nare stable and ambulatory and are not on ino\ufffetropic drugs. \nIn July 2006, UNOS changed the rules on \nhow patients are prioritized for obtaining an \norgan. The new rules are based both on sever\ufffeity of illness (see above) and geographic prox\ufffeimity to the donor heart\u2014local, within 500 \nmiles (\u201czone A\u201d) or within 500 to 1,000 miles \n(\u201czone B\u201d).

Since the change, only 8% \nof hearts nationwide go to status 2 patients, \nwhich is 67% fewer than before. At the same \ntime, organs allocated to status 1A patients \nhave increased by 26%, and their death rates \nhave fallen.3\nThe new allocation system is a positive\nchange for the sickest patients, providing \nquicker access and a reduction in waiting-list \nmortality.13 The drawback is that status 2 pa\ufffetients who are less ill are less likely to ever re\ufffeceive an organ until their condition worsens. \nHeart transplant outcomes \nare publicly reported \nThe Scientific Registry of Transplant Re\ufffecipients publicly reports heart transplant \noutcomes (www.srtr.org).

However, from \na health-economics perspective, it did highlight that the \npercentage conversion of hearts perfused on the OCS that \nproceeded to transplantation was higher in those who had \nbeen assessed on NRP, allowing for a significant cost-saving. \nMore recently, a timely study published by Messer et al.\ncoinciding with the 50th anniversary of heart transplantation \nfurther confirms these findings (23).

In a matched comparison, they found \nno significant difference in survival with a reported 92% \n90-day survival in the DCD group (n=26) with no \ndifferences in intensive care duration, length of hospital stay \nor the need for mechanical support. Interestingly, they did \nreport better early cardiac function of the DCD allografts \ncompared with the matched DBD cohort.\nEthical considerations\nThe use of NRP is not possible in certain countries due \nto the many varying legal definitions of death that exist \nglobally. In the UK, current practice is based on the code \nof practice guidelines published by the Academy of Medical \nRoyal Colleges (20). These guidelines allow for the use \nof NRP and for perfusion of the heart to be restarted \nwithin the donor provided that cerebral circulation is not \nrestored. There are other legislative differences that exist \nin the process of declaration of death internationally. In the \nUK, a period of 5 minutes after mechanical asystole has \nto be allowed prior to the declaration of death, whereas in \nAustralia this time period varies between 3 to 5 minutes \nand in the paediatric cohort in Colorado was reduced to \n75 seconds. Furthermore, the use of ante-mortem \ninterventions such as ante-mortem heparin, while \nroutinely practiced for DCD retrievals in some countries is \nunacceptable in the UK. \nCo-location of the donor and recipient, while an \nexceptionally rare occurrence, has been intentionally \nemployed to facilitate paediatric DCD transplantation (17). \nHowever, this is not a strategy that is routinely acceptable \nin many other countries on ethical and logistic grounds \ndespite the proposed clinical benefits. \nFuture work\nAlthough DCD heart transplantation has been shown \nto be a viable source of good quality donor hearts, there \nremains a lot of work that needs to be done to optimise \nthis resource and allow patients to fully benefit from this \nprocedure. Significant work has already been done in \nusing post-conditioning agents on an ex-situ platform of \nperfusion to allow for better post-transplant outcome using \npharmacological agents which has already translated into \nclinical practice (24). However, apart from using NRP, \nthere remains significant doubt on the reliability of organ \nassessment on the OCS which is currently based on the \nuse of lactate as a surrogate for organ quality together \nwith flow parameters (25,26). Additionally, as with DBD \ntransplantation, primary graft dysfunction (PGD) remains \nan issue and the platform of ex-situ perfusion allows for an",

Multiple devices exist across a spectrum from\nmodest to complete support, and each is associated with unique risks.\nIn this review, we summarize existing data on complications\nassociated with the three most widely used acute MCS platforms: the\nintra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), Impella systems, and veno-arterial\nextracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO). We review\nevidence from available randomized trials and highlight challenges\ncomparing complication rates from case series and comparative\nobservational studies where a lack of granular data precludes\nappropriate matching of patients by CS severity. We further offer a\nseries of best practices to help shock practitioners minimize the risk of\nMCS-associated complications and ensure the best possible outcomes\nfor patients.\nKeywords\nSafety review, cardiogenic shock, acute mechanical circulatory\nsupport, impella, ecmo, intraaortic balloon pump\nOpen Peer Review\nApproval Status\n1 2\nversion 1\n29 Jul 2020\nFaculty Reviews are review articles written by the\nprestigious Members of Faculty Opinions.
