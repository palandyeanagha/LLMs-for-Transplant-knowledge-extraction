Up until\nthat point, the number of transplantations performed was\never-increasing, and the outcomes continued to improve. The\nclinical benefit to the patient from the immediate and effective\ntreatment of organ failure was defined by improved patient\nsurvival. Patient survival as an endpoint followed by graft survival\nas a surrogate and indicator of judicious organ attribution\nwere the framework of significant momentum that succeeded\nin making transplantation a standard of care. This success\nwas fueled, however, not only by the healthcare quality gain\nbut also by a flourishing industry producing high-quality and\nexpensive immunosuppressive medication\u2014to be taken for life\nafter transplantation (1\u20133).\nThe honeymoon period came to an end when both donor\nrates and short-term results stagnated. The established endpoints\nfor clinical trials are difficult to improve in the short run\nafter transplantation, and the field was slow in anticipating\nand responding to the changing circumstances\u2014specifically\nthe shortage of standard criteria donors (SCD). The field of\ntransplantation now finds itself in very difficult circumstances:\n90%+ patient and graft survival rates leave little room for\nimprovement but also little room for error. At the same\ntime, the conditions and circumstances in organ donation are\nradically changing, with increasing donor age and comorbidities\nand donation from non-heart-beating donors. In countries\nspearheading the evolution, donation after cardiac death (DCD)\nand extended criteria donor (ECD) organs make up more than\n50% of the organ pool. With the pressure to maintain and further\nimprove the excellent short- and long-term results, but working\nwith very different resources, the most prominent immediate\nchallenge is to better define and preserve, if not improve, organ\nquality in transplantation.\nAbbreviations: A2AR, Adenosine A2A receptor; AST, Aspartate\naminotransferase; ATP, Adenosine triphosphate; CIT, Cold ischemia time;\nCMV, Cytomegalovirus; CVA, Cerebrovascular accident; DAMP, Danger\ufffeassociated molecular pattern; DBD, Donation after brain death; DC, Dendritic\ncell; DCD, Donation after cardiac death; DGF, Delayed graft function;\nD-HOPE, Dual hypothermic oxygenated perfusion; DRI, Donor Risk Index;\nEAD, Early allograft dysfunction; ECD, Expanded criteria donor; ECMO,\nExtracorporal membrane oxygenation; EMS, Exsanguinous metabolic support;\nESP, Eurotransplant senior program; ET-1, Endothelin-1; EVLP, Ex vivo lung\nperfusion; FABP, Fatty Acid- Binding Protein 1; GFP, Green fluorescent protein;\nGST, Glutathione S-Tranferases; H-FABP, Heart-type fatty acid-binding protein;\nHOPE, Hypothermic oxygenated perfusion; HMP, Hypothermic machine\nperfusion; HMPO, Oxygenated hypothermic machine perfusion; IFN\u03b3, Interferon\ngamma; IL-10, Interleukin-10; IRI, Ischemia-reperfusion injury; KDRI, Kidney\nDonor Risk Index; LDH, Lactate dehydrogenase; MP, Machine perfusion; MSC,\nMesenchymal stromal cells; NAG, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase; NMP,\nNormothermic machine perfusion; NK, Natural killer cell; NKT, Natural killer\nT cell; NRP, Normothermic regional perfusion; OCS, Transmedic Organ Care\nSystem; PDR, Pancreas Donor Risk Index; PGD3, Prostaglandin D3; PNF, Primary\nnon-function; PV, Pressure volume; RCT, Randomized controlled trial; ROS,\nReactive oxygen species; SCD, Standard criteria donor; SCS, Static cold storage;\nSOFT, Survival Outcomes Following Liver Transplantation score; SOP, Standard\noperating procedure; SOT, Solid organ transplantation; TNF-\u03b1, Tumor necrosis\nfactor \u03b1; UNOS, United Network for Organ Sharing; VEGF, Vascular endothelial\ngrowth factor; WIT, Warm ischemia time.\nWith this as a driving force, modalities to prolong and\nimprove preservation together with the tools to assess organ",

These mainly rely \non the potential reduction of organ donations because of the \npublic perception that a graft is offered to patients who were \nactively drinking just before admission to the waiting list, with \nan increased risk of post-transplant alcohol relapse. However, \navailable data shows that, when a strict selection process is \napplied to this special population of patients, relapse rates are \ncomparable to those reported in ALD patients who underwent \nLT after 6month of pre-transplant abstinence.67 82 83 Further \nstudies are ongoing to confirm these preliminary results.84 Lastly, \na strong variability exists in terms of access to LT for sAH, with \ndifferences that are evident also at a national level with a poten\ufffetial inequity among patients with the same disease. This issue \nneeds to be resolved through the development of international \nand national consensus on criteria for listing and transplanting \npatients with sAH.85 In Italy, patients with sAH can be consid\ufffeered potential candidates for LT only if strict criteria are met, as \nrecently published in a position paper.77 The first Italian expe\uffferience was reported by Germani et al86 who evaluated patients \nadmitted for sAH at the Multivisceral Transplant Unit of Padua \nUniversity Hospital (between January 2013 to June 2018).

Onaca [16], in a small study (44 cases) investigating RETs,\ncarried out at about 2 years after the first transplant, showed a\nbetter 2-year survival for \u2018\u2018early\u2019\u2019 (81%) than for late (50%) RETs.\nIn our series this result is ambiguous: indeed, despite there are\nbetter long term survivals (Log-Rank test, p = . 02) for late relative\nto early RETs, this difference becomes evident only after three\nyears from RET. Consequently, we believe that early and late\nRET are both justified by survival results.\nMoreover, because of reported conflicting data concerning\nRET for HCV recurrence or for other causes, we explored this\nissue only considering late whole grafts and no difference in\nsurvival was found.\nThe UNOS Status (a classification in four classes of patients\naccording to their clinical conditions before surgery) and the state\nof emergency related to RET, have been correlated to RET\noutcome by several authors [11,14]: the worse results were\nassociated with greater emergency. This observation was con\ufffefirmed by our study, where the UNOS status was statistically\nsignificant at univariate analysis of data on the first RETs (Log\ufffeRank test, p = .003).\nRecent observations suggests that the MELD score represents a\ngood prognostic predictor of survival after RET. Ravaioli et al.\n[17] in 2004 separated their series of RET (n = 87) according to\nthe MELD score at the time of RET. Patients were devided into\ntwo groups based on a MELD score .25 and ,24.

If possible, the Hosmer\ufffeLemeshow Chi2\n-statistic goodness-of-fit test was applied\nto assess model calibration of the binary logistic regres\ufffesion models. These statistics suggest good fit when the\nassociated p-values are greater than 0.05 [21,25].
