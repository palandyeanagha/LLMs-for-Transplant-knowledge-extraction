The use of VADs as a bridge to transplant \nin the pediatric population has continued to increase \nsignificantly and currently over 50% of pediatric patients \nbeyond the infant age group are transplanted from VAD \nsupport (2) (Figure 9). These patients can often be mobile \nand undergo physical and nutritional rehabilitation while \nawaiting transplantation, which has likely contributed to the \nreduced waitlist mortality (12,13) without compromising \npost-transplant survival (Figure 10). However, serious \nmorbidity including stroke, bleeding, infection and device \nmalfunction remains common (14). As depicted in Figure \n9, more infants require ECMO support, especially those \nwith congenital heart disease, with the resultant suboptimal \noutcomes (13,15). Mechanical support options for single \nventricle patients and outcomes pre- and post-transplant \nremain poor (7).\nPost-transplant outcomes\nThe most recent analysis from the ISHLT registry shows \na median survival of 22.3 years for those <1 year of age at \ntransplantation, 18.4 years for those 1 to 5 years, 14.4 years \nfor those 6 to 10 years and 13.1 years for those >11 years\u2014\nnumbers that continue to improve almost annually \n(Figure 11). Remarkably, survival to 10 years in the most \nrecent era conditional on survival to 1 year post-transplant \nis now 83% for all age groups <10 years at transplantation \n(1,2) (Figure 12). The diagnosis before transplantation \nalso affects survival; congenital heart disease continues to \nbe associated with a significantly higher early mortality \ncompared to cardiomyopathy (2,7). Interestingly, the \noverall survival of cardiomyopathy patients by 3 years post\ufffetransplant was 88% compared to 79% for patients with \ncongenital heart disease but this difference was negated \nby 10 years post-transplant with 70% and 68% survival \nrespectively (1) (Figure 13). Single ventricle patients with \nprior staged surgical palliation fare worse with 53% 10-year \nsurvival (7). Myocarditis continues to be associated with \na worse post-transplant outcome with survival of 83% at \n1 year and 65% at 3 years post-transplant (16). Some other \nfactors that have been shown to affect 1-year mortality \ninclude ECMO, being on a ventilator or dialysis at the time \nof transplant, other markers of renal insufficiency (creatinine \nand glomerular filtration rate), recipient body mass index, \nrecipient total bilirubin, ischemic time, and transplant \nFigure 9 Percent of pediatric heart transplant recipients bridged with mechanical circulatory support by age group and diagnosis \nJanuary 2009 to June 2016 (from the registry of the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation.

Although bridging with ECMO\nis generally associated with a greater perioperative risk\nand poorer long-term survival [21], ECMO allows\nactively deteriorating and severely ill patients with end\ufffestage lung disease to remain eligible for lung\ntransplantation.\nDuring the last decade, several studies aimed to evaluate\nsurvival outcomes between bridge-ECMO patients and\nnon-bridge-ECMO patients to demonstrate the efficacy of\nusing ECMO as a bridge strategy. Toyoda et al. detected\nno survival difference between the bridge-ECMO group\n(n = 24) and non-bridge-ECMO group (n = 691) of 74%\nversus 83%, respectively, at 1 year after transplantation\n[22]. Schechter et al. showed that 1-year survival was not\ndifferent between bridge only with ECMO patients and\ncontrol patients (70.4% versus 84.2%) [23]. In contrast,\nInci et al. showed worse overall and 3 month conditional\nsurvivals in the bridge-ECMO group (n = 26) versus the\nnon-bridge-ECMO group (n = 160) (68% versus 85%, p =\n0.001; 86% versus 92%, p = 0.03, respectively) [15]. In the\npresent study, the 6-month mortality of all patients was\n24.1% and there was no significant difference between the\nbridge-ECMO group and non-bridge-ECMO group in this\nrespect (33.3 and 21.2%, P = 0.304). The strength of our\nstudy is that recent, multi-institutional data for lung trans\ufffeplantation and a large sample of bridge-ECMO patients\nwere included. These results indicate that bridging with\nECMO is effective for patients awaiting lung transplant\ufffeation due to the recent evolution of ICU care and ECMO\nmanagement.\nIn this study, we also provide valuable information\nabout short-term post transplantation outcomes. Despite\ntechnical improvements, ECMO is associated with risks of\ncomplications including hemolysis and need for transfu\ufffesion, cardiovascular dysfunction, bleeding due to anticoa\ufffegulation, and thrombosis formation. Furthermore, ICU\nadmission for ECMO management leads to ICU-acquired\nweakness and infection associated with catheter or ICU\ncare [24, 25].

Currently at Cleve\ufffeland Clinic, more LVADs are implanted than \nhearts are transplanted. \nMechanical circulatory support is indi\ufffecated for patients who are listed for transplant \nto keep them functioning as well as possible \nwhile they are waiting (bridge to transplant). \nFor others it is \u201cdestination therapy\u201d: they are \nnot candidates for a transplant, but a device \nmay improve and prolong the rest of their life. \nCase 2: \nA good outcome despite a poor prognosis\nA 71-year-old man was rejected for transplan\ufffetation by his local hospital because of his age \nand also because he had pulmonary artery \nhypertension (78/42 mm Hg; reference range \n15\u201330/5\u201315 mm Hg) and creatinine elevation \n(3.0 mg/dL; reference range 0.6\u20131.5 mg/dL). \nNevertheless, he did well on a mechanical de\ufffevice and was accepted for transplantation by \nCleveland Clinic. He received a transplant \nand is still alive and active 14 years later. \nComment. Determining that a patient is \nnot a good transplantation candidate is often \nimpossible. Putting the patient on mechani\ufffecal support for a period of time can often help \nclarify whether transplantation is advisable. \nProbably most patients who receive mechani\ufffecal support do so as a bridge to decision: most \nare acutely ill and many have organ dysfunc\ufffetion, pulmonary hypertension, and renal in\ufffesufficiency. After a period of support, they can \nbe assessed for suitability for transplantation. \nLVADs continue to improve\nMany devices are available for mechanical cir\ufffeculatory support.14 In addition to LVADs, there \nare right-ventricular assist devices (RVADs), \nand devices that simultaneously support both \nventricles (BiVADs). Total artificial hearts are \nalso available, as are acute temporary percu\ufffetaneous devices. These temporary devices\u2014\nTandemHeart (CardiacAssist, Pittsburgh, PA) \nand Impella (Abiomed, Danvers, MD)\u2014can \nbe used before a long-term mechanical device \ncan be surgically implanted.\nLVADs are of three types:\n\u2022\t Pulsatile volume-displacement pumps, which \nmimic the pumping action of the natural \nheart. These early devices were large and \nplaced in the abdomen.\n\u2022\t Continuous axial-flow pumps, which do \nnot have a \u201cheartbeat.\u201d These are quieter \nand lighter than the early pumps, and use a \nturbine that spins at 8,000 to 10,000 rpm.\n\u2022\t Continuous centrifugal-flow pumps. These \nhave a rotor spinning at 2,000 to 3,000 \nrpm, and most of them are magnetically \npowered and suspended. \nThe superiority of LVADs over medical \ntherapy was clearly shown even in early stud\ufffeies that used pulsatile LVADs.15 The results of \nsuch studies and the increased durability of the \ndevices have led to their rapidly expanded use.\nThe newer continuous-flow pumps offer\nsignificant improvements over the old pulsa\ufffetile-flow pumps, being smaller, lighter, quieter, \nand more durable (TABLE 1). A 2007 study of \n133 patients on a continuous axial-flow LVAD \n(HeartMate II) found that 76% were still alive \nafter 6 months, and patients had significant \nimprovement in functional status and quality \nof life.16 In a postapproval study based on reg\ufffeistry data, HeartMate II was found superior to \npulsatile pumps in terms of survival up to 12 \nmonths, percentage of patients reaching trans\ufffeplant, and cardiac recovery. Adverse event \nrates were similar or lower for HeartMate II.17 \nAnother study compared a continuous\ufffeflow with a pulsatile-flow LVAD for patients",

        "text": "no cancer [20]. The question remains whether the predicted\n2-year survival is of sufficient duration for a paradigm shift\nfrom transplant to destination therapy. Maximal follow-up\nof patients on continuous-flow device destination therapy\nis currently only exceeding little more than 2 years and\nthere is uncertainty about long-term survival [20]. In con\ufffetrast, follow-up after heart transplantation now extends to\nalmost 30 years, with excellent long-term survival [1]. In\naddition to survival, other outcome measures such as qual\ufffeity of life and functional capacity will have to be com\ufffepared between patients on continuous-flow device destina\ufffetion therapy and transplant patients in order to further de\ufffetermine the role of lifetime mechanical circulatory support\nin heart failure therapy. Therefore, a prospective, controlled\ntrial is suggested randomising selected patients to heart\ntransplantation versus destination therapy. The results of\ncontinuous-flow implants have improved sufficiently that\nsuch a study can be ethically justified. In this discussion\nof destination therapy versus heart transplantation, one has\nto keep in mind that, since the REMATCH trial was per\ufffeformed, there has been no randomised comparison of sur\ufffevival and functional status with modern LVADs against\ncontemporary medical therapy. Such a trial would also be\nof particular interest, because, parallel to the advancement\nof LVAD technology, outcomes with ambulatory cardiac\nfailure have improved with targeted use of medical treat\ufffement, resynchronisation therapy, and cardiac failure man\ufffeagement.\nDestination therapy in \u201cless sick\u201d\npatients before they are typical\ntransplant candidates\nThe success of continuous-flow devices has raised the\nquestion, regarding if the \u201cless sick\u201d heart failure patients\nshould be a target for VAD therapy [21]. However, data\nfrom current trials would not justify implantation of\nLVADs into patients with class III symptoms. Traditionally,\ndestination therapy has been limited to those advanced\nheart failure patients who are not eligible for transplant\ufffeation, have less than 2 years of life expectancy, are on\nmaximal heart failure medication and after implantation of\nAICD/CRT devices as indicated. Since the outcomes of\ndestination therapy patients have improved markedly, there\nis already a clear trend for a shift to implant patients with\na lesser grade of heart failure for lifetime support [13]. The\n\u201cless sick\u201d patients are considered to be advanced heart\nfailure patients who are non-inotrope dependent and ambu\ufffelatory, qualifying for INTERMACS levels 4\u20137. The natural\ncourse of such patients, if treated medically and with resyn\ufffechronisation devices, is associated with a survival at 1 and\n2 years of ca. 80% and 75%, respectively [21, 22]. Destin\ufffeation therapy in these patients must at least reach results\nequal or superior to the outcome of conservative manage\ufffement. A retrospective, single-centre study, compared pa\ufffetients in INTERMACS levels 4\u20136 receiving VAD therapy\nwith their predicted survival without VAD, according to\nthe Seattle Heart Failure Model [23]. The survival at one\nand two years following VAD implantation reached 85%\nand 80%, respectively, which was superior to the Seattle\nHeart Failure Model predicted survival, with an absolute\nReview article: Current opinion Swiss Med Wkly. 2013;143:w13729\nSwiss Medical Weekly \u00b7 PDF of the online version \u00b7 www.smw.ch Page 5 of 13",

All rights reserved. www.annalscts.com Ann Cardiothorac Surg 2018;7(1):143-151\navailable literature on the outcomes of ACHD undergoing \ncardiac transplantation (48). Mortality was assessed at four \ndifferent time points: 30-day (operative), 1-, 5-, and 10-year. \nThe survival outcomes in ACHD were compared to a \nnon-CHD cohort of adult patients undergoing heart \ntransplantation. There was a statistically significant \ndifference in survival post-transplant. The 30-day mortality \nwas 17.4% in ACHD patients versus 7.4% in non-CHD \nadult patients undergoing cardiac transplantation. The only \nother statistically significant survival difference between \nACHD and non-CHD adult heart transplant patients was at \n10-year. The mortality was 40.7% for ACHD patients versus \n49.0% for non-CHD adult patients (48) (Figure 3). Within \nthe ACHD patients undergoing cardiac transplantation, \nwhere does the risk lie?\nRisk factors for poor outcome post-transplant in \nACHD patients\nSeveral single institution and registry reports have \nindicated worse post-transplant survival in UCHD patients, \nparticularly Fontan patients. The operative mortality \nin these reports varied between 14% to as high as 39% \n(3,5,49,50). In later eras, the mortality appeared to be \nmore equivalent between adult patients undergoing cardiac \ntransplantation after the Fontan procedure and non-CHD \npatients undergoing cardiac transplantation (51). The \nreported outcomes have been mixed in single institution \nseries. The impact of UCHD was assessed in the meta\ufffeanalysis by Doumouras and colleagues. The operative \nmortality in UCHD patients palliated with either a Glenn \nshunt or total cavopulmonary connection (44%) was \nstatistically higher than for non-CHD adult patients (14%) \nundergoing heart transplantation (48). UCHD patients \ncan include those who have gone through staged palliation \nor those that remain unpalliated. UCHD patients who \ndid not have a Glenn or Fontan in the Doumouras study \nhad equivalent survival to adult patients undergoing heart \ntransplant without congenital heart disease. This was a \nnovel finding from other reports assessing the impact of \nUCHD on post-transplant outcome. It suggests that the \nearly mortality after cardiac transplantation for ACHD \npatients is potentially attributable to palliated UCHD. This \nis likely related to the complexity of the reconstruction at \nthe time of implant, the high incidence of right ventricular \ndysfunction of the graft due to persistent elevation of the \nPVR, and low SVR state from profound vasoplegia. \nThe Doumouras meta-analysis was limited by the \ninability to separate out survival outcomes based on \nGlenn palliation or total cavopulmonary connection since \nthe palliated UCHD patients were analyzed as a group. \nThat analysis was also flawed by the lack of distinction \nbetween UCHD patients with impaired or preserved \nventricular function. It has been shown that post-Fontan \npatients with preserved systolic ventricular function have \nworse post-transplant outcomes (4,31). This finding is \nrelated to high incidence of PLE potentially as a result \nof chronic ventricular volume overload from aorto\ufffepulmonary collaterals (52,53). Many of these patients also \nhave diastolic dysfunction, and the transplanted heart must \ntackle the long-term ramifications of diastolic dysfunction \n(i.e., PVR, venous congestion). Another limitation of the \nDoumouras meta-analysis is that it did not assess post\ufffetransplant survival based on immunosuppression strategy. \nKaramlou and colleagues conducted an extensive review of \ncardiac transplantation in ACHD patients using the UNOS \ndatabase from 1990 to 2008 (14). The use of any induction \ntherapy (P=0.008) and steroid maintenance therapy were \nassociated with improved survival in all heart recipients. \nACHD patients, in particular, gained a survival benefit with",
