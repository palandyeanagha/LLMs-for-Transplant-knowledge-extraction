        "text": "\u201csevere\u201d if any organ is scored 3, and \u201cmoderate\u201d for all\nother combinations. Lungs provide the single exception to\nthis rule, where a lung score of 1 results in a global score of\n\u201cmoderate\u201d, and a lung score of 2 results in an overall\n\u201csevere\u201d score because of the potential irreversibility of\npulmonary lesions and the poor prognosis for patients so\naffected [23, 24].\nIn 2014, a second NIH consensus conference revisited\nand updated these criteria based on the evidence generated\nduring the intervening decade [18]. One major recom\ufffemendation was to eliminate from the severity score any\ndysfunction unequivocally caused by an alternative\netiology. Several further refinements to single organ sta\ufffeging were also recommended. In the opinion of this task\nforce, the NIH 2014 criteria are the most accurate and\nwidely accepted standard for the diagnosis and scoring of\ncGvHD.\nIssue 2: Application to clinical practice\nBecause the above-mentioned guidelines were developed\nfor research purposes, their application to \u201creal-life\u201d sce\ufffenarios can be quite challenging for healthcare professionals.\nThis section offers guidance for the application of these\ninternational standards in clinical practice.\nAssessment of the global severity of GvHD\nThe patient\u2019s global severity assessment (overall grade)\nevaluates exclusively three organs for aGvHD (skin, liver,\nand GI tract) and eight organs for cGvHD (skin, mouth,\neyes, GI tract, liver, lungs, muscles/joints/fascia and geni\ufffetals), based on the highest score of organ involvement\nas described above (Tables 2 and 3). No other abnormalities\nhave an impact on the global severity scoring. The patient\u2019s\nfunctional status is documented by Karnofsky\u2212Lansky\nscores, but it does not contribute to the overall score of\neither acute [14\u201316, 19] or chronic GvHD [17, 18]. Simi\ufffelarly, \u201cundefined other\u201d cGvHD manifestations or the\n\u201copinion of the evaluator\u201d should be recorded but should\nnot have an impact on the final global score [18].\nMultiple causes of organ impairment\nFor both acute and chronic GvHD, a given organ is not\nconsidered in the overall GvHD grade if the manifestation is\nsolely due to a non-GvHD cause (e.g. zoster skin infection,\nTable 3 Comparison of the different guidelines available for chronic GvHD assessment: overall severity staging\nOriginal Seattle criteria [21] Revised Seattle criteria [22] NIH criteria (2005 [17] and 2014\n[18])\nDiagnosis\nNA NA Based on either the presence of\nspecific diagnostic signs or\ndistinctive signs accompanied by\nadditional confirmation (e.g. biopsy\nor other objective diagnostic test) in\nat least one target organ (skin &\nappendages, mouth, eyes, genitalia,\nesophagus, lungs and muscles &\nfascia)\nSeverity Scoring\nLimited\nLimited skin AND/OR limited hepatic\ninvolvement\nLimited skin AND/OR limited hepatic\ninvolvement OR single organ sicca syndrome\n(eyes, mouth, vagina)\nMild No more than two organs\nwith a scorea of 1, except\nfor lung\nExtensive\nGeneralized skin involvement AND/OR major\nhepatic complications AND/OR an isolated\nsicca syndrome of the eyes, mouth AND/OR\nany other organ involvement\nGeneralized skin involvement AND/OR major\nhepatic complications AND/OR multiple\norgans involved (more than two, including\n\u201cnails\u201d), the presence of skin sclerosis/serositis\nor fasciitis, bronchiolitis obliterans, decreased\nperformance status (<60% Karnofsky\u2212Lansky\nindex) or weight loss >15%\nModerate Any other severity\nscoringa not included in\nthe mild or severe\ncategories\nSevere At least one organ with a\nscorea of 3 or a lung\nscorea of 2\nGvHD graft versus host disease, NA not applicable, NIH National Institutes of Health\na Based on specific severity criteria described individually for the manifestations of chronic GvHD in eight target organs (skin & appendages,\nmouth, eyes, genitalia, GI tract, liver, lungs and muscles & fascia) and measured on a range of 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) for each organ [18]\n1406 H.

Accordingly, the confirmation of\nAATD should be followed by evaluating the specific\nclinical presentation in order to identify symptoms\nintensity and prognostic markers [48, 49].\nMultidimensional tools and scales for determining AATD\nhave been explored. The BODE (body mass index, airflow\nobstruction, dyspnoea, and exercise capacity) index was\nrecently validated in a cohort of 191 AATD patients under\ufffegoing lung transplantation who were followed from 2006 to\n2012. The authors found that the BODE index could better\ndiscriminate survival than both forced expiratory volume in\none second (FEV1) alone and the 2011 Global Initiative for\nChronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) classification.\nHowever, future trials will be required to elucidate the use\ufffefulness of the BODE index, or any other multidimensional\nscales, for treatment selection [50].\nAdditionally, different health status questionnaires and\nseverity scores are available, including the St George\u2019s\nRespiratory Questionnaire, the COPD severity score, the\nEuroQoL 5-Dimensions, the Living with COPD, and the\nCOPD Assessment Test. Recently, an observational,\ncross-sectional study including 96 COPD patients (includ\ufffeing 35 cases of AATD-related COPD) evaluated some of\nthese questionnaires. Patients with AATD COPD showed a\nsimilar degree of health status impairment as those with\nnon-AATD COPD. Additionally, there were stronger corre\ufffelations between AATD COPD health status measurements\nand lung function impairment than for non-AATD COPD.\nTherefore, evidence regarding the performance of different\nquestionnaires for more comprehensive evaluation of\nAATD patients is starting to accumulate [51].\nPrognosis\nThe natural history and prognosis of AATD is variable.\nMost people with a severe deficiency have a lower life\nexpectancy relative to the general population [52, 53],\nwith the exception of never-smokers that were identified\nthrough family or population screening [54].

From there, \nit should be possible to direct the appropriate care for \nthe this population. \nWithin this context, the present study was developed \nby means of a systematic review of literature, with \nthe objective of investigating changes in pulmonary \ncapacities and volumes associated with obesity.\nMETHODS\nIdentification of the studies\nTo identify the articles available in the literature on \nthe theme under study, the MEDLINE and LILACS \ndatabases were used and accessed through PubMed \n(http://www.pubmed.gov) and SciELO (http://www.\nscielo.br).\nThe following keywords were used in the search: \nin English, \u201cobesity and lungfunction\u201d, \u201cobese and \nlung function\u201d, and, in Portuguese, \u201cobesidade e fun\u00e7\u00e3o \npulmonar\u201d. \u201cLung function\u201d is not a keyword indexed \nin Mesh or Decs, but given the importance of this \nterm for the search, it was adopted as a keyword. \nThe investigation was limited to the presence of the \nkeywords in the title and/or abstracts of the articles. \nSelection of the studies\nThe studies that evaluated lung function of obese \nor overweight individuals by means of spirometry or \nplethysmography tests were selected. Obese individuals \nwere considered as those with a body mass index \n(BMI) >30kg/m\u00b2 and overweight people as those with \nBMI \u226525kg/m\u00b2.(7) As variables for the lung function \nevaluations, we searched for lung volumes and \ncapacities: total lung capacity (TLC), vital capacity \n(VC), forced vital capacity (FVC), residual functional \ncapacity (RFC), forced expiratory volume after 1 second \n(FEV1\n), inspiratory reserve volume (IRV), tidal volume \n(TV), expiratory reserve volume (ERV), and residual \nvolume (RV).\nAfter identification of the keywords in the title and/\nor abstract, the selected articles went through reading of \nthe abstracts to evaluate how appropriate the methods \nand study populations were as to the proposal of this \nreview. Those tests that satisfied the predetermined \neligibility criteria were acquired in their entirety for \ndetailed analysis and data extraction.\nThe articles describing studies in children, which did \nnot use spirometry or plethysmography to evaluate lung \nvolumes, or that evaluated lung function of individuals \nwith chronic lung disease, and review articles were \nexcluded. \nData extraction\nThe search and analysis of articles, as per the strategy \nmentioned above, were conducted independently by two \nevaluators (Author 1 and Author 2). Controversies as to \neligibility of the publications to compose the database \nwere resolved by consensus.\nThere was no blinding as to names of the authors, \njournals, or organizations. This is a possible source \nof bias, even if involuntary. On the other hand, as a \nstrategy to minimize biases, each author involved in the \nselection of articles only acknowledged articles selected \nby the other author at the time of consensus for choosing \nappropriate studies for data extraction. Additionally, \nsince the search was limited to the keywords chosen, \nit is possible that other studies on the theme were not \ntaken into consideration.\nData tabulation \nThe texts selected were read in detail to compile data",

This statistical model, in\nwhich lung volume attained during scan acquisition was\nlog-transformed before it was used as a covariate, was\napplied to the analyses for all of the different densitomet\uffferic indices. In contrast to the case when PD15 is used as\nthe densitometric index, where log-transformed TLV is\nroutinely used as a covariate in the statistical model, the\noptimum lung volume adjustment method for the voxel\nindex parameters has not been established. Consequently,\nin the absence of any alternative, the same volume adjust\ufffement method was used for the voxel index as for PD15 in\nthis study.\nSensitivity ratios were determined for each of the densito\ufffemetric indices by dividing the value for the mean change\nfrom baseline in lung density by the standard error to\nobtain a sensitivity index. Sensitivity ratios measured by\nPD15 were also determined for the 3 lung regions. These\ndata were obtained from analysis of the placebo group\nonly. In order to establish the influence of inspiratory\nlevel on the different densitometric indices, additional\nsensitivity measurements were carried out in a post-hoc\nanalysis without the lung volume adjustment.\nResults\nPatient characteristics at baseline\nIn total, of the 82 patients enrolled into the study from the\n3 centres, 77 patients were randomised to Prolastin (n =\n38) or placebo (n = 39), and 71 patients (n = 36, Prolastin;\nn = 35, placebo) were included in the mITT population.\nThe number of patients in the ITT population who com\ufffepleted the study was 67, and 10 patients (3 in the Prolas\ufffetin group and 7 in the placebo group) discontinued\nprematurely, resulting in a median of 127 weeks of expo\ufffesure to Prolastin and 108 weeks to placebo. The study was\ncompleted by 92% of patients in the Prolastin group and\n82% of patients in the placebo group (ITT population), as\ndescribed previously [13].\nDemographics and disease severity at baseline for all ran\ufffedomised patients are summarised in Table 1. Complete\ndescriptive details have been previously reported [13]. CT\ndata indicate that the majority of patients had predomi\ufffenantly basal emphysema and that there were no signifi\ufffecant differences in lung density between the Prolastin and\nplacebo groups at baseline (Table 1).\nCT densitometric progression\nAll CT scan data were reviewed prior to study analysis in a\nblinded fashion to identify densitometric values that\nmight be invalid because of technical issues, as previously\ndescribed [13]. A total of 15 scans were invalid, which\nresulted in 6 patients having only 1 CT scan; these patients\nwere therefore excluded from the mITT population.\nComparison of densitometric indices\nThe mean decline in lung density was determined and\nadjusted for lung volume, as described above (see Meth\ufffeods). All CT densitometric indices demonstrated a signifi\ufffecant decline in both the Prolastin and placebo groups over\nthe course of the study, consistent with emphysema pro\ufffegression (Table 2). The changes in PD15 from baseline to\nlast CT scan were -2.645 g/L (Prolastin group) and -4.117\ng/L (placebo group), indicating a significant treatment\neffect (p = 0.049) (Table 2).

Studying over 10 000\npeople from HUNT2, we recently found dyspnoea to be inde\ufffependently associated with mortality within four levels of pre\ufffebronchodilator ppFEV1.\n15 In order to add possible predictive\nvalue of symptom burden without losing predictive value from\nlung function, we suggest keeping all four spirometric GOLD\ngrades in the combined COPD assessment in the next revision\nof the GOLD strategy document.\nIn contrast to the current study, Lange et al5 found poorer sur\ufffevival in group B compared to group C in people with pre\ufffebronchodilator COPD from the general population of Denmark,\nand they suggested CVD or cancer as possible explanations. Since\nmost analyses were unadjusted, their results may have been\nbiased by confounding factors. In addition, the average follow-up\nwas 4.3 years, and it is possible that the associations will change\nwith longer follow-up. In a pooled analysis of 11 COPD cohorts,\nSoriano et al6 found no difference between post-bronchodilator\nspirometric GOLD grades and ABCD groups in predicting mor\ufffetality during almost 16 000 person-years. Neither Lange et al5\nnor Soriano et al6 performed sex specific analyses. In the current\nstudy, group B consisted of 21% of the women and 16% of the\nmen, while group C consisted of 9% of the women and 14% of\nthe men.
