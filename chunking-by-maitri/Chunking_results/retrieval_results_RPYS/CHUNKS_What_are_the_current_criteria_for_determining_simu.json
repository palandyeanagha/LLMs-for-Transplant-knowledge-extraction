        "text": "for SLK transplant and the concept of a safety net for liver\nrecipients who develop ESRD shortly after LTA.\nMedical eligibility criteria for SLK transplantation includes\npatients with CKD, sustained AKI and metabolic disease. CKD\nwas defined as estimated GFR of <60 mL/min for >90 days\nprior to listing and an estimated GFR of <35 mL/min at the\ntime of listing or ESRD on maintenance dialysis. The rationale\nfor suggesting a higher GFR cut-off for SLK listing is based on\nthe data showing a 30% frequency of ESRD over 3 years in\npatients who had an GFR <30 mL/min at the time of liver\ntransplantation.20 Moreover, the addition of calcineurin inhib\ufffeitor to the immunosuppressive regimen in patients with low\nGFR results in a further reduction in GFR, by at least 10 mL/min,\nsoon after transplantation, bringing the GFR closer to the GFR\nrequirement for KTA listing.27,28 Sustained AKI was defined as\nthe requirement for acute dialysis for 6 weeks or longer, an\nestimated GFR <25 mL/min for 6 weeks or more or a combina\ufffetion of dialysis and estimated GFR <25 mL/min for 6 consec\ufffeutive weeks duration.\nThe concept of a safety net is an essential component of the\nproposed policy. This stems from the evidence that survival of\nLTA recipients on the kidney wait-list is inferior to those listed\nfor first KTA. However, those prior LTA recipients who developed\nkidney failure and received a kidney transplant within 3 years of\nthe liver transplant had long-term survival that was similar to\nKTA recipients. It was proposed that any LTA recipient who is\nregistered for the kidney wait-list between 60 to 365 days\npostliver transplant with either ESRD or GFR #20 mL/min\nshould be prioritized. It will not be applicable to SLK recipients,\nunless they meet the definition of primary kidney nonfunction\n(defined as being on dialysis or estimated GFR #20 mL/min)\n90 days after SLK transplantation. The current UNOS criteria for\nsimultaneous liver kidney transplantation including \u201csafety net\u201d\nare shown in Table 2. This policy went into effect as of August\n10, 2017.29\nAnother feature added to the policy was inclusion of regional\nsharing of kidneys in SLK transplant for patients with MELD\nscores $35. Prior to implementation of this SLK policy, patients\nrequiring SLK transplant are likely to have MELD scores $35\nand are eligible for regional sharing for liver but not for kidney\nunder the new kidney allocation policy. Thus, physicians were\nforced to make a choice of either waiting for SLK when offered\nlocally or to simply accept liver-alone through regional sharing\nfor patients with high MELD score.\nPredicted outcomes from the proposed and recently\nimplemented SLK policy\nThe policy proposed for SLK by Formica et al.30 is a first step\ntowards optimizing the use of a scarce resource. The intent of\nthe policy is to standardize the allocation of kidney allograft in\nliver transplant recipients based on medical eligibility. Adop\ufffetion of new criteria can reduce variability in center-wise prac\ufffetice patterns, better benchmarking of practice and further\nrefinement of SLK allocation recommendations.30\nThe key feature of this policy of requiring a safety net will\nallow patients who suffer from ESRD soon after liver trans\ufffeplantation timely access to kidney transplantation. It is hoped\nthat this will decrease the physician\u2019s rushed and erratic\nconclusion to add kidney allograft in prospective liver trans\ufffeplant recipients with potentially reversible renal dysfunction\nand relieve the clinicians of the burden of a wrong decision.\nAlmost 15\u201320% of LTA candidates have an estimated\nGFR <30 mL/min and another 20\u201330% have an estimated\nGFR <60 mL/min at the time of liver transplant evaluation.6,22\nThe risk of ESRD at 1 year from LTA is minimal, even in\nTable 1.

There is possi\ufffebility of abuse with these criteria for listing of SLK if there is one\ntime documentation of GFR <35 mL/min. There is also concern\nthat this policy might in fact further increase the rate of SLK\ntransplantation.33 It is also possible that the new criteria could\npotentially decrease the number of SLK transplants performed,\nsince 19% all SLK transplants performed between 2014 and\n2015 did not meet current proposed criteria.\nProven factors for CKD, such as the presence of long standing\npretransplant diabetes or proteinuria, were not incorporated in\nthe proposed policy.34 More controversial and liberal is the AKI\ndefinition in the policy.30 These patients comprise about 40% of\nall SLK transplantations. Less than 10% of patients with LTA are\non dialysis in the first year of transplantation, indicating that\nmany recover native renal function.22 Asch et al.30 also propose\nthe concept of futility to be added to the policy, where organs are\nnot being offered to patients with poor projected survival.30\nThe proposed policy of SLK is based on the tenet of urgency,\nwhich contradicts the new kidney allocation system based on\nthe tenet of utility. SLK transplantation exemplifies the tradeoff\nbetween the principle of utility and medical urgency, as shown\nby a recent Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data\ufffebase analysis that compared kidney allograft life span in SLK\nrecipients to donor-matched kidneys transplanted as KTA or\nsimultaneous pancreas kidney transplantation. The adjusted\n10-year mean kidney allograft life span was higher in KTA and\nsimultaneous pancreas kidney recipients compared with SLK\nrecipients by 0.99 years in the MELD era and 1.71 years in the\npreMELD era. In other words, about 1 year of renal allograft life\nspan is traded with SLK transplantation, so that a sicker patient\ngains access to organs.35\nThe proposed policy for SLK transplantation does not\naddress the current multiorgan transplantation policy, which\nconflicts with the OPTN\u2019s \u201cfinal rule\u201d based on sound medical\njudgment to ensure equity and efficacy in organ allocation.\nThe current multiorgan transplant policy provides kidney\nallocation with another organ, regardless of the degree and\nduration of renal dysfunction, potential of kidney function\nrecovery and the survival benefit of the addition of kidney.34\nA recent study by Ekser et al.,\n36 described a novel idea of\ndelaying the kidney allograft for >48 h in patients undergoing\ncombined liver kidney transplantation.36 Liver transplantation\nis first performed while the kidney allograft is placed on the\nhypothermic pulsatile machine in order to allow time to stabi\ufffelize the patient\u2019s hemodynamics and normalize coagulopathy\nbefore implantation of the kidney allograft, thus reducing the\nrisk for delayed graft function development and optimizing the\nrenal allograft function. This approach was associated with\nsuperior graft and patient survival rates during the 4 year\nfollow-up. This could also avoid the wastage of kidney allograft\nin high-risk liver transplant patients.\nFinally, the interesting question as to whether liver is\nimmune-protective to the kidney in the setting of SLK trans\ufffeplantation has been asked. A recent study looked at the\nincidence of kidney allograft rejection between SLK (n = 68)\nand KTA (n = 136) recipients, utilizing protocol renal transplant\nbiopsies.37 Pretransplant donor-specific antibodies were\npresent in 20.5% of the patients in both groups. Among patients\nwith donor-specific antibodies, there was higher incidence of\nantibody-mediated rejection (46.4% vs. 7.1%) and transplant\nglomerulopathy (53.6% vs. 0%) in KTA versus SLK recipients.\nTable 2.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) can\ndevelop in up to 23% of patients with cirrhosis, while chronic\nkidney disease (CKD) is present in 1% of such patients.1,2\nSince introduction of the model for end-stage liver disease\n(MELD) scoring system for organ allocation in liver transplant\ncandidates in 2002, the incidence of renal dysfunction among\nliver transplant recipients has been significantly increasing,\ncontributing to an increasing trend in simultaneous liver\ufffekidney transplantation (SLK) after 2002.3\u20135\nAKI affects 25% to 50% of liver transplant recipients, while\nCKD develops in 30% to 90% and risk of end-stage renal\ndisease (ESRD) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) is in\nthe range of 2% to 5% per year after transplantation.6 Native\nkidney function recovery following liver transplantation alone\n(LTA) is difficult to predict, and indications for SLK transplanta\ufffetion are not precisely defined. The decision to transplant SLK\nhas largely been center-specific and driven by the fear of per\ufffesistent renal failure after LTA and its associated poor outcomes.\nA recent study identified early liver allograft dysfunction, early\ndevelopment of stage 3 AKI following LTA and requirement for\nRRT at the time of liver transplantation as independent risk\nfactors for the development of ESRD within first year of LTA.7\nPredictors of renal function recovery with good discrimina\ufffetion following LTA are poorly defined. Patients wait-listed for\nkidney transplantation after nonrenal organ transplantation\nhave worse outcomes compared to patients waiting for kidney\ntransplant alone (KTA).8 Currently, the outcomes of SLK trans\ufffeplants are excluded from Scientific Registry of Transplant\nRecipients, further encouraging the transplant centers to add\nkidney to a high-risk liver candidate in order to buffer their\nprogram\u2019s outcome.4 Lack of uniform criteria for allocating\nkidney to SLK has led to marked variation in the rates of SLK\ntransplantation among transplant centers, ranging from 0% to\n44% of all liver transplants performed.9 With the increasing\ntrend in the number of SLK transplants has come controversy",

This study is designed to compare ioRRT during LT with \nstandard supportive therapy in patients with a glomerular filtra\ufffetion rate (GFR) of less than 60 ml/min. The results are prelimi\ufffenary and the study population is limited to non-pre-transplant \nCRRT patients receiving LT alone; nevertheless, the study may \nbecome a cornerstone for ioRRT research and may affect the fu\ufffeture management of high-MELD score recipients in the future.\nSimultaneous liver and kidney transplantation\nAs a last step in this study, we searched literature databases \nfor SLKT listing criteria. We realized that almost all of the SLKT \nrecipients in Korea, including the patients from our cases, \nshowed lower MELD scores as compared with recipients in \nthe US. In living donor SLKT, the availability of simultaneous \ndonors exerts more leverage on the decision of SLKT than the \nnature of the disease itself. However, even in the deceased do\ufffenor case (case B), kidney function was enough to filtrate body \nwastes without RRT (SCr 1.58 mg/dl). This may be attributed \nto the current non-existence of SLKT listing criteria in Korea. \nIn the US, there are a few consensus guidelines on SLKT listing \ncriteria, which have been largely made and revised using Organ \nProcurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) data. How\ufffeever, they are, by all means, not perfect and there are still many \nobstacles to be solved. \nFirst, currently there is no consensus on the definitions of \nAKI and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the setting of LT. It is \nwell known that SCr, the classic biomarker, can lead to overes\ufffetimation of the true kidney function in end-stage liver disease \nrecipients. However, the feasibility and widespread laboratory \navailability of SCr has made it to form the basis for estimating \nthe degree of renal dysfunction, even in LT and SLKT. For now, \nthe most notable definition of renal dysfunction is the Risk, \nInjury, Failure, Loss, End-stage kidney disease (RIFLE) 5 stage \ncriteria developed in 2004, which was modified to a three-stage \nsystem by the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) in 2007. \nKidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) in 2012 \nadded a last touch to the RIFLE criteria by formulating albu\ufffeminuria criteria and applying a time frame to the SCr criteria. \nFurthermore, to define renal dysfunction in LT recipients, a \nworking party by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) \nand International Ascites Club in 2011 suggested a proposal to \napply the RIFLE criteria to define AKI and CKD in patients with \ncirrhosis, irrespective of the cause [11]. New candidates for bio\ufffemarkers, such as cystatin C and neutrophil gelatinase-associated \nlipocalin (NGAL), are currently under investigation. A new def\ufffeinition of renal dysfunction made up by those novel biomarkers \nis needed to create an appropriate SLKT listing criteria.\nSecond, key factors that determine non-recovery of kidney \nfunction after LT remain poorly defined. Recently, Sharma et al. \n[12] reported a retrospective review analyzing 2,112 adult de\ufffeceased donor LT recipients who received acute RRT for less than \n90 days before LT. The authors concluded that native renal func\ufffetion was recovered in the majority of patients within six months \npost-transplant, with the cumulative risk of renal non-recovery \nbeing 8.9%. According to the study by Sharma et al., risk factors \nof renal non-recovery were age at LT, longer duration of RRT, re\ufffetransplant and pre-LT diabetes. Although it is a good option for \na patient who has both end-stage liver and kidney disease, SLKT \nshould not be performed in patients in whom renal dysfunction \nis expected to disappear after LT. According to literatures, in \nthe past decade in the US, more than 30,000 adults were added \nto the KT waiting list annually, but only 55\u201360% eventually re\ufffeceived a deceased kidney graft. During that same time period,",

        "text": "Minjae Kim, et al. Simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation 457\nalso underwent KT (DDKT in 11 and LDKT in 23). Thus, \nsequential LT-KT was performed in 34 patients. Current\ufffely, 51 patients are in the waiting list of DDKT. Eleven \nof them were enrolled before LT and 40 patients were en\ufffelisted after LT.\nDISCUSSION\nA considerable proportion of patients with both end\ufffestage liver and kidney diseases have undergone LT alone \nor SLKT worldwide. Recently, the proportion of SLKT \namong all LTs in the United States increased up to 9.9% \nin 2016.3,4 Meanwhile, because of profound deceased do\ufffenor shortage in Korea, around 1% of LT candidates had \nundergone deceased donor SLKT in the current analysis \nof the KONOS database. In our institution, only 0.2% of \ntotal LT cases underwent SLKT with deceased or living \ndonors. To the best of our knowledge, our Case No. 1 \nwas the first case of SLKT in Korea. Considering that KT \nwas performed in 3 patients before LT and 34 patients \nafter LT, the sum of combined LT and KT was 48, ac\ufffecounting for 0.7% of total LT cases. In addition, 51 pa\ufffetients are currently enrolled in the waiting list of DDKT. \nConsidering that there are many other patients showing \nslow but progressive deterioration of renal function after \nLT, the demand for KT in LT recipients would be higher \nthan we calculated.\nInformation on SLKT in Korea is very limited. There \nare only a few case reports of SLKT from Korean trans\ufffeplant centers in the literature.5-8 A Korean single-center \nreport on 3000 cases of KT has presented the performance \nof 16 cases of SLKT,9\n however, detailed information on \nSLKT was not described. This was the primary reason \nthat we carried out this study.\nRenal disease has high impacts on LT candidates. \nSerum creatinine is included in the MELD scoring system \nbecause renal impairment is associated with a substantial \nincrease in 30\u2010day mortality, especially if an LT candidate \nrequires dialysis.1,3 Renal impairment is a common occur\uffference in patients with liver disease. Some studies in\ufffedicated that its prevalence is 15%-20% in LT candidates.10\nThe requirement to update MELD scores after the initial \nlisting allows for allocation of a liver to those most in \nneed.\nRenal disease on LT recipients also has a high prog\ufffenostic impact. The impact of kidney disease on LT candi\ufffedates is not limited to pretransplant mortality. LT recipi\ufffeents who develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) following \nLT show significant increases of liver allograft failure and \nmortality compared to those who do not develop CKD af\ufffeter LT. Significant renal disease prior to LT is the most \nimportant risk factor for CKD after LT. Determining the \ncause of acute kidney injury in LT candidates can be chal\ufffelenging, which complicates the ability to assess potential \nrenal recovery after LT. LT candidates on dialysis for \nmore than 90 days with advanced CKD and prolonged \nacute kidney injury not from hepatorenal syndrome have \na higher risk for significant renal impairment after LT.11\nAfter the introduction of MELD criteria for allocation \nof LT in the United States, there was a more than 400% \nincrease in SLKT, from 2.5% in 2001 to 9.9% in 2016. \nThis change was driven primarily by poor outcomes of \nLT recipients with posttransplant kidney disease, an in\ufffeability to predict which candidates were likely to develop \npost\u2010LT CKD, and the lack of a mechanism to expedite \nKT in LT recipients who developed advanced CKD after \nLT.11 The introduction of MELD score to the KONOS liv\ufffeer allocation system and an increase in the number of de\ufffeceased donors raised the proportion of deceased donor \nSLKT from 0.6% before the adoption of MELD score to \n1.2% after the adoption of MELD score in the present \nstudy.12-14 Although this increase was statistically sig\ufffenificant, the proportion of SLKT was still very low com\ufffepared to that in the United States.11,15\nAn analysis of United Network for Organ Sharing \n(UNOS)/Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network",
