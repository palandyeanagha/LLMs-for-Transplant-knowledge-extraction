However, antibody-mediated rejection remains an unsolved problem because of its refractoriness \nto standard immunosuppressive therapy with high mortality and graft loss. We experienced a 16-year old patient with \nhemodynamic compromise caused by both cellular and antibody-mediated rejection 12 years after HTx. The rejection \nwas refractory to repeated steroid pulse treatment, intravenous immunoglobulin administration, and intensifying immu\ufffenosuppression including addition of everolimus. Eventually, she was successfully treated with repeated plasma exchange \naccompanied by a single administration of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab. (Int Heart J 2013; 54: 328-\n331)\nKey words: Rituximab, Plasma exchange, Teenager, Adherence\nRecent advances in immunosuppressive therapy have \ngreatly improved the outcome of heart transplantation \n(HTx) in stage D heart failure (HF) patients. Cellular \nrejection (CR), which is mainly mediated by T-cells, accounts \nfor the majority of allograft rejection episodes after HTx.1) CR \nhas become controlled to a considerable extent by current im\ufffemunosuppressive regimens that are designed to target T-cell \nimmune function. On the other hand, antibody-mediated rejec\ufffetion (AMR) after HTx has long been an unsolved problem be\ufffecause few schemes for the treatment of B cell-driven AMR \nhave been established.2) Circulating antibodies mediate rejec\ufffetion through complement activation and fixation on graft en\ufffedothelium, thereby contributing to both early and late graft \nloss, cardiac allograft vasculopathy, and higher mortality.3,4)\nRecently, rituximab, a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal anti\ufffebody that binds to the antigen expressed on B-cells, has been \neffective for AMR in several case reports though it is still off\ufffelabel.5-7) AMR usually occurs early after HTx, and reports of it \noccurring a long time after HTx are rare. We experienced a pa\ufffetient with acute decompensated HF caused by CR and AMR \nsimultaneously 12 years after HTx, which might be attributable \nto poor adherence to medication. The rejection was successful\ufffely treated by plasma exchange (PE) and a single administration \nof rituximab.\nCase Report\nIn August 2000, a 4-year old Japanese female with dilated \ncardiomyopathy underwent HTx in the United States. Her \npostoperative course was uneventful, and she was followed at \nother hospitals near Tokyo. Her last endomyocardial biopsy in \n2010 showed no rejection and echocardiography revealed pre\ufffeserved ejection fraction.\nIn July 2012, 12 years after the HTx, she presented with \nacute decompensated HF with New York Heart Association \nclass IV symptoms accompanied by orthopnea, and she was \nreferred to our hospital for the first time. We started treatment \nof the acute HF as shown in Figure 1. Maintenance immuno\ufffesuppressive therapy before admission included 6.5 mg/day of \ntacrolimus and 10 mg/day of azathioprine. The low trough lev\ufffeel of tacrolimus (2.9 \u03bcg/L) on admission suggested her poor \nadherence to recent medication. Her height was 150 cm and \nbody mass index was 24.8.

        "text": "protocols for the treatment of chronic rejection would have\na major impact on standard clinical care in organ trans\ufffeplantation and would probably improve graft survival in a\nconsiderable proportion of transplant recipients. However,\nup to now, no systematic trial to prove clinical efficiency of\ntargeted anti-humoral therapy has been reported.\nIn the last years, uncontrolled studies have suggested a\nbeneficial effect of distinct treatment approaches on the\ncourse of late AMR. Very recently, Billing and colleagues\nreported on a cohort of 20 pediatric kidney transplant\nrecipients who were diagnosed as having C4d-positive\nchronic AMR [22]. In support of smaller previous series\n[20,21], combined treatment with high-dose IVIG and\nCD20 antibody rituximab stabilized kidney function and\nled to a decrease in DSA levels at least in some of the\ntreated patients. Even though a few recipients lost their\ngraft during follow-up, longitudinal analysis of kidney\nfunction showed an amelioration of the decline in GFR,\nparticularly in patients with a lesser degree of chronic\ninjury. Major caveats of this and of other studies, how\ufffeever, are an uncontrolled design and the lack of a non\ufffetreated control group, respectively [22].\nWhile IVIG and rituximab as well as other treatments\nmay not target long-lived antibody-producing plasma\ncells [24], the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib was\nshown to directly affect the function and integrity of\nnonmalignant plasma cells [25-27], and may therefore\nbe a promising approach to halt the progression of\nantibody-mediated graft damage. This agent was shown\nto directly block HLA antibody production in the con\ufffetext of acute AMR [27], and numerous case reports and\nuncontrolled studies have pointed to efficiency of this\napproach in the treatment of acute rejection [28-30].\nSuch promising preliminary data and a recently pub\ufffelished case of chronic AMR showing partial responses to\nbortezomib treatment, including DSA reduction and loss\nof C4d staining along transplant capillaries [32], have\nnow prompted us to plan a systematic trial designed to\nanalyze the concept of proteasome inhibition.\nApplying a randomized placebo-controlled double\ufffeblind design, our single-center trial has the potential to\ndefinitely clarify the impact of bortezomib on the course\nof late AMR after kidney transplantation. A major point\nis that the trial is investigator initiated and is therefore\nfree from any commercial bias.\nConsidering earlier reported rates of DSA positivity in\nlong-term transplant recipients [13], the chosen ap\ufffeproach of a cross-sectional screening of a large number\nof patients followed at our outpatient facility can be ex\ufffepected to allow for the recruitment of a sufficient num\ufffeber of patients fulfilling the criteria for randomization in\nthe intervention trial.\nTo avoid imbalances between study groups, randomization\nwill be stratified for kidney function at the time of\nrandomization and the presence or absence of T-cell\ufffemediated rejection in index biopsies. Stratification for\nkidney function (GFR <50 ml/minute/1.73 m2 vs. >50 ml/\nminute/1.73 m2\n) was chosen to account for expected in\ufffeterindividual variability regarding the extent of chronic\ntransplant injury (for example, transplant glomerulopathy,\nchronic vasculopathy or interstitial fibrosis/tubular atro\ufffephy). Indeed, one may argue that an irreversibility of\nchronic injury may critically influence the responsiveness\nto specific treatment. Similarly, intergroup differences\nwith respect to the proportions of study patients with\nacute T-cellular rejection could substantially influence trial\noutcomes.\nWe have chosen the slope of GFR over 24-month\nfollow-up as the primary endpoint. Using kidney func\ufffetion as a surrogate parameter of long-term allograft sur\ufffevival [40], the sample size calculation revealed the need\nfor inclusion of 44 patients to detect clinically relevant\nGFR differences between groups (5 ml/minute/1.73 m2\nper year).

Mixed rejection was seen in a total of 30% of \npatients with moderate to severe ACR by biopsy grading. \nFollow up was too short to ascertain an impact on more \nlong-term outcomes. There is general agreement that AMR \nwith graft dysfunction should be treated and treated AMR is \nassociated with worse outcomes. Controversy exists around \nthe optimal approach to asymptomatic biopsy-detected \nAMR, including whether to treat, frequency of follow up, \nand surveillance. \nLate rejection and rejection with hemodynamic \ncompromise\nRejection beyond 1 year post-transplant, or late rejection, \nhas also decreased over time, though with a persistent \nimpact on CAV and mortality (47). Risk factors include \nearly rejection, anti-HLA antibodies, older age, African\ufffeAmerican race, and non-adherence (39). Observations \nregarding rejection with hemodynamic compromise \nrequiring inotropic support have not revealed the same era \neffect as with the other types of rejection, and worse survival \nof 49% at 5 years persists (39). Hemodynamic supports \nappropriate for the clinical presentation and aggressive \nintensification of immunosuppression is required to manage \nany rejection with hemodynamic compromise.\nCAV\nCAV is a leading cause of death beyond 3 years after \ntransplantation (Figure 14). Risk factors for CAV in children \ninclude older donor age, older recipient age, donor cigarette \nuse, recipient black race, transplant era, no induction \ntherapy, re-transplantation, rejection in the first year post\ufffetransplant and repeated episodes of cellular rejection (2,48). \nFreedom from CAV is 40% by 17 years post-transplant \n(Figure 21) but does vary by age (Figure 22), and is one of \nthe few things that is impacted upon by induction therapy \n(Figure 23).\nDiagnosis is highly dependent on the type and \nfrequency of surveillance post-transplant which is \nhighly variable.

The formation of donor-specific\nantibodies (DSA) and ongoing antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) processes may critically contribute to late graft\nloss. However, appropriate treatment for late AMR has not yet been defined. There is accumulating evidence that\nthe proteasome inhibitor bortezomib may substantially affect the function and integrity of alloantibody-secreting\nplasma cells. The impact of this agent on the course of late AMR has not so far been systematically investigated.\nMethods/design: The BORTEJECT Study is a randomized controlled trial designed to clarify the impact of\nintravenous bortezomib on the course of late AMR. In this single-center study (nephrological outpatient service,\nMedical University Vienna) we plan an initial cross-sectional DSA screening of 1,000 kidney transplant recipients\n(functioning graft at \u2265180 days; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >20 ml/minute/1.73 m2\n). DSA-positive\nrecipients will be subjected to kidney allograft biopsy to detect morphological features consistent with AMR.\nForty-four patients with biopsy-proven AMR will then be included in a double-blind placebo-controlled intervention\ntrial (1:1 randomization stratified for eGFR and the presence of T-cell-mediated rejection). Patients in the active group\nwill receive two cycles of bortezomib (4 \u00d7 1.3 mg/m2 over 2 weeks; 3-month interval between cycles). The primary end\npoint will be the course of eGFR over 24 months (intention-to-treat analysis). The sample size was calculated according\nto the assumption of a 5 ml/minute/1.73 m2 difference in eGFR slope (per year) between the two groups (alpha: 0.05;\npower: 0.8). Secondary endpoints will be DSA levels, protein excretion, measured glomerular filtration rate, transplant\nand patient survival, and the development of acute and chronic morphological lesions in 24-month protocol biopsies.\nDiscussion: The impact of anti-humoral treatment on the course of late AMR has not yet been systematically\ninvestigated. Based on the hypothesis that proteasome inhibition improves the outcome of DSA-positive late\nAMR, we suggest that our trial has the potential to provide solid evidence towards the treatment of this type\nof rejection.\nTrial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01873157.\nKeywords: Antibody-mediated rejection, Donor-specific antibody, Bortezomib, Kidney transplantation,\nProteasome inhibition\n* Correspondence: georg.boehmig@meduniwien.ac.at 1\nDivision of Nephrology and Dialysis, Department of Medicine III, Medical\nUniversity Vienna, W\u00e4hringer G\u00fcrtel 18-20, A-1090 Vienna, Austria\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nTRIALS\n\u00a9 2014 Eskandary et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Anti-C5 mAb also successfully \nreversed established antibody-mediated rejection (73). In light of the \nassociation between anti-HLA antibodies and chronic antibody-medi\ufffeated graft rejection, ongoing studies are testing the efficacy of eculi\ufffezumab in preventing graft loss in kidney transplant recipients with \ndonor-specific antibodies (NCT01327573).\nFrom a diagnostic/biomarker standpoint, investigators hypothe\ufffesized that detection of serum anti-HLA antibodies capable of bind\ufffeing C1q would enhance the prognostic utility of serum alloantibody \nanalysis in kidney transplantation (74, 75). The latest iteration of \nthe single antigen bead technology currently used for detecting \nanti-HLA antibodies (76) additionally identifies those antibodies \nthat bind C1q. A 2013 population-based study of 1,016 kidney \ntransplant recipients suggested that, among patients with anti-HLA \nantibodies, those that were C1q+ had the worst graft survival (77).\nColvin and colleagues pioneered the use of C4d staining in graft \ntissue as a diagnostic test for antibody-mediated allograft rejection \n(AMR) (78). C4d is an activation byproduct of classical pathway \ncomplement activation and its detection in graft tissue is more \nsensitive than detection of immunoglobulin. As a consequence, \nC4d staining has become a valuable tool for diagnosing AMR. \nImportantly, diagnostic sensitivity depends on staining method\ufffeology and cases of C4d\u2013 AMR have been described (79).\nComplement and kidney graft injury and fibrosis\nMechanisms of late graft failure are complex and involve immune \nand non-immune mechanisms (80), but late graft loss routinely \nresults in pathological evidence of progressive glomerulosclerosis, \nFigure 2\nOverview of pathogenic mechanisms linking complement to kidney transplant injury. (A) During cognate interactions between alloreactive T \ncells and APCs, alternative pathway complement components are released and undergo activation, yielding C3a and C5a. Upon binding to their \nrespective G protein\u2013coupled receptors, these anaphylatoxins stimulate PKA and induce PI3K\u03b3-dependent pAKT, together amplifying alloreactive \nTh1 T cell expansion and inhibiting Treg induction, function, and stability, thus facilitating acute and chronic graft rejection. (B) The antigen-bound \ncomplement degradation product C3dg binds to B cell\u2013expressed CR2, lowering the threshold for B cell activation and antibody production. \nComplement may indirectly enhance antibody production by augmenting T cell help (not shown). Classical pathway\u2013dependent, complement\ufffemediated effector mechanisms initiated by cross-linking tissue-bound, donor-reactive (IgG) antibodies also contribute to allograft injury. Insertion \nof the MAC into the EC results in EC activation. C3a and C5a mediate chemoattraction and activation of polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells, which, \nthrough Fc receptors, ligate Fc portions of antibodies bound to endothelium, contributing to injury. (C) IR leads to the production of ROS, which \nin turn promote release of DAMPs, including HMGB1, chemokines, cytokines, and complement components, by ECs and tubular and infiltrating \ncells. Through alternative complement pathway activation, locally generated C3a and C5a contribute to EC and tubular cell activation and injury, \nenhancing inflammation and graft immunogenicity. (D) Locally produced (intragraft) and activated complement contributes to progressive injury \nand fibrosis, in part through stimulating the renin angiotensin system and driving\u00a0epithelial-mesenchymal transition.",

        "text": "Background\nDespite major advances in transplant medicine, which\ninclude continuous refinements of immunosuppressive\nstrategies, large registry analyses have failed to demon\ufffestrate major improvements in long-term survival of\nstandard kidney transplants over the last decades [1,2].\nRecent studies have underscored a dominant role of\nalloimmune injury as a leading cause of long-term graft\nloss. In this respect, the formation of antibodies against\npolymorphic donor antigens, commonly human leukocyte\nantigens (HLA), has proved to be an important trigger of\ngraft rejection [3-5]. Humoral rejection (antibody-medi\ufffeated rejection (AMR)) of organ transplants has been\nestablished to constitute a separate rejection entity, and in\nrecent years accurate biopsy-based and serological criteria\nfor this rejection type have been defined to provide a solid\nbasis for targeted treatment: microcirculation inflamma\ufffetion and injury; antibody-triggered C4 complement split\nproduct deposition (C4d) along peritubular capillaries;\nand detection of circulating donor-specific antibodies\n[6,7]. It has become evident that a considerable proportion\nof recipients develop features of AMR late after trans\ufffeplantation, a process culminating in chronic irreversible\ntissue damage, graft dysfunction and loss [8-10]. Indeed,\nthere are studies suggesting that newly formed donor\ufffespecific antibodies (DSA) represent the primary cause of\nlate graft loss [11-15].\nTreatment of AMR is a big challenge. For early acute\nAMR, various treatment protocols \u2013 which include anti\ufffebody depletion by apheresis, modulation of B-cell immun\ufffeity by intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), or targeting\ncritical components of innate immunity including comple\ufffement activation \u2013 were shown to potentially prevent and\nreverse rejection [5,16-18].\nFor late AMR, however, appropriate treatment still re\ufffemains to be established. A few anecdotal reports and\nsmall case series have suggested efficacy of distinct anti\ufffehumoral treatment modalities. While uncontrolled studies\nhave suggested stabilization of chronic AMR following\ntreatment with high-dose IVIG and CD20 antibody ri\ufffetuximab, at least in some patients [19-22], other reports\nhave shown that such treatment may not be sufficient to\nprevent the development of AMR and subsequent chronic\ninjury [23]. A major drawback of currently available treat\ufffement strategies may be that they do not directly affect the\nintegrity and function of long-lived alloantibody-producing\nplasma cells [24].\nOne attractive treatment concept could be the target\ufffeing of alloantibody-producing plasma cells. In this con\ufffetext, the use of bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor\napproved for the treatment of multiple myeloma, may be\na promising option. There is now increasing evidence\nthat proteasome inhibition could affect nonmalignant\nautoantibody or alloantibody-secreting cells [25-27]. In\nrecent years, numerous case series and anecdotal reports\nhave suggested efficacy of bortezomib treatment (com\ufffemonly part of multimodal treatment strategies) in redu\ufffecing levels of DSA, improving kidney function and\npreventing graft loss in patients experiencing acute AMR\n[28-30]. However, there are only scarce data on the effi\ufffecacy of bortezomib in treating late AMR processes. There\nare recent experimental and preliminary clinical data sug\ufffegesting a potential impact of bortezomib also on the\ncourse of late AMR [30-33]. In a recently published case\nof late chronic active AMR with a slow progressive deteri\ufffeoration of kidney function and increasing proteinuria,\nour study group could also demonstrate a profound\ndownregulation of DSA and a complete abrogation of\nbiopsy-proven antibody-triggered intragraft comple\ufffement activation following a single cycle of bortezomib\n[32]. Remarkably, bortezomib treatment was associated\nwith a consistent decrease in proteinuria and stabilization\nof graft function. As expected, advanced chronic lesions\n(severe transplant glomerulopathy) in this patient remained",
