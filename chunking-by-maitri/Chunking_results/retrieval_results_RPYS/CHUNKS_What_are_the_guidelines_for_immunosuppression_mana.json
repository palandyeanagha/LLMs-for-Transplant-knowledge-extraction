Since then, the use of immunosuppressants such\nas cyclosporine has made renal allografts a viable clinical option\n[3], but the process still has many challenges, including the\nmanagement of chronic and acute immune-mediated rejection of\nthe allograft, nephrotoxicity from immunosuppressants and\nantiviral drugs, and controlling opportunistic infections. To\nbalance these factors, clinical guidelines for the treatment of\nkidney transplant recipients (KTRs) generally suggest the use of\nintensive immunosuppression during the initial stages of the\nprocess, followed by a diminished dose of immunosuppressants if\nthere are no signs of acute rejection by 2\u20134 months after\ntransplantation [4].\nIn addition to the potential problem of immunological rejection\nof the allograft, between 1 and 10% of KTRs develop\nnephropathy associated with a non-enveloped DNA virus species\ncalled BK polyomavirus (BKV or BKPyV) [5\u20138]. Serological and\nPCR-based studies indicate that nearly all human beings are\nchronically infected with BKV [9,10]. Although chronic BKV\ninfection of the urinary tract is not known to be associated with\novert clinical symptoms in healthy individuals, opportunistic\nreplication of the virus in KTRs can lead to graft dysfunction or\nloss [11]. BKV can also cause a bladder condition known as\nhemorrhagic cystitis in bone marrow transplant recipients and in\ncancer patients treated with the immunosuppressant cyclophos\ufffephamide [12,13]. Clinical guidelines for these conditions therefore\nrecommend regular monitoring of serum or urinary BKV viral\nload and reduction of immunosuppression if signs of uncontrolled\nBKV replication are observed [4].\nIn pediatric KTRs, being BKV seronegative prior to transplan\ufffetation correlates with the risk of developing BKV associated\nnephropathy (BKVN) [14]. In adult KTRs, at least one study\nsuggested a significant correlation between donor BKV seroreac\ufffetivity and the risk of urinary shedding of BKV in KTRs [15].\nHowever, BKV seroprevalence is high in most adult populations\nand a variety of other studies have not uncovered clear\ncorrelations between KTR seroresponsiveness to BKV and\nresistance to BKV viremia or BKVN [16\u201318] and reviewed in\n[19].

        "text": "healthy individuals but does not lead to any known clinical disease.\nUnder immunosuppressed conditions, especially in renal trans\ufffeplant and bone marrow transplant recipients, the virus can\nreactivate from a persistent state to lytic infection, which results in\nsevere disease including polyomavirus-associated nephropathy\n(PVAN) and hemorrhagic cystitis (HC), respectively [2]. Unfortu\ufffenately, there is currently no FDA-approved, specific anti-BKPyV\ndrug available for treating these diseases. The common approach\nto control BKPyV reactivation is palliative care for HC patients, or\ncombining immunosuppression reduction with drugs that inhibit\nviral DNA replication for PVAN, although there are often\nconflicting outcomes with these treatment options [3].\nMuch of the knowledge about the polyomavirus lytic life cycle\ncomes from research performed on Simian Virus 40 (SV40). The\nviral genome, a circular double-stranded DNA molecule, is\ndelivered into the nucleus. Following nuclear entry, early proteins\nincluding the large T antigen (TAg) are expressed. TAg sets up the\nhost environment for viral DNA replication by inducing cells into\nS phase and, at the same time, inhibiting the p53-dependent\napoptotic pathway [4]. Initiation of viral DNA replication requires\nthe concerted efforts of TAg, replication protein A (RPA), DNA\npolymerase alpha-primase (Pol-prim), and topoisomerase I [5].\nNewly replicated viral DNA is encapsidated by the capsid proteins\nVP1, VP2, and VP3, and this is followed by viral egress and cell\nlysis, thus completing the life cycle. Although SV40 is well-studied,\nthere are differences between it and BKPyV. There is still much\nthat is unknown with regard to the interaction between host\nnuclear components and viral factors during BKPyV replication.\nIdentification and characterization of these interactions is\nextremely important, since it may reveal novel anti-viral thera\ufffepeutic targets.\nThe DNA damage response (DDR) is emerging as a cellular\nprocess that is targeted by a number of DNA and RNA viruses\n[6,7]. The DDR involves signaling cascades that are initiated\nwhen cells experience various types of DNA damage, and it\ncoordinates many cellular processes including cell cycle arrest,\nchromatin modification, and DNA repair to allow cells to repair\nthe damaged DNA [8,9]. This response is largely orchestrated by\ntwo major phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinases (PI3KKs):\nataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), and ATM and Rad3-related\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 August 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e1002898",

There are currently no evidence-based,\nsystematically developed recommendations on the diagnosis\nand management of children with SRNS available, with the\nexception of a focused document from KDIGO (Kidney\nDisease: Improving Global Outcomes) Glomerulonephritis\nguideline [6]. Therefore, the International Pediatric\nNephrology Association (IPNA) convened a clinical practice\nrecommendation (CPR) workgroup in December 2018 to de\ufffevelop CPRs for the diagnosis and management of children\nwith SRNS. Future research recommendations regarding key\noutcome measures in patients with SRNS are also presented.\nMethods\nOverview of the guideline project\nWe have followed the RIGHT (Reporting Items for practice\nGuidelines in HealThcare) Statement for Practice Guidelines\n[12]. Three groups were assembled: a core leadership group,\nan external expert group, and a voting panel. The core group\ncomprised 18 members of IPNA, including pediatric nephrol\ufffeogists, renal geneticists, epidemiologists, an adult nephrolo\ufffegist, and a renal pathologist. The individual expertise and re\ufffesponsibilities of the core group members are given in\nSupplementary Table S1. The external expert group included\n3 patient representatives and one dietician. The patient repre\ufffesentatives discussed the manuscript provided by the core\ngroup members within their local parents\u2019 association, and\ntheir suggestions were then incorporated into the manuscript.\nThe voting panel included 23 pediatric nephrologists includ\ufffeing 3\u20135 representatives of each IPNA Regional Society with\nexpertise in the management of SRNS in children. Voting\ngroup members were asked by electronic questionnaire to\nprovide a level of agreement on a 5-point scale (strongly dis\ufffeagree, disagree, neither agree/disagree, agree, strongly agree)\n(Delphi method). For topics that failed to achieve a 70% level\nof consensus, the recommendations were re-evaluated and\nmodified by the core group and then reviewed again by the\nvoting panel until a consensus level of > 70% was achieved.\nDeveloping the PICO questions\nWe developed PICO (Patient or Population covered,\nIntervention, Comparator, Outcome) questions as follows\n[13]: Population: Children (> 3 months and < 18 years) with\nSRNS; Intervention and Comparators: treatment compared\nwith no treatment, other treatment or placebo; Outcomes\nAddressed: We addressed recommendations for the diagnosis,\ntreatment, and follow-up of children with SRNS (including\nefficacy to induce remission and side effects of medications).\nLiterature search\nThe PubMed database was searched for studies published by\n15 September 2019; all systematic reviews of randomized con\ufffetrolled trials (RCTs) on treatment of SRNS in children, RCTs,\nprospective uncontrolled trials, observational studies, and reg\ufffeistry studies on diagnosis and treatment of children with SRNS,\nrestricted to human studies in English. Where possible, meta\ufffeanalyses of RCTs using risk ratios were cited from the updated\nCochrane systematic review regarding interventions for child\ufffehood steroid resistant NS (SRNS) [14]. Further details and a\nsummary of the publications used for this CPR are given in the\nSupplementary material (Supplementary Tables S2\u2013S5).\nGrading system\nWe followed the grading system of the American Academy of\nPediatrics (Fig. 1; [16]). The quality of evidence was graded\nas High (A), Moderate (B), Low (C), Very low (D), or Not\napplicable (X). The latter refers to exceptional situations\nwhere validating studies cannot be performed because benefit\nor harm clearly predominates.

BKV\nisolates are categorized into four genotypes. It is currently unclear whether the four genotypes are also serotypes. To\naddress this issue, we developed high-throughput serological assays based on antibody-mediated neutralization of BKV\ngenotype I and IV reporter vectors (pseudoviruses). Neutralization-based testing of sera from mice immunized with BKV-I or\nBKV-IV virus-like particles (VLPs) or sera from naturally infected human subjects revealed that BKV-I specific serum\nantibodies are poorly neutralizing against BKV-IV and vice versa. The fact that BKV-I and BKV-IV are distinct serotypes was\nless evident in traditional VLP-based ELISAs. BKV-I and BKV-IV neutralization assays were used to examine BKV type-specific\nneutralizing antibody responses in KTRs at various time points after transplantation. At study entry, sera from 5% and 49%\nof KTRs showed no detectable neutralizing activity for BKV-I or BKV-IV neutralization, respectively. By one year after\ntransplantation, all KTRs were neutralization seropositive for BKV-I, and 43% of the initially BKV-IV seronegative subjects\nshowed evidence of acute seroconversion for BKV-IV neutralization. The results suggest a model in which BKV-IV-specific\nseroconversion reflects a de novo BKV-IV infection in KTRs who initially lack protective antibody responses capable of\nneutralizing genotype IV BKVs. If this model is correct, it suggests that pre-vaccinating prospective KTRs with a multivalent\nVLP-based vaccine against all BKV serotypes, or administration of BKV-neutralizing antibodies, might offer protection\nagainst graft loss or dysfunction due to BKV associated nephropathy.\nCitation: Pastrana DV, Brennan DC, C\u00b8 uburu N, Storch GA, Viscidi RP, et al.

A high proportion of patients \nwith severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 \n(SARS-CoV-2) infection (the cause of COVID-19) pres\ufffeent with lymphopenia, and lymphocyte count has been \nnegatively associated with disease severity1\n. Critically ill \npatients with COVID-19 exhibit high levels of cytokines, \nparticularly IL-6, reinforcing the concept that hyper\ufffeinflammation may contribute to morbidity and mortal\ufffeity in this disease and underscoring the delicate balance \nbetween protective and dysregulated host immune \nresponses.\nImmunosuppressive agents used in the management \nof glomerular diseases and kidney transplant recipients \n(Supplementary Table\u00a01) have an inherent potential to \ncause lymphopenia and/or impair lymphocyte function. \nIn the absence of specific therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infec\ufffetions, most nephrology societies have issued recommen\ufffedations to reduce immunosuppression to levels that are \nconsidered safe, while acknowledging that balancing \nthe risk of infections against the aim of disease control \ncan be intricate even under \u2018normal\u2019 circumstances. \nHowever, such an approach is not feasible for patients \nwith a de\u00a0novo diagnosis of immune-mediated kidney \ndisease, disease relapse or transplant rejection.\nGlomerular diseases\nNo reports on treating glomerular diseases during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic exist to date. Our suggestions are \nbased on very little direct evidence but aim to balance \nthe need to maintain viral host defence mechanisms \nagainst the need to suppress the immune system to treat \nthe glomerular disease. The guiding principles of our \nsuggestions are to avoid oversuppression of T\u00a0cells and to \nconsider the use of immunosuppressive drugs that may \ninhibit mechanisms of kidney injury and the cytokine \nstorm that seems to be involved in the most severe cases \nof COVID-19.\nThree clinical scenarios can be envisaged in patients \nwith glomerulonephritis: first, either a new diagnosis \nor relapsing disease; second, the maintenance phase of \nimmunosuppressive treatment; and third, long-term \nremission with ongoing tapering of immunosuppression. \nThe decision to start immunosuppression in patients \nwith newly diagnosed or relapsing glomerulonephritis \nand concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infection should ideally \nbe based on kidney biopsy findings, kidney function, \nlevel of proteinuria, the expected tempo of the disease \nand comorbidities (Supplementary Table 2). If possible, \ntreatment should be steered towards oral therapy to \nreduce in-person interactions with health-care person\ufffenel and avoid potential viral transmission and excessive \nuse of personal protective equipment.\nDespite ongoing controversies owing to a theoreti\ufffecal increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe \nCOVID-19 in patients using renin\u2013angiotensin system \n(RAS) inhibitors, patients with proteinuria should be \ninitiated on RAS inhibitors, as numerous recommenda\ufffetions support their continued use during the pandemic2\n. \nInitiation of immunosuppression should be considered \nin patients with diseases in which rapid deterioration \nof kidney function is expected and in those with severe \nnephrotic syndrome, which is accompanied by increased \nsusceptibility to infections due to low IgG concentrations \nand depression of T\u00a0cell function3\n.\nIn patients receiving maintenance immunosuppres\ufffesion, an individualized risk\u2013benefit evaluation is neces\ufffesary to assess the risk of immunosuppression versus the \nrisk of glomerular disease relapse. If possible, patients \nwho have not been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 should \nstay at home, and maintenance administration of drugs \nCOVID-19: implications for \nimmunosuppression in kidney \ndisease and transplantation",

        "text": "6. Risks and benefits to transplant recipients\nAs has been discussed in several other reports, the attributable risk\nof immunosuppression on the development and severity of COVID-19 is\nunknown. Current knowledge is mainly based on recently published\ncase reports [16\u201320]. Previous reports on transplant recipient outcome\nfor other respiratory viruses and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome\nare contradictory [21,22] and several immunosuppressive agents are\neven hypothesized to have antiviral properties [23,24]. It is however\nevident that frail individuals, including patients with multiple co\ufffemorbidities, are at increased risk of COVID-19 [5].,\nOne could therefore\nargue that transplantation may in fact, in the longer run, ameliorate\nthat risk. In light of limited and contradictory evidence, and in part\ndriven by stretched and overwhelmed hospital capacity, the Dutch\ntransplant community was an early adopter of the recommendations\nmade by Kumar et al. (Table 1B) [6]. In general, this led to prudence in\nperforming kidney transplantation until the impact of induction and\nmaintenance immunosuppression on COVID-19 is more understood.\nDeceased-donor kidney transplantation is considered case-by-case in a\nshared decision process with the patient, carefully weighing the ur\ufffegency and benefit of transplantation against risks. This approach al\ufffelowed for regional differences among centers while sharing a similar\npolicy. More specifically, kidney and pancreas transplantations for\nwhich T- and/or B-cell depleting induction therapy is deemed necessary\n(ABO and Human Leukocyte Antigen-incompatible and other high-im\ufffemunological risk transplantations) are halted. Even though current\nevidence suggest that children are generally less impacted by COVID\ufffe19, pediatric kidney transplant programs are restricted similarly to\nadult programs. Given the high waiting list mortality and suboptimal or\nabsent alternative treatment options for end-stage disease, liver-, heart\ufffeand lung-transplantation should continue in principle. For liver it is\nagreed that transplantation should continue to be focused on the pa\ufffetients with the highest need, i.e. high-urgent cases, those with Model for\nEnd-stage Liver Disease (MELD) > 20, or with otherwise life-threa\ufffetening disease such as hepatocellular carcinoma approaching borders of\nMilan criteria (Table 1B). As discussed before, with progression of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, ICU capacity across the country is limited. As a\nresult, per March 25, all heart and lung transplant-centers have limed\ntheir capacity for now to urgent cases with low life expectancy if not\ntransplanted (Table 1B). It is expected that the need for urgent lung\ntransplantation may rise in the upcoming weeks for patients with severe\nARDS [25]. As community acquired risk for COVID-19 is high, it is\nagreed that COVID-19 positive patients could return on the active organ\nwaiting list after resolution of clinical symptoms and negative COVID\ufffe19 nasopharyngeal swab or sputum PCR (Table 1B). At this point, there\nare no specific criteria for these patients in the ET region, but mono\ufffeorgan failure with preserved rehabilitation capacity is generally re\ufffecommended.\nRegarding post-transplant care, all elective post-transplant out\ufffepatient care is replaced by telephone and e-consultations when possible.\nIn addition, centers shared local treatment protocols for transplant re\ufffecipients. Protocols were based on RIVM recommendations for therapy\nand included recommendations on triage (admission versus home\nmonitoring), adjustment of immunosuppression and drug-drug inter\ufffeactions [26] and international guidelines [27,28]. COVID registries\nwere started and linked to existing national and international (i.e.,\nEuropean ERACODA) databases [29].\n7. Impact of the pandemic on transplant activity\nThe total amount of all organ transplants markedly decreased from\n100 to 150 to 40 transplants per month in the first COVID-19 month, a",
