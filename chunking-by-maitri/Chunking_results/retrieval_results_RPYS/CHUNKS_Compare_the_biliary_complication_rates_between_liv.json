The\naim of this study was to analyze outcomes of LDLT in pediatric patients with ALF based on\nour center\u2019s experience.\nMaterial and methods\nWe enrolled 63 children (at our institution) with ALF who underwent liver transplantation\nbetween 1997 and 2016. Among them 24 (38%) underwent a LDLT and 39 (62%) received\na DDLT. Retrospectively analyzed patient clinical data included: time lapse between qualifi\ufffecation for transplantation and transplant surgery, graft characteristics, postoperative compli\ufffecations, long-term results post-transplantation, and living donor morbidity. Overall, we have\nmade a comparison of clinical results between LDLT and DDLT groups.\nResults\nFollow-up periods ranged from 12 to 182 months (median 109 months) for LDLT patients\nand 12 to 183 months (median 72 months) for DDLT patients. The median waiting time for a\ntransplant was shorter in LDLT group than in DDLT group. There was not a single case of\nprimary non-function (PNF) in the LDLT group and 20 out of 24 patients (83.3%) had good\nearly graft function; 3 patients (12.5%) in the LDLT group died within 2 months of transplan\ufffetation but there was no late mortality. In comparison, 4 out of 39 patients (10.2%) had PNF\nin DDLT group while 20 patients (51.2%) had good early graft function; 8 patients (20.5%)\ndied early within 2 months and 2 patients (5.1%) died late after transplantation. The LDLT\ngroup had a shorter cold ischemia time (CIT) of 4 hours in comparison to 9.2 hours in the\nDDLT group (p<0.0001).\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0193327 February 23, 2018 1 / 11\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Szymczak M, Kalici\u0144ski P, Kowalewski G,\nBroniszczak D, Markiewicz-Kijewska M, Ismail H, et\nal.

        "text": "INTRODUCTION\nSince the first liver transplant from a living donor\n(living donor liver transplantation : LDLT) was con\ufffeducted in Japan, about 15 years have passed. At the\nbeginning, the LDLT was regarded as an emergency\nprocedure until the availability of liver transplantation\n(LTx) from deceased donors. However, in Japan, the\nnumber of deceased donors is also very small since\nthe Organ Transplantation law was enacted in October\n1997. The LDLT serves as standard medical treatment\nof end-stage liver disease in Japan. Since it is trans\ufffeplanted from a living donor, the characteristic advan\ufffetage to which a liver transplant from a living donor\ngreatly differs from the LTx from deceased donors is\nthat the transplantable liver is of good quality in the\nfirst place. The donor livers can be evaluated, and be\nadequately prepared before transplantation. Further\ufffemore, operations for both the donor and the recipient\ncan be simultaneously performed, therefore, both warm\nand cold ischemic time can be minimized. As a result,\nwell-suited livers are procured. Secondly, it is being\nable to choose the time of the transplant operation.\nSince the donor has determined beforehand, an op\ufffeeration can be on standby-conducted for him in accor\ufffedance with the state of the recipients. Thirdly, since\nthe donor and recipient are relatives, as one specific\ndonor to one specific recipient, the indications for an\nLTx may be expanded compared to an LTx from a\ndeceased donor. On the other hand, many problems,\nsuch as size mismatching, an ABO-blood type incom\ufffepatible transplantation, the expansion of indication to\nhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a recurrence of post\ufffeoperative hepatitis C, and the donor\u2019s safety, are sur\ufffefacing according to the increase in the expansion of\nindication and number of cases after introduction of\nthe LDLT between an adult donor and an adult recipi\ufffeent.

However, the following problems are surfacing\nwith the increase in the number of LDLTs between adults : graft size mismatching, an ABO\nblood-type incompatible transplantation, the expansion of LDLT indication to hepatocellular\ncarcinoma (HCC), the relapse of hepatitis C after LDLT, marginal donors, and the freedom\nfrom immunosuppressive treatment. In this article we outline the present conditions of these\nproblems and the future view of the LDLT. J. Med.

        "text": "712 www.kjim.org https://doi.org/10.3904/kjim.2017.264\nThe Korean Journal of Internal Medicine Vol. 33, No. 4, July 2018\nThirty-five donors, 32 with leakage and three with \nstrictures, showed improvements following conserva\ufffetive treatment, with none of these patients experienc\ufffeing recurrence during a median follow-up of 12.8 years \n(range, 8.9 to 16.3).\nDISCUSSION\nAlthough right liver LDLT is regarded as the primary \ntreatment for selected adult patients with end-stage \nliver disease, concerns have been raised about donor \nsafety. LDLT donors can experience various compli\ufffecations, with biliary complications being the most fre\ufffequent. However, a multicenter survey of several recent \nlarge scale studies showed that donor hepatectomy can \nbe performed successfully, with minimal and easily \ncontrolled complications, by using a meticulous and \nwell-standardized technique [15,16]. In contrast to large\ufffescale studies, single center studies like ours have several \nadvantages. First, specific complications such as biliary \ncomplications could be handled in a more detailed and \nstandardized fashion. Second, unexpected intraoper\ufffeative factors and/or pathologic factors may be identi\ufffefied as important predictors during the investigation. \nTherefore, this study is one of few focusing on the clin\ufffeical course of biliary complications and the outcomes \nof endoscopic management of these complications in \nLDLT donors at a single center. \nThe present study found that the overall postopera\ufffetive complication rate was 27.2%. More than half of these \nwere biliary complications (14.5%, 49/337), with 10.6% \n(36/337) of patients experiencing biliary leakage and 3.9% \n(13/337) having biliary strictures, including one donor \nwho developed a stricture after resolution of the leakage. \nDonor morbidity rates associated with right hepatecto\ufffemy for LDLT have been reported to range from 0% to \n67%, with an average incidence of 31% [17]. The overall \nrate of biliary complications in LDLT donors has been \nreported to range from 6% to 9%, but the incidence has \nbeen found to vary among studies from 1.0% to 11.1% \n[6-9]. These variations in incidence rate may be due to \ndifferences in surgical skills or inconsistent definitions \nof complications and their grades. The incidence of bil\ufffeiary complications was somewhat higher in the present \nstudy than in previous studies. This higher incidence \nwas likely due to our inclusion of only right lobe donors, \nwho have been reported to have a higher rate of biliary \ncomplications, about 9% to 11% [10,11]. However, recent \nlarge-scale studies reported comparable outcomes in \nright lobe and left lobe donors [18-20]. These similar \noutcomes were likely due to strict donor selection and \ncumulative experience with surgical procedures and \nperioperative management [18-20].\nWe found that most biliary complications occurred \nduring the early postoperative period. Biliary leakage \nhas been found to occur more frequently in earlier than \nin late phase, with most of these patients showing im\ufffeprovements with conservative care. Biliary strictures de\ufffevelop later, with most requiring specific interventional \ntreatment [10,21,22]. In this study, 88.8% of patients with \nbiliary leakages and 23% of patients with biliary stric\ufffetures showed improvement following conservative treat\ufffement, findings consistent with those of previous reports \n[9,10,12,13,21,22]. All patients with biliary complications \nrequiring ERC improved without requiring surgical \nmanagement. ERC was technically successful in 81% of \npatients with strictures and 100% of those with leakage, \nand endobiliary stent insertion was clinically successful \nin 72.7% and 100%, respectively, with the remaining do\ufffenors responding to percutaneous treatment. Although \nthe management of biliary leakage varies among studies, \nthe approach to stricture is the same, endobiliary stent \ninsertion. The technical and clinical success rates of",

        "text": "Shin Hwang, et al. Liver retransplantation for adult recipients 3\nsion around the initial partial liver graft, especially at the \nconglomerated hilar structures, to make them suitable for \nLDLT. Thus, other 4 types of LDLT-associated retrans\ufffeplantation can be taken into account.\nThe most typical type of LDLT-associated retransplant\ufffeation might be early living donor-to-deceased donor re\ufffetransplantation. Any cause of early graft failure can be in\ufffedicated for this type of retransplantation if a deceased do\ufffenor organ is available: it includes primary non-function, \nearly severe dysfunction or major surgical complications \nconfined to the liver graft, which are much similar to \nthose of deceased donor liver transplantation. Although \nthe incidence of primary non-function following LDLT \nhas been sporadically commented in literature, the actual \nincidence has been unknown so far after exclusion of the \ntechnical factors during learning curve.5,6,10 According to \nthe Asan Medical Center experience, its incidence was \ndefinitely less than 1% if strict definition of primary \nnon-function was applied. Severe initial dysfunction of the \nliving donor liver graft was often associated with \nsmall-for-size graft, excessive venous congestion of the \nright lobe graft from hepatic outflow obstruction or portal \nflow steal syndrome. Serious hepatic artery-related com\ufffeplications including hepatic artery thrombosis occurred in \n2-5% at large-volume LDLT programs and became a \nleading cause of early graft failure following LDLT.11-13\nIntractable biliary complication also can be an indication \nof retransplantation because its clinical course could be \nintractable and it occasionally induced life-threatening \nsepsis.14,15 If the general condition of a patient can endure \nthe retransplantation procedure itself, there might be no \nabsolute contraindication specific for this type of retrans\ufffeplantation. Thus, it shares the same retransplantation in\ufffedication criteria with initial deceased donor liver trans\ufffeplantation.\nFor early living donor-to-living donor retransplantation, \nits eligibility criteria might be similar to those of early \nliving donor-to-deceased donor retransplantation, but tech\ufffenical feasibility should be considered first. The most im\ufffeportant point is the availability of hepatic arterial blood \nflow source. A reliable arterial flow source other than the \nhepatic artery proper is the right gastroepiploic artery be\ufffecause it can be easily mobilized toward the hepatic hilum \nafter detachment from the stomach and can be promptly \nenlarged to facilitate size-mismatching. The clinical sig\ufffenificance of this artery was proven in its use for \nLDLT.11,16 If it is not possible to use this artery before \nreoperation, living donor retransplantation should not be \nattempted or fresh arterial vessel graft should be sought \nfrom deceased organ donors.\nFor early deceased donor-to-living donor retransplant\ufffeation, its indications are exactly the same to those for \naforementioned living donor-to-living donor retransplant\ufffeation unless extensive hepatic artery thrombosis occurred. \nHilar dissection of the failed whole liver graft is com\ufffeparable to that of liver dissection during initial LDLT. If \nhepatic arterial thrombosis was the cause of graft failure, \nalternative arterial flow source such as right gastroepiploic \nartery should be searched first.\nLate deceased donor retransplantation after initial LDLT \nhas the same indication for ordinary late deceased donor \nretransplantation such as recurrence of hepatitis C cir\uffferhosis or chronic rejection. This type of retransplantation \nis considered to carry an increased risk comparable to the \nrepeated deceased donor retransplantation.17-20 As there is \nno short-cut to dissect heavy adhesions, the timing of de\ufffeceased donor and recipient operations should be ad\ufffeequately adjusted not to make the cold preservation time \ntoo much prolonged.21,22\nTECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR \nLDLT-ASSOCIATED RETRANSPLANTATION",
