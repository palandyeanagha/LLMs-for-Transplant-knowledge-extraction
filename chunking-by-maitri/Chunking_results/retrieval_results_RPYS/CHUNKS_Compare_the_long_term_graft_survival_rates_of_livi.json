Of\nthese transplants, those transplanted in children less\nthan 20 years old involved kidneys from 77 living do\ufffenors and 15 deceased donors [34].\nAccording to the report of Hattori et al., a total of\n540 children developed end-stage renal failure in the\n6 years between 2006 and 2011, accounting for an\nannual incidence of 3.5\u20134.7/PMP. Of note, preemptive\nkidney transplantation was performed in 22.3% of\nthese patients without recourse to peritoneal dialysis\nor hemodialysis [38].\nWhile the causes of end-stage renal failure in chil\ufffedren vary by age bracket in Japan, congenital anomal\ufffeies of the kidney and urinary tract are reported to be\nthe most frequent, followed by hereditary nephropa\ufffethy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis [38, 39].\nIn recent years, a total of 90 or so transplants have\nbeen performed in children annually (involving living\ndonors in more than 90% of cases), as well as six to\neight transplants (except 2013) from deceased donors\nfollowing the amendment of the Organ Transplant\nLaw in 2010 which now allowed transplants from\nsuch donors. Very few transplants have been per\ufffeformed in those aged less than 16 years old and those\naged 16\u201320 years old, despite their being assigned\nhigher scores and thus prioritized for kidney trans\ufffeplantation (Fig. 7) [2].\nThe prognosis\nThe Japan Society for Transplantation has reported on\npost-transplant survival rates among the transplant recipi\ufffeents including adults, stratifying by organ donor, living or\ndeceased, as well as by age bracket, demonstrating im\ufffeproved transplant outcomes over the years, irrespective of\nthe organ donors involved (Table 4) [34].\nSimilarly, post-transplant outcomes are shown to be\nimproving over the years, irrespective of the organ\ndonors, according to the report of the Japan Pediatric\nKidney Transplantation Clinical Statistics Subcommit\ufffetee, with the 5- and 10-year engraftment rates being\n96.4 and 92.3% in kidneys from living donors and\n83.5 and 68% from those from deceased donors, re\ufffespectively [40].\nThese data compare favorably with those reported\noverseas [41, 42].\nCurrently, ABO-incompatible kidney transplant\ufffeation is being performed in about 10% of all kidney\nrecipients, accounting for a greater proportion than\nthat reported for the US counterparts (0.2%), while\nthe modality appears to be associated with better\noutcomes, leading to re-transplantation being\nrequired only in 3\u20134% of ABO-incompatible kidney\nrecipients, compared to 8.3% in the USA [43].\nPreferential organ allocation to pediatric\ntransplant candidates\nWhile the reported engraftment rates argue for the\nuse of pediatric hearts in pediatric transplant candi\ufffedates, there are reported cases of bilateral kidneys be\ufffeing transplanted from a pediatric donor to an adult\nrecipient not only because of similar engraftment and\nsurvival rates reported between children and adults\nbut because of its role in maintaining adequate renal func\ufffetion. Of note, however, there is an increasing focus on the\npreferential use of kidneys from pediatric donors in\nFig. 7 Number of pediatric deceased-donor kidney transplants performed in Japan\nNishimura et al.

OPTN policy prioritizes organ\nallocation to multiorgan candidates before kidney-alone candi\ufffedates when the candidate is in the same donor service area as\nthe donor.4 A paired kidney analysis of multiorgan transplanta\ufffetion by Choudhary et al.13 demonstrated inferior survival when\na kidney is allocated to an SLK recipient compared to the con\ufffetralateral mate kidney allocated to KTA. Kidneys used for SLK\ntransplants have lower kidney donor profile index (KDPI) and\nthus have higher expected longevity.15 Among the SLK trans\ufffeplants, 49% of donor kidneys had a KDPI <35%, that would\nlikely be offered to pediatric patients on the KTA waitlist. On an\naverage, 250 high-quality donor kidneys per year are being\nutilized by SLK transplants that otherwise would have been\noffered to one of the prioritized groups on the KTA wait-list,\nsuch as pediatric, young adult or highly sensitized patients.\nIt is not entirely clear which patients with renal dysfunction\nwould benefit from SLK. Centers err on the side of caution\nwhile selecting candidates for SLK, as it is hard to predict if\nthe renal dysfunction prior to liver transplant is reversible or\nnot. There have not been standard medical criteria for the\nevaluation of patients with renal dysfunction in advanced liver\ndisease requiring liver transplantation.\nIs renal dysfunction irreversible in a potential liver\ntransplant candidate?\nThe decision whether a liver transplant candidate with renal\ndysfunction should receive SLK versus LTA depends on the\nability to predict whether the kidney disease is reversible or\nnot. Renal function is commonly assessed by using a serum\ncreatinine-based formula to calculate glomerular filtration rate\n(GFR), which is not very reliable in patients with liver disease.\nMuscle mass, proximal tubular secretion and medications can\naffect serum creatinine level.

Compared with standard criteria donor(SCD) kidneys,\nkidneys from ECDs can be associated with a higher rate of delayed\ngraft function(DGF), primary non-function(PNF),acute rejection\nand a more complicated postoperative course, resulting in inferior\nlong-term graft survival overall [7\u201310]. Although ECD kidneys\nhave an overall 1.7 times greater risk for graft failure [3], it has also\nbeen shown that transplantation of these kidneys has a significant\nsurvival benefit when compared with dialysis treatment[11],\nespecially for elderly recipients [12].\nTo maximize the benefit of donated kidneys, two kidney\npreservation methods have been developed over the past 30 years,\nnamely hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) and static cold\nstorage (CS)[13]. Static cold storage, with solutions designed in the\n1980s, remains the gold standard in kidney transplantation.\nHowever, it has been reported that SC was unable to fully protect\nECD kidneys, while HMP could mitigate the deleterious effects of\nCS, reducing the incidence of DGF for ECD kidney transplan\ufffetations [14,15].\nTo better understand whether HMP could obtain better\noutcomes in ECD kidney transplantation compared to CS, We\nconducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available\nstudies. We assessed the impact of HMP on rates of DGF, PNF\nand one-year graft and patient survival.

Little is known about the incremental health and economic gain from transplanting those with\nco-morbidities compared to remaining on dialysis. The aim of our study is to estimate the average and incremental survival\nbenefits and health care costs of listing and transplantation compared to dialysis among individuals with varying co\ufffemorbidities.\nMethods: A probabilistic Markov model was constructed, using current outcomes for patients with defined co-morbidities\ntreated with either dialysis or transplantation, to compare the health and economic benefits of listing and transplantation\nwith dialysis.\nFindings: Using the current waiting time for deceased donor transplantation, transplanting a potential recipient, with or\nwithout co-morbidities achieves survival gains of between 6 months and more than three life years compared to remaining\non dialysis, with an average incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of less than $50,000/LYS, even among those with\nadvanced age. Age at listing and the waiting time for transplantation are the most influential variables within the model. If\nthere were an unlimited supply of organs and no waiting time, transplanting the younger and healthier individuals saves\nthe most number of life years and is cost-saving, whereas transplanting the middle-age to older patients still achieves\nsubstantial incremental gains in life expectancy compared to being on dialysis.\nConclusions: Our modelled analyses suggest transplanting the younger and healthier individuals with end-stage kidney\ndisease maximises survival gains and saves money. Listing and transplanting those with considerable co-morbidities is also\ncost-effective and achieves substantial survival gains compared with the dialysis alternative. Preferentially excluding the\nolder and sicker individuals cannot be justified on utilitarian grounds.\nCitation: Wong G, Howard K, Chapman JR, Chadban S, Cross N, et al.

Moderate and severe\nrenal dysfunction was reported as associated with poor graft\nand patient survival following LTA in a United Network of\nOrgan Sharing (UNOS) registry analysis.5 In a study performed\nby Gonwa et al.,\n3 5-year patient survival rates following\ndeceased donor LTA were 79.1%, 72.2%, and 63.1% in\nJournal of Clinical and Translational Hepatology 2018 vol. 6 | 289\u2013295 289\nCopyright: \u00a9 2018 Authors.
