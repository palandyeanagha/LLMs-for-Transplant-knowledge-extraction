Bron\ufffechiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is defined by the\npresence of the airflow limitation (FEV1/FVC ratio <\n0.70) among those who developed CLAD. Mixed pheno\ufffetype is defined by both features of RAS (\u226510% decline of\nTLC) and BOS (FEV1/FVC ratio < 0.70) among LTRs\nwith CLAD. Undefined is considered when phenotype of\nCLAD is difficult to be categorized among patients with\nCLAD [5].\nStatistical analysis\nCategoric variables were reported as percentages, and\ncontinuous variables as medians (interquartile range\n(IQR)) as appropriate. Differences between groups were\nassessed with chi-square or Fisher\u2019s exact tests for cat\ufffeegoric variables and Mann Whitney test (two groups) or\nKruskal-Wallis (three groups) as appropriate for con\ufffetinuous variables. Statistical analyses were performed\nusing EZR (Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical Uni\ufffeversity, Omiya, Japan), which is a graphical user interface\nfor R (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing,\nVienna, Austria), where a two-sided P value was calcu\ufffelated.

Bronchiolitis \nobliterans syndrome (BOS) and restrictive allograft syndrome \n(RAS) are considered to be the two main phenotypes of CLAD \n(2, 3). BOS is characterized by persistent airflow obstruction in \nthe absence of a restrictive ventilation defect and imaging studies \nthat may be unremarkable or show air trapping (4). Early-onset \nBOS, developing within 2 or 3\u00a0years after LT, is associated with \nparticularly unfavorable outcomes, resulting in high morbidity \nand mortality soon after LT (5, 6). For RAS, various diagnostic \ncriteria have been used in different studies, but overall, RAS is \ncharacterized by a restrictive ventilation defect and radiological \nsigns of fibrosis or infiltrates (7\u20139). Prognosis is worse for RAS \nthan BOS, and for RAS, time of diagnosis after transplant does not \nseem to influence survival (10). Diagnosis of BOS or RAS requires \nexclusion of alternative diagnoses, and this may be challenging (1).\nAlthough the pathogenic mechanisms and the risk factors \nimplicated in BOS and RAS are not fully elucidated (4, 11), \nrecent literature provides increasing evidence and novel insights. \nConcerning BOS, most studies emphasize the role of multiple \nallo-immune and non-immune mechanisms (4, 11\u201313), but \ninformation on the risk factors of RAS or a comparative analysis \nof RAS and BOS is limited (10, 14). Identification of clinical risk \nfactors associated with specific CLAD phenotypes is of particular \nclinical importance as it may assist patient risk stratification, \noptimize follow-up, or allow early intervention for potentially \nmodifiable factors.\nMultivariate prediction models are being increasingly \ndeveloped to help health-care providers estimate the prob\ufffeability of a future disease (15). A few studies described clinical \npredictive models for BOS (16\u201319), but to our knowledge, no \nstudy has used this approach for BOS and RAS. The SysCLAD",

However, long-term \nsurvival after lung transplantation continues to be the worst among all solid organ transplants, with a \n10-year survival of only 20% (1). The predominant cause of these poor outcomes is the high incidence of \nchronic graft failure arising from immunologically mediated graft injury and progressive fibrosis termed \nchronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) (2). Among patients with CLAD, a particularly poor prognosis \nis associated with a recently characterized subtype designated as restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS) (3). \nRAS develops in approximately 30% of the patients with CLAD, and it is characterized by a restrictive pat\ufffetern of decline in lung function and a fulminant course, which leads to respiratory failure and death (3\u20135).\nThe histopathological presentations of RAS are more complex and varied than those of bronchiolitis \nobliterans syndrome (BOS), the other common presentation of CLAD. While bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) \nor fibrotic remodeling limited to the small airways is a predominant feature of BOS, a spectrum of histologic \nfeatures have been described in RAS lungs (3, 6, 7). These include more acute presentations of diffuse alveolar \ndamage (DAD) and intraalveolar fibrinous exudates, as well as chronic end-stage fibrosis and pleuroparenchy\ufffemal fibroelastosis (PPFE) (5, 8\u201310). Pleural fibrosis extending into the lungs along the interlobular septa, as \nwell as fibrosis emanating from the bronchovascular bundles, is seen pointing to a more fulminant fibropro\ufffeliferative graft response. Lymphocytic aggregates in the perivascular and peribronchial regions, macrophage \naccumulation in the airspaces, and presence of B cells have been described (10, 11). This diverse spectrum of \npathologies in human RAS specimens, which are obtained at various stages of disease pathogenesis, suggests \nUnderstanding the distinct pathogenic mechanisms that culminate in allograft fibrosis and \nchronic graft failure is key in improving outcomes after solid organ transplantation. Here, we \ndescribe an F1 \u2192 parent orthotopic lung transplant model of restrictive allograft syndrome \n(RAS), a particularly fulminant form of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), and identify \na requisite pathogenic role for humoral immune responses in development of RAS. B6D2F1/J \n(H2-b/d) donor lungs transplanted into the parent C57BL/6J (H2-b) recipients demonstrated a \nspectrum of histopathologic changes, ranging from lymphocytic infiltration, fibrinous exudates, \nand endothelialitis to peribronchial and pleuroparenchymal fibrosis, similar to those noted in the",

It is characterized radiologically by features\nsuggestive of a chronic interstitial pneumonia with\nupper lobe predominance, and histologically by\npleural fibrosis and parenchymal fibroelastosis in a\npredominantly subpleural distribution, with a sharp\ndemarcation between fibroelastotic and unaffected\nlung parenchyma, and with the presence of\nfibroblastic foci at this interface. A limited number\nof cases with similar radiologic and pathologic\nfeatures have also been reported,8\u201314 including a\nvery recent article by Reddy et al,14 suggesting a\nbroader spectrum of histopathologic findings.\nIn our present study, we found typical features of\npleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis in all patients in\nwhom clinical onset of restrictive allograft syn\ufffedrome pre-dated the lung pathology specimen. The\npleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis in these cases was\npredominantly subpleural; however, unlike most\nprevious reports of pleuroparenchymal fibroelasto\ufffesis, involvement in other areas (eg centrilobular,\nparaseptal) was also noted in a significant minority\nof cases.\nConcurrent obliterative bronchiolitis was identi\ufffefied in a majority of cases, an observation that\nmirrors the finding by von der Thusen et al,\n15 of\nobliterative bronchiolitis in 4 of 4 patients with\npleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis post bone marrow\ntransplantation. This finding suggests that although\npatients with restrictive allograft syndrome should\nnot be classified as bronchiolitis obliterans\nsyndrome due to their distinct clinical, radiologic\nand pathologic features, the decline in pulmonary\nfunction in patients with restrictive allograft\nsyndrome may result from a combination of\nrestrictive deficits secondary to pleuroparenchymal\nfibroelastosis and varying degrees of obstructive\ndeficits resulting from concurrent obliterative\nbronchiolitis.\nConsistent with our recent finding that onset of\nrestrictive allograft syndrome is often preceded by\nthe presence of diffuse alveolar damage in biop\ufffesies,20 we further found that pleuroparenchymal\nFigure 4 Obliterative bronchiolitis lesions in patients with\nrestrictive allograft syndrome.

        "text": "Introduction\nLung transplantation is a therapeutic option for end-stage\npulmonary disorders. Unfortunately, lung rejection is a\ncommon complication with an incidence and severity that\nexceed those of all other solid organ transplantations (1,\n2). Chronic lung allograft rejection, known as bronchioli\ufffetis obliterans syndrome (BOS), is the leading cause of mor\ufffetality after lung transplantation and is the reason the 7-\nyear survival after lung transplantation is only 31% (1, 2).\nBOS is a chronic inflammatory process, demonstrat\ufffeing features of dysregulated repair. It is characterized\nby persistent peribronchiolar leukocyte infiltration\nthat eventually disrupts the basement membrane, sub\ufffemucosa, and airway epithelium (1, 2). Fibroprolifera\ufffetion follows with increased numbers of mesenchymal\ncells, submucosal matrix deposition, and granulation\ntissue formation, ultimately leading to fibro-oblitera\ufffetion of airways (1, 2). Importantly, acute lung allograft\nrejection is the major risk factor for the development of\nBOS and is characterized by a perivascular/bronchiolar\nrecruitment of mononuclear cells that ultimately leads\nto architectural destruction (1, 2).\nBOS is classically described as an ongoing immuno\ufffelogical event; however, aggressive immunosuppressive\ntherapy does not affect the naturally occuring develop\ufffement of this disorder (1, 2). Moreover, the specific medi\ufffeators that orchestrate the persistent recruitment of\nleukocytes leading to fibro-obliteration have not been\nfully elucidated. MCP-1 is a CC chemokine, and it is a\npotent chemoattractant for mononuclear cells, specifi\ufffecally mononuclear phagocytes, CD45RO+ T lympho\ufffecytes, B cells, and NK cells (3, 4). MCP-1 is involved in\nchronic inflammatory/fibroproliferative diseases such\nas rheumatoid arthritis (5). MCP-1 binds and signals\nthrough a seven-transmembrane-spanning G pro\ufffetein\u2013coupled receptor, CCR2 (6).\nWe hypothesize that the continuum of lung allograft\nrejection from acute to chronic rejection results from a\npersistent immunological/inflammatory insult to the\nallograft airways. This persistent insult is due, in part,\nto the expression of MCP-1 and its interaction with its\nmajor mononuclear cell receptor, CCR2, which leads to\nchronic peribronchiolar leukocyte infiltration and\neventual obliteration of the airways.
