Machine Perfusion: Future Preservation Method\nConclusions: Machine perfusion is superior to CS on improving short-term outcomes\nfor human liver transplantation, with a less clear effect in the longer term. Hypothermic\nmachine perfusion but not NMP conducted significantly protective effects on EAD\nand biliary complications. Further RCTs are warranted to confirm MP\u2019s superiority\nand applications.\nKeywords: machine perfusion, static cold storage, graft preservation, liver transplantation, meta-analysis\nINTRODUCTION\nLiver transplantation (LT) has been the optimal treatment\nfor patients with end-stage liver disease. Rapidly increasing\ndemands for LT have also caused severe shortage of donor liver\norgans in clinical application. To overcome this discrepancy,\ndonation after circulatory death (DCD), extended criteria donors\n(ECDs), living liver donation, or marginal liver grafts are\nincreasingly accepted to expand the limited donor pool. However,\nstudies have suggested that these additional liver donation\nsources often suffered from longer warm ischemic periods and\nworse ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury (IRI) during LT, resulting\nin increased risk of early allograft dysfunction (EAD), primary\nnonfunction (PNF), biliary complications, and poorer long-term\ngraft and patient survival (1).\nDuring transplantation, the quality of donor liver preservation\nis an important factor on maintaining and improving transplant\noutcomes of patients. Standard static cold storage (CS)\nremains the gold standard method for liver graft preservation.\nNevertheless, the effectiveness of CS preservation is currently\nunable to provide sufficient protection of liver grafts against IRI,\nespecially for prolonged CS of DCD and marginal livers, often\nresulting in increased risk of EAD, PNF, and biliary complications\n(2). As an alternative preservation strategy, machine perfusion\n(MP) can provide a continuous circulation of metabolic\nsubstrates and antioxidants, imitating the physiological processes\nwhile flushing inflammatory cytokine and toxins from the graft.\nTherefore, MP has been proposed as a better strategy to protect or\nrescue marginal liver grafts by attenuating the cytokine mediated\nIRI (3).\nMachine perfusion has been widely used for preservation\nin kidney transplantation. Plenty of evidence suggested MP\u2019s\npriority in improving early graft function, reducing the risk of\ndelayed graft function (DGF), and enhancing ECD graft survival\nafter renal transplantation (4). Unlike kidney transplantation,\nMP remained relatively limited in clinical LTs due to the high\nmetabolism rates of liver, relatively complicated perfusion system\nAbbreviations: AST, aspartate aminotransferase; ALT, alanine transaminase; CI,\nconfidence interval; CS, cold storage; DBD, deceased brain donor; DCD, donor\nafter cardiac death; EAD, early allograft dysfunction; ECD, extended criteria\ndonors; HAT, hepatic artery thrombosis; HMP, hypothermic machine perfusion;\nHOPE, hypothermic oxygenated perfusion; IRI, ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury; IC,\nischemic cholangiopathy; LT, liver transplantation; MP, machine perfusion; MELD,\nmodel for end-stage liver disease; NOS, Newcastle\u2013Ottawa Quality Assessment\nScale; NMP, normothermic machine perfusion; OR:odds ratio; PNF, primary\nnonfunction; PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta\ufffeAnalysis.\nconsisting of hepatic and portal route, poor practicality, and\nhigh costs.\nLarge animal and human experimental studies have suggested\nthat MP may provide better protection of liver grafts against\nIRI than CS (5, 6).

Compared with standard criteria donor(SCD) kidneys,\nkidneys from ECDs can be associated with a higher rate of delayed\ngraft function(DGF), primary non-function(PNF),acute rejection\nand a more complicated postoperative course, resulting in inferior\nlong-term graft survival overall [7\u201310]. Although ECD kidneys\nhave an overall 1.7 times greater risk for graft failure [3], it has also\nbeen shown that transplantation of these kidneys has a significant\nsurvival benefit when compared with dialysis treatment[11],\nespecially for elderly recipients [12].\nTo maximize the benefit of donated kidneys, two kidney\npreservation methods have been developed over the past 30 years,\nnamely hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) and static cold\nstorage (CS)[13]. Static cold storage, with solutions designed in the\n1980s, remains the gold standard in kidney transplantation.\nHowever, it has been reported that SC was unable to fully protect\nECD kidneys, while HMP could mitigate the deleterious effects of\nCS, reducing the incidence of DGF for ECD kidney transplan\ufffetations [14,15].\nTo better understand whether HMP could obtain better\noutcomes in ECD kidney transplantation compared to CS, We\nconducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available\nstudies.

However, 1-year graft survival was\ncomparable in both groups (49).\nFurthermore, in another RCT, kidneys were either preserved\nby HMP or SCS. In accordance with Moers as well as\nJochmans, the primary end-point was the occurrence of DGF.\nSecondary endpoints were primary non-function as well as graft\nsurvival. Both the risk of DGF and the incidence of non\ufffefunction were significantly reduced by HMP in their cohort.\nOne-year graft survival and function could be improved by\ndynamic cold graft preservation (52). Despite these findings,\nthe importance of different factors such as the impact of CIT\nand the combination of CIT with HMP have to be mentioned.\nCIT is a known independent risk factor for DGF. In order\nto investigate which kidney graft may further benefit from\nHMP prior to transplantation, Kox et al. analyzed prospectively\ncollected data from the \u201cMachine Perfusion Trial.\u201d A total of 752\nrenal transplants were included with 376 dynamically preserved\nkidneys and 376 statically preserved grafts. They identified CIT\nas an independent risk factor for DGF. Furthermore, HMP did\nnot prevent DGF if CIT exceeded 10 h (51).\nThe optimal timepoint for, as well as the optimal duration of,\nHMP is still a matter of debate. HMP can be used either as a\nprimary preservation method or in the end-ischemic phase as\na reconditioning tool. Matos et al. were able to show a faster\nrecovery of renal function if grafts were subjected to HMP prior\nto transplantation after a mean SCS period of 22 h. MP time was\nat least 6 h. However, this beneficial effect was limited to donors\nunder the age of 50, who represent a rather selective group (94).\nFurther studies followed, indicating a beneficial effect of MP in\nthe end-ischemic phase by displaying a reduction of DGF, as\nwell as an improved organ acceptance. This last positive trend is\nattributed mainly to the possibility of organ monitoring (95, 96).\nNMP of the Kidney\nNMP of the kidney may eventually resolve many issues\nrelated to damage induced by ischemic phases. The idea of\npreserving kidney grafts under almost physiological conditions\nwith the possibility of real-life assessment of the graft prior to\ntransplantation sounds intriguing. However, while the number\nof preclinical studies using animal models as well as discarded\nhuman kidneys is steadily increasing, evidence for NMP of\nthe kidney in a clinical setting is rather poor. Hosgood et al.\nwere first to transform preclinical experience into clinical reality\nby transplanting a 62-year-old ECD kidney into a 55-year old\nrecipient. After 11 h of SCS, the graft was perfused with a\nplasma-free red cell-based solution at 33.9\u25e6C for 35 min prior\nto transplantation. Although a slow graft function was observed,\nthe patient remained dialysis free with a serum creatinine level\nof 132 \u00b5mol/L at 3 months post-transplantation. In contrast, the\nrecipient of the opposite kidney developed DGF (64). Based on\nthis first success, the Leicester group translated NMP into clinical\nreality on a larger scale.

Articles from the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases were searched and all studies reporting\noutcomes from HMP versus CS methods of kidney preservation were included in this meta-analysis. The parameters\nanalyzed included the incidence of delayed graft function (DGF), primary non-function (PNF) and one-year graft and patient\nsurvival.\nResults: A total of seven studies qualified for the review, involving 2374 and 8716 kidney grafts with HMP or CS preservation\nrespectively, all from ECD donors. The incidence of delayed graft function (DGF) was significantly reduced with an odd\nratio(OR) of 0.59 (95% CI 0.54\u20130.66, P,0.001) and one-year graft survival was significantly improved with an OR of 1.12 (95%\nCI 1.03\u20131.21, P = 0.005) in HMP preservation compared to CS. However, there was no difference in the incidence of PNF (OR\n0.54, 95% CI 0.21\u20131.40, P = 0.20), and one-year patient survival (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.94\u20131.02, P = 0.36) between HMP and CS\npreservation.\nConclusions: HMP was associated with a reduced incidence of DGF and an with increased one-year graft survival, but it was\nnot associated with the incidence of PNF and one-year patient survival.\nCitation: Jiao B, Liu S, Liu H, Cheng D, Cheng Y, et al.

Because of a persistent\ndonor organ shortage, kidneys from expanded criteria donors\n(ECDs) are currently accepted by many centers and have been\nsuccessfully transplanted to increase the donor pool [2,3], thereby\nfacilitating timely kidney transplantation for elderly recipients who\nwould not survive long waiting periods [4,5] ECDs are defined as\nallografts from deceased donors older than 60 years of age and\nthose from donors aged 50\u201359 years old with at least two of the\nfollowings characteristics: history of hypertension, serum creati\ufffenine greater than 1.5 mg/dL or cerebrovascular as the cause of\ndeath[6].
