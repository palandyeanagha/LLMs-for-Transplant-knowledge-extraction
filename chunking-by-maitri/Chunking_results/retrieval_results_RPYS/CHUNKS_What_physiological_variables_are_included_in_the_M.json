The mean eGFR was significantly lower in the CI-AKI group (p<0.05).\nDiscussion\nAcute kidney injury can develop via numerous mechanisms in patients with liver cirrhosis. The\nhemodynamic abnormalities and bacterial translocation from the intestines are predisposing factors for this.\nIn these conditions, IC may simply serve as a trigger for AKI [2]. In order to obtain more authentic results, we\nstrived to exclude conditions that are associated with AKI in liver cirrhosis. This is detailed in the\nmethodology section.\nThe frequency of CI-AKI in our study was 5.1%. This is relatively lower as compared to some previous\nstudies done on this particular topic; a previous study by Safi et al. concluded a frequency of 17.9%. Another\nrecent study found that 8.8% of the LC patients developed CI-AKI. An older study concluded a frequency of\n25% [1-3]. All of these were retrospective studies and the differing incidences may be because of different\nexclusion criteria and patient populations. The studies with the higher incidence had a more relaxed\nexclusion criterion, which may have affected the overall results. Our lower frequency may be the result of\nmore stringent exclusion criteria.\nWe did not find any association between CI-AKI and age or gender. The former is supported by previous\nstudies [1-3]. A few past studies have concluded a relationship between CI-AKI and a postmenopausal state\nin women. Although we did not find any association to gender, this may be because most of our patients\nwere young and probably not in the menopausal category. It is postulated that after menopause the\nbeneficial effect of estrogen against cardiovascular and renal disease is lost, making individuals more prone\nto kidney insults [1,6].\nThe CP and MELD scores are widely used for assessment of prognosis in LC [7]. The MELD-Na score\nadditionally incorporates serum sodium levels into the MELD score [8]. The higher these scores, the worse\nthe prognosis and mortality in advanced liver disease. Table 2 summarizes an important finding of our\nstudy; patients who developed CI-AKI had worse CP, MELD, and MELD-Na scores as compared to those who\n2018 Ul Abideen et al. Cureus 10(5): e2707.

In terms of the Child-Pugh classifi cation, patients \nwere scored according to standard criteria as done in cli\ufffenical practice and allocated into three groups based on \ntheir Child\u2019s class (i.e., Class A, Class B or Class C). With \nregard to MELD scoring, the following standard formula \nwas used: 9.6 \u00d7 loge (creatinine mg/dL) + 3.8 \u00d7 loge (total \nbilirubin mg/dL) + 11.2 \u00d7 loge (INR) + 6.4. In addition, the \nfollowing scoring modifi cations as used by the United Ne\ufffetwork for Organ Sharing (UNOS) were made: values of \ncreatinine, bilirubin, and INR below 1 were rounded to 1, \nand creatinine was assigned a value of 4 if patients had \nreceived hemodialysis at least twice within the last 7 days \nprior to scoring. MELD scores with and without UNOS mo\ufffedifi cations were calculated and no signifi cant difference \nwas observed. We additionally calculated MELD-Na by \nadding MELD to 1.59 \u00d7 (135 \u2013 Na) which has been shown \nto predict the mortality in patients with cirrhosis.\nThe etiology of cirrhosis, presence of ascites and he\ufffepatic encephalopathy were recorded for all patients. The \nvarious etiologies of cirrhosis were determined based on \nhistory of alcohol intake of 80 gm/day for males or 60 gm/\nday for females for at least 10 years for alcoholic cirrhosis, \nand presence of hepatitis B and C specifi c antigen/anti\ufffebodies for post hepatitis cirrhosis and history established \nautoimmune disease for autoimmune causes. In the ab\ufffesence of any of aforementioned evidence, the etiology of \ncirrhosis was recorded as unknown. Ascites and hepatic \nencephalopathy were evaluated clinically and rated as fo\ufffellows: 0 = none; 1 = medically controlled; 2 = poorly con\ufffetrolled. Laboratory data required for clinical assessment \nResults: QT-interval prolongation was detected in 63.5% patients and 57.7% met the criteria for low-voltage \nQRS. Patients with prolonged QT-interval had higher Child-Pugh scores (9.58 \u00b1 2.5 vs. 8.16 \u00b1 2.29 respec\ufffetively, p = 0.04) but model for end-stage liver diseases scores was similar in those with prolonged QT and \nlow-voltage electrocardiogram. The frequency of prolonged QT interval and low-voltage QRS were similar \namong patients with different Child-Pugh classes. Heart rate was also higher in patients with low-voltage \nelectrocardiogram (89 \u00b1 15 beats per minute vs. 79 \u00b1 16 beats per minute, p = 0.01). Mean QRS voltage in \nprecordial leads was lower in those with ascites (8.5 \u00b1 2.6 mV vs. 11.8 \u00b1 3.4 mV, p = 0.006).\nConclusion: Electrocardiographic changes are common in cirrhosis regardless of the disease severity. Low-\n-voltage QRS may be related to anthropomorphic changes and development of ascites in these patients. \nKeywords:\nLiver disease \nLow-voltage \nelectrocardiogram\nQT interval\n127_136_Puvodni sdeleni Pourafkari.indd 128 10/04/2017 11:16:16",

The Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index comprises \nage, AST, ALT and platelet count and is calculated with \na more complicated formula; it has moderate accu\uffferacy (AUROC 0.83 for detecting F3 fibrosis), which is \ncomparable to that of the NAFLD fibrosis score61.\nThe NAFLD fibrosis score was specifically derived \nand validated in patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD62. \nThe formula consists of age, BMI, presence of impaired \nfasting glucose or diabetes mellitus, AST:ALT ratio, plate\ufffelet count and serum albumin levels. It has an AUROC of \n0.82 in detecting F3 fibrosis and has been more exten\ufffesively validated than the other scores63. Importantly, the \nscore has been shown to predict liver decompensation \nand mortality in patients with NAFLD64.\nThe BARD score (calculated from BMI, AST:ALT \nratio and diabetes mellitus presence) was also derived \nfrom a large American NAFLD cohort; it has mod\ufffeerate accuracy in detecting F3 fibrosis in subsequent \nvalidation studies (AUROC 0.69\u20130.81)65.\nAlthough these scores are less accurate than spe\ufffecific fibrosis markers, they have high applicability, as \nthe components are all readily available to clinicians. \nAlthough some scores require complex calculations, \nthe availability of online calculators and corresponding \napps has rendered this hurdle less relevant. Besides, these \nscores have high negative predictive value in excluding \nadvanced fibrosis and liver-related events and are there\ufffefore reasonable screening tools particularly when more \nsophisticated tests are unavailable66.\nSpecific fibrosis markers\nSpecific fibrosis markers reflect fibrogenesis and/or \nfibrinolysis. Although there is overlap in values across \nfibrosis stages, some proprietary panels (such as \nFibroTest and FibroMeter) provide the exact predicted \nfibrosis stage in the report. Liver fibrosis devel\ufffeops through the hepatic deposition of extracellular \nmatrix (ECM), of which hyaluronic acid (HA), a non\ufffeproteoglycan polysaccharide, is a major component67\n(Table\u00a0 4). When used alone, serum HA level has \nan AUROC of 0.87 for F2 fibrosis and 0.92 for cir\uffferhosis68. Other major components of the ECM include \nproteoglycans (such as heparan sulfate, chondroitin sul\ufffefate and keratan sulfate), collagen, elastin, fibronectin \nand laminin. Procollagen III amino-terminal peptide \n(PIIINP) in the serum is derived from the synthesis of \nnew type III collagen or from the degradation of exist\ufffeing type III collagen fibrils; PIIINP levels alone are not \na good diagnostic marker for liver fibrosis in NAFLD \nor alcoholic liver disease69. A neo-epitope-specific \ncompetitive ELISA for PIIINP, that is, Pro-C3, reflects \ntrue formation of type III collagen, as it measures the \npropeptide cleaved off from the intact collagen mol\ufffeecule and is specific for liver collagen70. Raised serum \nPro-C3 levels correlate with key components of NASH \nand fibrosis71.\nCirculating levels of tissue inhibitor of metallo\ufffeproteinases 1 (TIMP1), which regulates matrix \nmetalloproteinases and is responsible for the ECM \ncomposition and wound healing, reflect alterations in \ntissue matrix remodelling during hepatic fibrogenesis \nand fibrinolysis72. TIMP1 has excellent diagnostic \naccuracy (AUROC 0.97) to differentiate patients \nwho are obese and have NASH from age-matched \nhealthy control individuals73. Laminin is the most \nabundant non-collagenous glycoprotein in basement \nmembranes. Serum laminin level is able to diagnose \nfibrosis in patients with NAFLD to a satisfactory level \nof accuracy (AUROC 0.87)74. Although the biomarkers \ndiscussed in this section are promising, their cost and \navailability have limited their adoption in routine \npractice.\nTable 3 | Noninvasive tests of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis\nTest Description Accuracy Reproducibility Responsiveness Feasibility Limitations\nAST:ALT ratio AST and ALT AUROC 0.66\u20130.74 \nfor F3 fibrosis \n(Sn 40%, Sp 80%)",

Pediatric patients in which normal level of hs-cTnI is still on debate were\nexcluded to use 99th percentile cut-off value of new-generation hs-cTnI [20].\nConsidering shortage of organ availability, screening high-risk candidates for LT is in\ufffecreasingly more important. The MELD score has traditionally been accepted as the standard\nmethod for organ allocation for LT and preoperative sodium level has also been suggested\nalong with MELD score (MELD-Na) to improve accuracy of survival prediction [21,22]. Peri\ufffeoperative risk due to severe hemodynamic change during LT has led to the development of a\nvariety of scoring systems for cardiac risk stratification in the last decade. There still remain\nwide variations in the center specific protocols [23]. Use of hs-cTnI assay as a test for risk strat\ufffeification requires only a single and relatively inexpensive blood test which is widely available\nand routinely performed in many institutes. A clearly defined \u2018cut-off point\u2019, such as 0.04 ng/\nmL according to 99th percentile reference limit would be simple to use in a clinical setting\nwithout the difficulties in applying complex scoring systems to individual patients nor poten\ufffetial for subjective interpretation of clinical parameters. By integrating with preoperative evalu\ufffeation, more caution could be used even before the transplantation procedure in those with\nexpected adverse outcome related to cardiac and non-cardiac conditions.\nThis study has advantages over previous studies. To focus on hs-cTnI elevation caused by\nother than ischemic etiology, patients with history of heart disease was excluded and overall\nmortality was analyzed as a primary endpoint. By this means, predictive value of hs-cTnI in LT\nmay be widened beyond cardiac morbidity. IPW analysis was used to minimize biased esti\ufffemates. The use of IPW has rapidly increased in recent years [11].\nThe limitations of this study include the nature of non-randomized and observational study\nwhich could have significantly affected the results due to confounding factors. Although an\nIPW analysis was performed to adjust for these potential confounding factors, unmeasured\nvariables were not able to be corrected. Considering that rise or fall in serial hs-cTnI levels is a\ncritical component of diagnosis, an absolute level of hs-cTnI in this study might be insufficient.\nAnother limitation is that this study was a single center study in Asia. Most of recipients were\nAsians except two recipients from Middle East. Ethnic difference of normal hs-cTnI level\nwhich might have affected the results was not included in this analysis due to small number\n[24]. Despite of these, by evaluating influence of preoperative hs-cTnI, this study may be help\ufffeful in risk assessment and prediction of prognosis in LT recipients. A further study is required\nto determine whether delaying LT in patients with elevated hs-cTnI is necessary.\nConclusion\nPreoperative hs-cTnI is strongly associated with postoperative mortality after LT within 1-year\nfollow-up. Further study referring perioperative hs-cTnI level and its kinetics is required.\nSupporting information\nS1 Table.

All\nstudies recruited consecutive patients over a specified time\nperiod, thereby reducing the risk of selection bias.\nAssociation between Pre-Transplant MELD Score and\nPost-Transplantation Survival\nOf the 37 studies, 15 found no association between pre\ufffetransplant MELD score and post-transplant patient survival,\nwhile 22 reported poorer survival with higher MELD. A detailed\ndescription of the results of each study is presented in Table C\nin File S1. Based on qualitative analyses, there were no clear\ndifferences in studies with statistically significant findings\ncompared to those with no statistically significant findings. In\nboth groups, sample sizes varied, as did follow-up times.\nHowever, findings from the two largest studies (N >15,000)\nboth suggested that survival decreased with increasing MELD.\nOne observed this relationship only when patients with MELD\nscores under 9 were compared to those with scores of 30 or\ngreater, while the other had treated MELD as a continuous\nvariable. At the same time, of the 7 other studies that analysed\nMELD as a continuous variable, all but one found no\nstatistically significant association between MELD and survival.\nIn most of the studies, information presented on patient\ncharacteristics was limited. Therefore, it was not possible to\nidentify any differences in patient populations that could explain\ninconsistencies in the findings.\nPredictive ability of MELD score for post\ufffetransplantation survival\nEleven studies presented a receiver operating characteristic\n(ROC) curve to determine the predictive ability of pre-transplant\nMELD score to determine post-transplantation survival. The\narea under the curve is used to produce a concordance value\ncalled the c-statistic. A c-statistic of 0.50 indicates no predictive\nability, and is expected if the results are due to chance alone.\nIn contrast, a c-statistic of 1 represents perfect discrimination.\nValues under 0.7 suggest poor predictive power, while those\ngreater than 0.70 indicate a useful test, and those higher than\n0.80 imply excellent predictive accuracy[2]. Among the 11\nstudies, 10 reported c-statistics less than <0.7, indicating that\nMELD poorly predicted post-transplant survival. This included\nthe largest study contributing to the review[6]. In 1 study, the c\ufffestatistic decreased over time, from 0.711 for 3-month post\ufffetransplant survival to 0.679 for 12-month survival[8]. In the\nsingle study with a high c-statistic[9], there was no clear\ndifference in sample size, follow-up time, or patient population\nwhen compared to the studies with lower values.\nDiscussion\nThis review assessed the association and predictive ability of\npre-transplantation MELD score on post-transplantation\nsurvival in adults with end-stage liver disease. It highlighted\ndiscrepancies in findings across studies. Such discrepancies\nmay be related to the nature of the studies, The vast majority\nwere retrospective case series that relied upon exploratory\nstratified analyses of data to detect a relationship between\nMELD and post-transplant survival. As such, analytical\ntechniques, rather than study design, were used to control for\nconfounding. In addition, most of the studies were single\ncentered, with each site having its own process for prioritizing\npatients for transplant. Therefore, patients constituting the\ngeneral transplant population may have varied across studies.\nThus, while using pre-transplant MELD to predict post\ufffetransplant survival in transplant candidates may be attractive,\nthere is little evidence to support it. Prospective studies\ndesigned specifically to examine this relationship are needed.\nMELD score does appear to have a greater impact on mortality\nwhen observed in combination with other known risk factors for\npost-transplant mortality, including sub-optimal livers, low graft\ufffeto-body ratio and presence of Hepatitis C.

        "text": "patients with pretransplant serum creatinine levels of 0\u20130.99\nmg/dL, 1.0\u20131.99 mg/dL, and >2.0 mg/dL respectively. Corre\ufffesponding survivals were 63.9% in patients who required RRT at\nthe time of deceased donor LTA and 69.6% in those who under\ufffewent SLK transplantation. Patients requiring RRT preopera\ufffetively had better survival with SLK transplantation compared\nto deceased donor LTA. Because of the impact of renal function\non postliver transplant survival, serum creatinine was included\nas a variable in the MELD scoring system.\nMELD, postMELD era and need for SLK policy\nMELD was developed to estimate the mortality in patients\nwaiting for liver transplantation and to allocate organs to the\nsicker patients who would gain the most benefit from trans\ufffeplantation. The components of MELD score include the interna\ufffetional normalized ratio, serum bilirubin and serum creatinine.\nThe Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN)/\nUNOS adopted the MELD scoring system in February 2002 to\nfacilitate liver allograft allocation to wait-listed patients based\non medical necessity in compliance with OPTN\u2019s \u201cFinal Rule\u201d,\nwhich states that \u201callocation policies must be based on sound\nmedical judgment and standardized criteria, must seek to\nachieve the best use of organs and must avoid futile trans\ufffeplants\u201d. Since MELD score heavily weighs serum creatinine, it\nhas led to an increased number of patients with severe renal\ndysfunction and on RRT to undergo liver transplantation.\nAn unintended consequence of the introduction of MELD\nscoring for liver allocation in 2002 was a steady increase in SLK\ntransplantation, from 135 in 2000 to 731 in 2016 nationally, as\nshown in Fig. 1. The question regarding the benefits of SLK over\nLTA in patients with renal dysfunction then arises. Multiple\nsingle-center studies and registry analyses aimed to address\nthe added benefits of the addition of a kidney transplant to\nliver transplant candidates with renal dysfunction have shown\nvariable results.4,10,11 A matched-control analysis by Locke\net al.10 utilizing the UNOS database in 2008 failed to show\nbenefit of SLK transplantation over LTA despite using higher\nquality allografts for SLK transplantation. This could likely be\nrelated to the fact that kidney grafts were allocated to sicker\nrecipients, often with AKI, who probably developed multiorgan\ndisease processes that were too advanced to benefit from\neither mode of transplantation. A subgroup analysis suggested\npatient and liver allograft survival benefits for those SLK recip\ufffeients who were on dialysis for more than 3 months prior to\ntransplantation as compared to LTA.10 Another study by\nGonwa et al.3 comparing the patient survival between SLK\nand LTA revealed that patients on RRT at the time of liver trans\ufffeplantation do better with SLK than LTA.\nA recent review of the literature and OPTN database\nanalysis regarding recipient survival with or without renal\ndysfunction after SLK transplantation by Formica et al.4\nshowed that 37% of SLK recipients received no dialysis prior\nto transplantation and out of those who received no dialysis,\n40% had creatinine <2.5 mg/dL at time of transplantation.\nThe authors also illustrated that liver transplant candidates\nwith renal failure (defined by pretransplant dialysis time of\n>2 months or serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dL) benefited from\nSLK transplantation compared to LTA. However, the outcomes\nwith SLK were inferior compared to those of LTA in patients\nwithout renal dysfunction. A propensity score matched study\ncomparing 1884 SLK recipients with 31,882 LTA recipients trans\ufffeplanted from 2002 to 2009 showed a small survival benefit of\n3.7 months at 5 years in patients with pretransplant nondialysis\ufffedependent CKD who underwent SLK compared to LTA.12 The\nconsensus finding from the registry studies is that SLK is\nbeneficial for those liver transplant candidates with marked\nrenal dysfunction, or for those who have been on prolonged\npretransplant dialysis.3,4,11",

After those dates, \nthe Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) began \nto be used and changed the listing criteria. \nMELD was first described in 2000, with the aim \nto predict 3-month survival rates among patients \nundergoing transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic \nshunts (TIPS)(5,6)\n.\n Application of the MELD criteria to \nliver transplantation changed the allocation procedure \nfrom a waiting time-based to a risk-based system that \nconsiders the following variables: serum creatinine, \nbilirubin level, International Normalized Ratio (INR), \nand whether or not dialysis is required. \nSince then, MELD scores have been used to identify \npotential recipients with higher death risk. Priority is \ngiven to high MELD score individuals as an attempt to \ndecrease the mortality of patients on the waiting list for \nOLT. \nAs for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), \nan adjusted MELD score is established according to \ntumor staging, in which a MELD score of 24 corresponds \nto T1, and of 29 to T2. For these patients, the adjusted \nMELD is necessary because of the risk of these patients \nbeing eliminated from the list due to tumor progression \nor metastasis(7)\n.\n Thus, these patients usually present \nwith MELD scores < 30. \nWhile some authors showed that a high pre\ufffetransplant MELD score may work as a predictor of \npostoperative complications(8,9)\n,\n others found no correlation \nbetween the MELD score and patient outcome after \ntransplantation(10-13). Therefore, despite the benefits of \nthe MELD score system, investigators who adopt it as the \nmain criterion for OLT must be aware of its limitations, \nwhich still impose the need for refinement. \nSome researchers(9,14) consider 25 as a high MELD \nscore, while our group(15) and others(13) put the boundary \nat 30 or higher. As shown in other studies, successful \nOLT can be performed in patients presenting both high \n(MELD > 30) and low scores (MELD < 30)(15).\nImprovements in outcomes following OLT increased \nlong-term patient survival, which allowed identifying \nsome long-term post-transplant complications. Chronic \nkidney disease (CKD) is one of these complications \nassociated with decreased long-term patient survival, \nand a common one following liver transplant(16-20). CKD \nis classified according to its severity and the treatment \nrequired, and disease progression can lead to a severe \nrenal insufficiency that requires renal transplantation(21).\nImmunosuppressive drugs are nephrotoxic and \ntherefore require careful pretransplant evaluation of \nrenal function and close follow-up after OLT. Recent \nreports have described successful 1-year graft and \npatient survival rates (around 90%) with administration \nof low doses of immunosuppressors(22,23).\nIn high-MELD-score patients (range \u2265 30), impaired \nrenal function due to a hepatorenal syndrome or to \nnephropathy secondary to other diseases is usually \npresent as well. Although it has been suggested that \nOLT in these patients may compromise the success of \nthe procedure and lead to higher costs due to extra \nrequirements for blood transfusions, hemodialysis, and \nlonger stays in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or in the \nhospital(19), researchers have reached no consensus. \nOfficial data from the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, on \npatients awaiting OLT reveal that their average MELD \nscore is 29. Such score may already be considered high \nfor OLT, and is a consequence of the long waiting \nperiod on the OLT list because of insufficient deceased \ndonors(15) and lack of transplant centers in some areas. \nIn the United States, data from the UNOS suggest that",
