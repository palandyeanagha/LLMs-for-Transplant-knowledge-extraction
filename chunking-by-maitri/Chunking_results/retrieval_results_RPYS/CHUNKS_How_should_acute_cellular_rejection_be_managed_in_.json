The\nremaining recipient underwent liver retransplantation after 7.7\nyears of IS withdrawal for viral hepatitis. In addition, 6 recipients\nwere shown to have systemic chimerism (13).\nOver nearly three decades, many liver transplant centers\nhave conducted clinical trials of IS withdrawal in both adult\nand pediatric liver transplant recipients. It has been reported\nthat normal liver function was successfully maintained in adult\nand child liver transplant recipients, with \u223c20% of patients\n(6\u201363%) achieving complete immunosuppressive withdrawal\n(Tables 1, 2) (14\u201333).\nSanchez-Fueyo et al. of the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona\nconducted a prospective and multicenter IS withdrawal clinical\ntrial in 98 liver transplant recipients (NCT00647283). Of these,\n41 achieved clinical tolerance (41.8%) and 57 developed mild\nrejection (58.2%), which was followed by remission within 5.6\nmonths. During the 3-year follow-up after IS withdrawal, no\nsignificant histological damage was found in liver biopsies of the\ntolerant recipients. Statistical analysis showed that years post\ufffetransplantation correlated positively with tolerance induction\nand could be the strongest predictor (27).\nComparing with calcineurin inhibitors (CNI), sirolimus,\na kind of rapamycin inhibitor (mTOR-I), has no significant\ndrug toxicity, such as nephrotoxicity, hypertension, diabetes,\ninfections and neoplasms (34). Another advantage of sirolimus\nis its immunomodulatory ability that could facilitate safe IS\nwithdrawal (35). To assess if sirolimus could increase the\ntolerability in liver transplant recipients, Levitsky et al., at\nNorthwestern University, performed a prospective clinical trial\nof single sirolimus withdrawal (NCT02062944). They recruited\n15 recipients with non-viral or immunological hepatitis more\nthan 3 years after liver transplantation. After 12 months from\nsirolimus withdraw, it showed that 8 recipients (53%) achieved\nOT. Of the other 7 patients, 3 failed IS withdrawal, 3 developed\nmoderate cellular rejection (TCMR) on liver biopsies at the end\nof the study, and 1 was withdrawn from the trial owing to\nadrenal metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (32). The current\nresult showed the OT rate of sirolimus was comparable to CNI\ufffewithdrawal studies. Except for free CNI toxicity, whether liver\nrecipients can benefit more from sirolimus withdrawal, it still\nneeds more and larger trials.\nFor pediatric liver transplant recipients, Feng et al. in the\nUniversity of California conducted a multicenter, prospective\nclinical trial of IS withdrawal (WISP-R, NCT00320606). A total\nof 12 (60%) of the 20 enrolled pediatric recipients achieved\nclinical tolerance, and during follow-up for more than 2 years\nafter IS withdrawal, the graft function was normal and there\nwas no significant change in biopsy compared with baseline.\nA total of 3 recipients underwent acute rejection (n = 2) or\nuncertain rejection (n = 1) during IS withdrawal, and 4 recipients\nfailed to achieve clinical tolerance owing to uncertain acute\nrejection within 1 year of drug withdrawal.

Conservative therapy and discontinuation \nof the offending drugs are currently recommended. However, both \nmorbidity from HCV reactivation and the disadvantages of immu\ufffenosuppressive drug discontinuation should be taken into account, \nand decisions should be individualized. Further studies are needed \nto explore whether DAAs might have a benefit in preventing and \ntreating HCV reactivation during immunosuppressive treatment or \ncytotoxic chemotherapy.\nChildren\nIn a Korean study involving 2,080 6 to 11 year-old children in \n1996, the anti-HCV-antibody positive rate was 0.82%.214 The \ntransfusion of infected blood components or vertical transmission \nis the most common cause of HCV infection in children,215 al\ufffethough transfusion-related HCV transmission has been rarely re\ufffeported since the introduction of screening for HCV infection in \n1991 in South Korea. The global HCV infection rate among preg\ufffenant women has been reported to be 0.49\u20131.7%.216,217 A Korean \nstudy involving 5,000 pregnant women and another study with \n20,000 pregnant women reported anti-HCV-antibody positivity \nrates of 0.42\u20130.44%, with 57\u201360% of anti-HCV positive preg\ufffenant women also positive for HCV RNA.218,219\nThe frequency of HCV transmission was reported to be 1\u20136.2% \nduring the perinatal period,157,220 and the evidence that Cesarean \nsection reduces the risk of vertical HCV transmission is weak.221 \nAlthough HCV RNA has been detected in human milk, the acqui\ufffesition of HCV infection from human milk has not been document\ufffeed. Horizontal infections among children are rare, so there is no \nneed to limit routine activities, such as school life or exercise.221\nAn anti-HCV assay in children is recommended after 18 months \nof age because maternal antibodies can be delivered to new\ufffeborns.221,222 An HCV RNA assay can be performed at 1 or 2 \nmonths of age if earlier diagnosis is desired, although the sensitiv\ufffeity is as low as 22% at that time; therefore, HCV RNA assays \nshould be conducted at an age older than 6 months, when the \nsensitivity reaches 85%.222,223\nSpontaneous recovery is more frequent in children than in \nadults and tends to show a normal ALT level.224 In addition, HCV \ninfection in children often shows slow progression of hepatic fi\ufffebrosis and only rarely results in severe hepatic damage. However, \naggressive treatment during childhood has been suggested be\ufffecause children usually have a regular lifestyle and show higher \ntherapeutic compliance than adults.

        "text": "T Cell Response in Acute HCV Infection 713\nstudy was focused on the peripheral blood compartment which\nmay only partially reflect immune events occurring within the\ninfected liver (12) where HCV-specific T cells may be prefer\ufffeentially present at the acute stage of infection. Therefore, the\nalternative possibility that weaker peripheral blood T cell re\ufffesponses associated with chronic evolution are caused by persis\ufffetent sequestration of HCV-specific T cells within the liver as a\nresult of continuous viral replication and antigen presentation\ncannot be completely ruled out at present. However, it is of\nnote that the T cell response of the patients who normalized\nALT was significantly stronger already at the early stages of\ndisease (Fig. 3) when both groups of patients had similarly ele\ufffevated transaminase levels, as expression of acute hepatitis with\ncellular recruitment within their livers. This finding strongly\nsuggests that the overall anti-viral immune response was actu\ufffeally more efficient in patients who ultimately succeeded in\nresolving the disease. Unfortunately, this issue cannot be di\uffferectly addressed because ethical reasons preclude the possibil\ufffeity of obtaining liver tissue from patients with acute HCV in\ufffefection.\nAn additional factor to take into account in the interpreta\ufffetion of the results of our study is the genotype of the infecting\nvirus. In fact, more than 50% of the patients with persistent\nliver cell injury were infected by genotype 2a or 3a, whereas\nthe HCV proteins used to stimulate their T cell responses were\nderived from genotype 1, which is the prevalent genotype de\ufffetected among recovered patients. Thus, the strength of the\nT cell response may have been influenced by the degree of ho\ufffemology between the sequence of the infecting virus and that of\nthe proteins used to stimulate in vitro the T cell response. This\ninterpretation is however contradicted by the evidence that the\nT cell response in genotype 1\u2013infected patients with persis\ufffetently elevated ALT was not stronger than in the patients of\nthe same group infected by other genotypes (genotypes 2 and\n3) (data not shown). Moreover, two additional lines of obser\ufffevations argue against this interpretation. First, E2 was the most\nfrequently recognized protein by T cells of patients with persis\ufffetently elevated ALT, even though the variability of this region\nis the highest among different genotypes. Second, a highly sig\ufffenificant difference between groups was also observed with re\ufffespect to T cell responses to HCV core which is the most con\ufffeserved HCV antigen. Significant T cell responses observed in\nacutely infected patients with persistent liver damage (like\nthose described in the present study) were less frequently de\ufffetectable and less vigorous than the responses previously re\ufffeported in patients with long lasting chronic HCV infections\n(10, 13). This suggests that T cell responsiveness to HCV pro\ufffeteins in the peripheral blood compartment may progressively\nincrease as a function of the time of infection. This may be due\neither to progressive induction of responses to subdominant\nepitopes as a result of continuous presentation of viral antigens\n(22) or to a different compartmentalization of T cells in differ\ufffeent stages of infection or to recovery of the T cell function af\ufffeter an early stage of T cell hyporesponsiveness. Alternatively,\nthe different strength of responses may reflect different epide\ufffemiological and virological features of the populations of pa\ufffetients selected in different studies. While patients with a his\ufffetory of drug addiction were included in this longitudinal study\nof acute HCV infection, most of the data previously reported\nin chronic hepatitis C came from infections of posttransfu\ufffesional or sporadic origin less frequently related to drug addic\ufffetion (10, 13).\nIn conclusion, our study suggests that the relative strength\nof the T cell response to HCV proteins in the acute phase of\nhepatitis C may represent a critical determinant of the final",

In this follow-up study, on the first published cohort of post-liver\ntransplant patients treated with telaprevir-based triple therapy, we investigated both efficacy and safety data in follow\ufffeup to 24 weeks (SVR 24) after end of treatment (EOT). SVR 24 efficacy and safety data from 9 liver transplant HCV\npatients being treated with telaprevir, pegylated interferon, and ribavirin, showed 5 of the transplanted patients\naccomplished the full duration of the 48 week triple therapy.\nNotable were the 4 patients found to be HCV RNA-negative at week 4, and 8 patients at week 12. Upon EOT, at\nweek 48, 6 patients were HCV RNA-negative. Importantly, at follow-up (24 weeks after EOT), a favorable sustained\nvirological response rate was observed in 5 of these patients with HCV RNA remaining negative, including in one\npatient who discontinued treatment prematurely. Due to side effects, 2 patients discontinued, 2 suffered from\nvirological breakthrough after the telaprevir treatment phase, and 1 patient had a relapse after EOT. Two thirds of\npatients exhibited hematological side effects requiring ribavirin dose reductions, administration of erythropoetin, or\neven blood transfusions.\nThis retrospective analysis provides evidence that - with respect to SVR 24 - liver transplant patients suffering from\nHCV genotype 1 recurrence may benefit from a telaprevir-based triple therapy as this new regimen showed\nacceptable antiviral efficacy in this small cohort of mostly pre-treated patients. Management of drug-drug interactions\nis challenging, but feasible. In part severe side effects are frequent during treatment and require therapeutic\ninterventions.\nCitation: Werner CR, Egetemeyr DP, Lauer UM, Nadalin S, K\u00f6nigsrainer A, et al.

Lilleri et al.\n| 254 | haematologica | 2008; 93(2)\nallow robust conclusions to be drawn, it was found that\nHCMV-specific T-cell reconstitution occurred in all surviv\ufffeing HCMV-positive recipients while about 40% of nega\ufffetive recipients did not develop HCMV-specific T-cell\nimmunity or infection within the 12 months after their\ntransplant. This conclusion is in keeping with previous\nreports suggesting that recipient HCMV infection may act\nas a booster for antigen-experienced T cells transferred\nwith the graft.18,29,30 However, since two HCMV-negative\nrecipients developed HCMV-specific immune reconstitu\ufffetion in the absence of detectable viral infection in blood,\nan antigen-independent, cytokine-driven expansion of\ndonor memory T cells transferred with the graft could be\ntaken into consideration as an inducer of immune recon\ufffestitution in a minority of cases,31-33 unless episodes of\nHCMV infection at sites other than blood may have con\ufffetributed to the virus-specific immune reconstitution.\nThese findings are in agreement with those of a previ\ufffeous study conducted on children receiving HSCT, in\nwhich it was possible to examine a higher proportion of\nHCMV-negative recipients, and reactivation of latent virus\nwas identified as the main factor leading to immune\nreconstitution.18 In pediatric patients, the presence of\ndonor\u2019s memory T cells in the graft did not seem to have\na major influence on the kinetics and magnitude of\nimmune reconstitution. In fact, children receiving a graft\nfrom a seronegative donor or a T-cell-depleted graft did\nnot show a delay in HCMV-specific T-cell reconstitution.\nConversely, in the present study, it was observed that\nadult patients receiving a transplant from an HCMV-neg\ufffeative donor reconstituted HCMV-specific T-cells signifi\ufffecantly later than those receiving a graft from a positive\ndonor. This finding, in keeping with reports indicating a\nbetter control of HCMV infection34 and reduced trans\ufffeplant-related mortality35 in adult patients receiving a graft\nfrom a positive donor, supports a major role for donor\ufffederived memory T cells in accelerating immune reconsti\ufffetution in adults. It can be hypothesized that children,\ngiven their still active thymic function, have a better\ncapacity to develop an anti-HCMV primary immune\nresponse in the absence of antigen-experienced T cells in\nthe graft. It is known that, in young children, recovery of\nna\u00efve CD4+ T cells is rapid after chemotherapy,36 whereas\nin adults, following thymus atrophy, it is limited and\ndelayed.37 These data may provide a reasonable explana\ufffetion for the well-known fact that the capacity to control\ninfections is less in adults than in children.\nAmong other factors potentially influencing immune\nreconstitution, only the use of peripheral blood as the\nsource of stem cells was found to be significantly correlat\ufffeed with an earlier recovery of HCMV-specific CD4+ T\ncells. This may be due to the higher number of memory T\ncells in peripheral blood than in bone marrow, leading to\nan earlier HCMV-specific CD4+ T-cell reconstitution.38 In\nthis respect, CD8+ T cells are less influenced, possibly\nbecause they are able to undergo more rapid and massive\nexpansion with respect to CD4+ T cells, in response to\nHCMV stimulation. The magnitude of the reconstituted\nHCMV-specific CD8+ T cell pool exceeded that of CD4+ T\ncells, and a much higher number of virus-specific CD8+ T\ncells than that observed in healthy controls (reaching even\nlevels >30% of the total CD8+ T cells) accumulated and\npersisted in peripheral blood. Despite the difference in\nmagnitude, data from this study confirm that the kinetics\nof HCMV-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell reconstitution\nare similar39 (with a median time to immune reconstitu\ufffetion of about 2 months), with CD8+ appearing slightly ear\ufffelier than CD4+ T cells. This is different from what has\nbeen observed in organ transplant recipients in whom",
