With the availability of noninterferon\ufffebased therapy, eliminating HCV may be achievable in LT recip\ufffeients. Methods: We studied all consecutive recipients who\nunderwent LT at the University of California Los Angeles be\ufffetween January 2005 and June 2017. We collected data on date\nof transplant and last follow-up, as well as laboratory values. We\nalso recorded type and timing of antiviral therapy relative to LT.\nAnalyses were performed to assess the proportion of LT recipi\ufffeents who are viremic after transplant. Results: Six hundred\nthirty-four patients underwent LT with a diagnosis of HCV. There\nwas a statistically significant trend for patients to be cured be\ufffefore (p < 0.001) and after liver transplantation (p < 0.001) for\nthe study period of 2014 to 2016 relative to 2005 and 2013,\nrespectively. Of the 634 recipients eligible for therapy, 8% and\n74% were treated within 12 months of transplant for the study\nperiods 2005 to 2013 and 2014 to 2016, respectively. There\nwas a significant decrease between the two study periods in\nthe proportion of patients undergoing re-LT 1 year after the\noriginal LT: 5.5% (n = 28/510) and 1.5% (n = 2/124) respec\ufffetively for study periods 2005 to 2013 and 2014 to 2016 respec\ufffetively (p = 0.011). Conclusions: The proportion of LT recipients\nwho are viremic has decreased over time. Eliminating HCV in LT\nrecipients is feasible after the introduction of direct-acting\nagents. Curing HCV should translate to improved clinical out\ufffecomes in LT recipients who were transplanted for HCV infection\nwith longer follow-up. Preliminary results suggest the de\ufffecreased need for transplant in the direct-acting agents era.\nCitation of this article: Saab S, Challita Y, Chen PH, Jimenez\nMA, Lee AD, Saab EG, et al.

Cumulative studies show that DAA therapy renders high cure efficiency (>90%) and good safety \nprofile, and may even bring some unexpected benefits to the patients. However, some issues of concern \narise, one of which is the resistance mutation of HCV genome leading to failure of treatment. With the \naim of providing some meaningful references for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC), this article \nsummarizes the research progress on benefits of DAA accompanied by viral clearance in the treatment of \nchronic hepatitis and the drug resistance.\nKey words: hepatitis C virus (HCV), direct acting antiviral (DAA), sustained virological response (SVR), \nresistance-associated substitutions (RAS)\nIntroduction\nHepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global \nepidemic. According to the World Health Organiza\ufffetion (WHO), approximately 71 million people are \ncurrently living with hepatitis C virus worldwide, \nwhich is the main cause of chronic hepatitis. The \nnumber of death from hepatitis C-related liver disease \nhas exceeded 399 000 yearly [1]. Nowadays, it is well \nrecognized that chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is a major \npublic health problem that can contribute to liver \nfibrosis, progressive decline in liver function, and \nultimately death in patients [1, 2].\nAs an infectious agent with high sequence \nvariations, HCV is classified into seven genotypes \n(GT) and is further subdivided into nearly 100 \nsubtypes to date. It is recognized that HCV genotypes \nhave a regionally distinct global distribution: HCV \nGT1 (46.2%) and 3 (30.1%) dominate the global \ninfections; GT 2, 4, and 6 are responsible for \napproximately 22.8% of HCV infections; GT 5 \naccounts for the remaining less than 1%; GT 7 has \nbeen identified so far in very few patients originating \nfrom Central Africa [3]. \nIn the past two decades, the only standard \ntreatment for patients with HCV infection is \npeg-interferon plus ribavirin (PegIFN/RBV) in 24 to \n72 weeks, but only a limited proportion of patients \ncan achieve a sustained virological response (SVR), \ndefined as HCV RNA continues to be undetectable in \nserum at 12 weeks after completing treatment. What is \nworse, the interferon-based agent can cause many \nadverse effects in more than 10% of patients during \nand after the treatment [4], such as depression, \ncytoreduction and hemolytic anemia [5]. Fortunately, \nas DAA drugs have been developed rapidly and used \nin the clinical application, the cure rate of chronic \nhepatitis C has a revolutionary improvement even in \npatients with liver cirrhosis, and the efficiency persists \nto rise from the first generation to the third generation \nDAA drugs [6].\nIn general, DAAs can be divided into three major \nclasses based on their targets in HCV proteins: the \nnonstructural protein 3/4A (NS3/4A) protease \ninhibitors (PIs) that can inhibit HCV polyprotein",

The decline was even greater for hep\ufffeatitis C without associated HCC (S4 Table). The declining numbers and proportions of liver\ntransplants for liver disease and HCC associated with hepatitis C is in concordance with the\nreports of a similar decrease in proportion of patients with hepatitis C enrolled on the liver\ntransplant waitlist [5]. This decline in liver transplant for hepatitis C complication is contem\ufffeporaneously associated with increased screening and the introduction of the highly effective,\ncurative direct acting antiviral therapies for hepatitis C [6]. There was also a decrease in the\nproportion of liver transplants for liver disease and HCC related to hepatitis B between 2010\nand 2019. This may, likewise, be attributed to antiviral therapy and screening programs for\nchronic hepatitis B.\nWith the decline in liver transplants for HCV, the proportion of liver transplants for liver\ndisease and HCC associated with NAFLD has more than doubled from 7.6% to 18.5% in men,\nand from 11.9% to 26.8% in women between 2010 and 2019. In 2017, NAFLD surpassed hepa\ufffetitis C as the leading etiology of liver disease among women who received liver transplants and\nremained the third most common etiology of liver disease among men who received liver\ntransplants. The increase in liver transplant for NAFLD is associated with a growing obesity\ncrisis [6]. Between 2010 and 2019, proportion of male transplant recipients who were severely\nobese (BMI \ufffd 35) increased from 12.4% to 15.7%, and from 16.5% to 18.4% in women. Past\nstudies have suggested that many transplant recipients with cryptogenic cirrhosis may repre\ufffesent uncounted cases of NAFLD [9, 10] and should be included as a part of the NAFLD cohort.\nWe found among the 259 (3.1% of total) transplants for cryptogenic cirrhosis in 2019, only 32\n(12.4%) recipients had a BMI \ufffd 35, and among the 145 (1.7% of total) transplants with unspec\ufffeified liver disease, only 6 (4.1%) had a BMI \ufffd 35. Therefore, they would be unlikely contribute\nto a significant increase in cases of NAFLD. Liver transplants for liver disease and HCC associ\ufffeated with NAFLD will likely continue to grow as a result of the high prevalence of severe and\nmorbid obesity in the U.S. population.

It is mainly\ntransmitted by the parenteral route. However, although with lower efficiency, it may be also transmitted by sexual\nintercourses and by the mother-to-child route. Epidemiological evidence shows that a wave of infection occurred\nin the 1945-65 period (baby boomers) in western countries. After acute infection, as many as 50-85% of the\npatients fail to clear the virus resulting in chronic liver infection and/or disease. It is estimated that, on a global\nscale, about 170 million people are chronically infected with HCV, leading to about 350.000 deaths yearly. Among\nwestern countries southern Europe, and particularly Italy, is among the most affected areas. The impact on the\npublic health systems is noteworthy, with high number of hospitalizations due to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis or\nhepatocellular carcinoma. While waiting for a safe and effective vaccine to be made available, new promising\ndirect-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs offer a better therapeutic scenario than in the past even for the poor responder\ngenotypes 1 and 4, provided that effective screening and care is offered. However, the long and aspecific\nprodromic period before clinical symptoms develop is a major obstacle to early detection and treatment. Effective\nscreening strategies may target at-risk groups or age specific groups, as recently recommended by the CDC.\nIntroduction\nThe hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a RNA virus belonging to\nthe Flaviviridae family. It has been first recognized as a\ncause of transfusion-associated acute and chronic hepatitis\n(formerly known as non-A, non-B hepatitis) in 1989 [1].\nSix different genotypes (HCV-1 to HCV-6) and several\nsubtypes have subsequently been identified, with different\ngeographical and virulence patterns and different response\nto conventional therapy. Its epidemiological relevance as a\ncause of chronic liver injury, with potential for neoplastic\ndegeneration, has since been fully appreciated. At present,\nit is estimated that about 170 million people, roughly 3%\nof the world population, are chronically infected with\nHCV leading to about 350.000 deaths yearly, related to\ncomplications such as cirrhosis and liver cancer [2].\nDuring the last 2 decades, an increasing body of knowl\ufffeedge has accumulated as to its virological properties,\nmodes of transmission, epidemiological characteristics,\npathogenesis, clinical features and public health impact.\nWhile waiting for a safe and effective vaccine to be made\navailable, new promising direct-acting antiviral (DAA)\ndrugs offer a better therapeutic scenario than in the past\neven for the poor responder genotypes 1 and 4.\nTransmission routes and epidemiology\nSimilarly to other parenterally-transmitted infections\nsuch as HIV and HBV, other various modalities of HCV\ntransmission have been documented:\n- Intravenous drug use.

In this follow-up study, on the first published cohort of post-liver\ntransplant patients treated with telaprevir-based triple therapy, we investigated both efficacy and safety data in follow\ufffeup to 24 weeks (SVR 24) after end of treatment (EOT). SVR 24 efficacy and safety data from 9 liver transplant HCV\npatients being treated with telaprevir, pegylated interferon, and ribavirin, showed 5 of the transplanted patients\naccomplished the full duration of the 48 week triple therapy.\nNotable were the 4 patients found to be HCV RNA-negative at week 4, and 8 patients at week 12. Upon EOT, at\nweek 48, 6 patients were HCV RNA-negative. Importantly, at follow-up (24 weeks after EOT), a favorable sustained\nvirological response rate was observed in 5 of these patients with HCV RNA remaining negative, including in one\npatient who discontinued treatment prematurely. Due to side effects, 2 patients discontinued, 2 suffered from\nvirological breakthrough after the telaprevir treatment phase, and 1 patient had a relapse after EOT. Two thirds of\npatients exhibited hematological side effects requiring ribavirin dose reductions, administration of erythropoetin, or\neven blood transfusions.\nThis retrospective analysis provides evidence that - with respect to SVR 24 - liver transplant patients suffering from\nHCV genotype 1 recurrence may benefit from a telaprevir-based triple therapy as this new regimen showed\nacceptable antiviral efficacy in this small cohort of mostly pre-treated patients.

A disease that was cured only in less than half of \npatients with a long therapy and with side effects is now a disease \nthat can be eradicated in 8-12 weeks, almost in all patients, \nwith all-oral interferon free regimens based on DAAs. Despite \nthis triumphal therapeutic event, HCV still is a global concern, \naffecting around 71 million people worldwide [1]. This epochal \ntherapeutic progress of HCV through DAAs has led to an \nimmense international interest for global elimination of HCV \nas a public health threat and to the ambitious decision of the \nWorld Health Organization (WHO) in 2016 to eliminate viral \nhepatitis by 2030 (90% reduction in incidence, treatment of 80% \npatients who are eligible and 65% reduction in mortality) [1].\nRomania is considered the country with the highest \nprevalence of HCV in Europe, with various reported figures \nin the last decades (5.9% in 1990, 3.23% in 2010, recently \nestimated 1.39%) [2-4]. Moldavia is a Romanian province with \nthe highest prevalence of HCV [3].\nTo fulfil the WHO targets each country should have its \nindividual plan as there is no \u201cone size-fits-all\u201d approach [5]. \nThus, several strategies have been proposed. One is micro\ufffeelimination, a concept that breaks down the national elimination \ngoals into smaller, easier to accomplish tasks such as specific \nsubpopulations (prisoners, people with haemophilia or HIV, \nhemodialysis, transplant recipients, people who inject drugs, men \nwho have sex with men) as well as geographical areas (regions, \ncities, villages). The community-based strategy combined \neducational campaign, testing and treatment [4]. We adopted \nsuch a strategy in a project designed to educate, test and treat \nHCV with the aim of eliminating HCV infection in all adults, in \na village named Vetrisoaia, located in Eastern Romania, in the \nMoldavia province, Vaslui county, a region considered as having \na poor socioeconomic level, with difficult access to healthcare \nsystem. A mobile team of gastroenterologists, residents and \nnurses from the Institute of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, \nSt. Spiridon Hospital Iasi was created and undertook community \nmobilization with the aid of the local leadership (mayor, village \ncouncil, general practitioners, teachers, priest). Our project was \ncarried out between 1st March 2019-31st December 2019. The adult \npopulation of Vetrisoaia, comprising 3,507 people were invited to \nbe tested by direct communication, house-to-house. For certain \nsituations, the screening was organized at a household level, this \nbeing one of the reasons for the high coverage of the village. \nThe screening was made using rapid diagnostic orientation \ntests: 2,945 (84%) subjects were tested and 78 (2.64%) were \nfound with positive HCV antibodies and were scheduled for \nfurther evaluation in our hospital, in order to be linked to care. \nOut of sixty-six (85%) presented for evaluation, 55 (83%) had \nHCV RNA detectable and 25% had advanced fibrosis (F3/F4). \nFifty-four (98%) completed antiviral treatment and 53 (99%) \nobtained sustained virological response (SVR). \nTo our knowledge this project is the first in Romania and \namong only a few in Europe. A similar project was performed \nin Egypt [6]. This proof-of-concept study could inspire similar \nprojects in Romania and other countries, which have a high \npercentage of rural populations. \nLaura Huiban1,2, Carol Stanciu1\n, Catalin Sfarti1,2, Cristina Muzica1,2, \nTudor Cuciureanu1,2, Sebastian Zenovia1,2, Georgiana Frunzuc2\n, \nIoana Damian2\n, Anca Trifan1,2",

Harvey J. Alter, Michael Houghton and Charles M. Rice were rewarded with Nobel Prize in\nPhysiology or Medicine for \u201cthe discovery of hepatitis C virus (HCV)\u201d. During the past 50 years, remarkable achievements\nhave been made in treatment of HCV infection: it has changed from being a life-threatening chronic disease to being\ncurable. In this commentary, we briefly summarized the milestone events in the \u201cscientific journey\u201d from the first report\nof non-A, non-B hepatitis and discovery of the pathogen (HCV) to final identification of efficacious direct-acting\nantivirals. Further, we address the challenges and unmet issues in this field.\nBackground\nThe 2020 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was\nawarded to Drs. Harvey J. Alter, Michael Houghton and\nCharles M. Rice for the discovery of hepatitis C virus\n(HCV). HCV is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA\nhepatophilic virus. In contrast to oral transmission of\nhepatitis A virus (HAV) and bodily fluids-mediated\ntransmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV), HCV is primar\ufffeily transmitted through blood transfusion and intraven\ufffeous drug use. After acute HCV infection, approximately\n75\u201385% of the patients develop chronic hepatitis C\n(CHC). Patients with CHC are prone to hepatic cirrho\ufffesis, chronic liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma\n[1]. HCV infects more than 170 million people world\ufffewide, and approximately 10 million in China [1, 2], and\nthus represents a huge healthcare and economic burden.\nDiscovery of HCV\nDiscovery of HCV began with the finding a novel type of\nhepatitis in patients who received blood transfusion [3]\n(Fig. 1). HAV and HBV were not present in such\npatients [4, 5]. Alter and colleagues coined the term\n\u201cnon-A, non-B hepatitis\u201d in 1975 [4]. They collected\nplasma/serum samples from a blood donor with chronic\nhepatitis and 4 people who developed \u201cnon-A, non-B\nhepatitis\u201d after receiving blood transfusion, and injected\nthese samples to 5 chimpanzees. As they suspected, all 5\nchimpanzees developed hepatitis, as evidenced by ele\ufffevated alanine aminotransferase as well as liver patho\ufffelogical changes, confirming the presence of a yet\nunknown transmissible agent in the blood of patients\nwith non-A, non-B hepatitis [6].\nIn 1989, Houghton and colleagues constructed a\nrandom-primed complementary DNA library using\nplasma samples from patients with non-A, non-B hepa\ufffetitis [7]. One clone in this library was not derived from\nhost DNA, and appeared to be from a novel RNA virus\nbelonging to the Flavivirus family (at least 10,000 nucle\ufffeotides and is positive-stranded) [7]. Houghton and col\ufffeleagues named this novel virus as HCV and reported a\ndiagnostic assay using yeast-expressed recombinant\npolypeptide based on HCV genome to capture viral anti\ufffebodies in the same journal that published the sequencing\ninformation [8].\nRice and colleagues later constructed a full-length\nclone of HCV complementary DNA that could tran\ufffescribe an infectious RNA variant of HCV [9]. Upon\nintrahepatic inoculation of this clone, chimpanzees\n\u00a9 The Author(s). 2020 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License,\nwhich permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give\nappropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if\nchanges were made.

Donors who\nshowed indeterminate results have been ex\ufffecluded from our calculations as there is ac\ufffecumulating evidence that such individuals are\nnon-infectious.45 Using this data and the num\ufffeber of donor exposures we predicted that one\nor two (1 8) patients within our group would\nbe HCV positive. It was assumed that 80% of\npatients receiving a unit of blood from a RIBA\npositive donor will become infected.4\nDiscussion\nThe prevalence of hepatitis C infection\namongst multitransfused patients with haem\ufffeatological malignancy is low in this study. This\nis in contrast to both a recent Italian study\nwhere 29% (44/102) of children treated for\nacute lymphoblastic leukaemia were found to\nbe hepatitis C positive6 and a Finnish study\nwhere 17% (12/71) of multitransfused adult\npatients with leukaemia were positive.7 The\ndifferences between countries seems to reflect\nthe differing prevalence of hepatitis C in the\nlocal donor population. The quoted prevalence\nin Italy being 1-3%8 and in Finland 0-106%.6\nThese are both significantly higher than the\nprevalence of 0-028% found in the West Mid\ufffelands. However, it is likely that the prevalence\nof hepatitis C carriage in blood donors was\nhigher before 1985 when measures were in\ufffetroduced to prevent transmission of HIV via\ntransfusion.9 The frequency of anti-HCV anti\ufffe231\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n.
