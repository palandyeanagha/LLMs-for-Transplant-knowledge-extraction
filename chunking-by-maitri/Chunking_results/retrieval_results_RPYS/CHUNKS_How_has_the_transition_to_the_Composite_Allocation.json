        "text": "loss due to chronic rejection was associated with HLA DSAs (24, \n164). Chronic rejection is also an important cause of late failure \nof vascularized CTA (165, 166). Similarly, chronic damage and TV \nin heart (25), lung (95, 167, 168), pancreas (169), and liver (11, 28, \n170) allografts are more common among patients with a history of \nbiopsy-proven AMR and HLA DSAs.\nOnly half of renal allografts were functioning within 18 \nmonths of diagnosis of chronic AMR (164). Median survival \ntime of lung allografts after diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliter\ufffeans syndrome (BOS) is less than 3 years (171). TV accounts for \none-third of cardiac allograft recipient deaths late after trans\ufffeplant (163). Therefore, chronic rejection culminating in TV is \ncurrently an irreversible process with significant impact on \npatient morbidity and mortality.\nChronic AMR occurs late (more than 1 year) after transplant \nbut exhibits many of the features characteristic of acute AMR in \neach organ, including endothelial cell changes, microvascular \ninflammation, C4d, and circulating donor-specific antibodies. In \naddition, fibrosis is an important characteristic of chronic AMR \n(31, 172). For example, transplant glomerulopathy is a feature of \nchronic AMR in renal allografts, with duplication of the basement \nmembrane in the glomerulus and peritubular capillaries (173).\nAllografts with TV suffer from neointimal expansion and \nfibrosis in the larger vessels, which is largely considered a mani\ufffefestation or consequence of chronic AMR. TV may be missed on \nroutine biopsy owing to its predominant involvement of larger \nvessels that are not often observed except on deep tissue sam\ufffeples. For example, in the heart, cardiac allograft vasculopathy \n(CAV) is detected by imaging such as intravascular ultrasound \nor histologically only upon explant. CAV appears as arterioscle\uffferotic lesions with inflammatory neointimal hyperplasia that can \nbe clearly distinguished from eccentric atherosclerotic plaques \n(25). Intimal thickening may be so severe as to fully occlude the \naffected vasculature. Similarly, arteriopathy of kidney trans\ufffeplants is a consequence of intimal fibrosis and expansion in the \nrenal arteries. An overview of the features of TV across organs \nand CTA is provided in Table 2.\nMechanisms and therapies. Although clinical evidence strong\ufffely supports the association between chronic AMR, TV, and HLA \nDSAs in numerous solid organs, the precise mechanisms by which \nneointimal proliferation and fibrosis occur are unclear. In part, \nthis is because it is difficult to model this process in vitro, and \nthere has been a historical lack of an appropriate animal model. \nMultiple other mechanisms contribute to TV, including chronic T \ncell\u2013mediated injury and viral and/or metabolic risk factors, but \nHLA antibodies are both a major risk factor and a probable caus\ufffeative agent for chronic vascular changes. Our group and others \nhave demonstrated in in vitro models that HLA antibodies trigger \nprosurvival and proliferative intracellular signaling via ERK and \nmTOR in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, promoting \ngrowth, cytoskeletal changes, and migration (131, 141\u2013147). Phos\ufffephorylation of these signaling molecules has been substantiated \nin AMR in both mouse and human allografts (102, 147, 148). HLA \nI antibodies also elicit matrix metalloprotease\u2013 and sphingolipid\ufffemediated signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells, which are \nthought to contribute to the intimal hyperplasia seen in TV (174,",

Neither \n30-day mortality or grade 3 primary graft dysfunction at \n72 h post-transplant (PGD3 at 72 h) were found to differ \nsignificantly between EVLP and standard cohorts.\nThe direction of primary and secondary outcomes of this \nmeta-analysis were found to be concordant with all included \nstudies, with the exception of the INSPIRE RCT, which \nidentified a significantly greater 30-day mortality in the \nEVLP group but also a significant reduction in PGD3 at \n72 h for EVLP patients. The authors of that study \naccounted for the significant 30-day mortality signal as non\ufffeEVLP related (due to iatrogenic surgical complications, \npatients\u2019 compliance with medications, and patients\u2019 cardiac \nrisk factors) and this led to that outcome\u2019s exclusion from \nthis meta-analysis (27). \nThe PaO2/FiO2 threshold for acceptance of donor grafts \nvaries between centres (22), as well as how this value is \nmeasured (for example, variations in time points, positive \nend expiratory pressure). However, this was not shown to \nsignificantly affect overall survival outcomes between EVLP \nand standard protocol lungs at a meta-analysis level, nor \nwithin included studies, which included donor lungs with \npre-EVLP pooled mean PaO2/FiO2 value of 272 mmHg \n[and as low as 150 mmHg (4)]. Collectively, this information \ncould be used to shape EVLP donor acceptance criteria \nand potentially further increase the number of donor lungs \naccepted for EVLP, for example from DCD donors, who \ntypically have worse PaO2 values (4,23,25). The divergent \nbut statistically non-significant survival curves evidenced \nwith the removal of the RCT (Figure S2) likely reflect the \nfact that the INSPIRE RCT made up a large proportion \nof the pooled EVLP cohort and required both EVLP and \nstandard donor groups to have similarly high PaO2/FiO2\nratios for acceptance. This was in contrast to the other \nincluded studies, where EVLP was used for reconditioning \ngrafts with poorer pre-EVLP PaO2/FiO2 ratios. \nPGD3 at 72 hours has been found to correlate with \nincreased 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year mortality (26,28), \nas well as chronic lung allograft dysfunction (27). While \nthe reduction in PGD3 at 72 h was only significant in the \nINSPIRE RCT, a reduced incidence of PGD3 at 72 h in \nEVLP transplant recipients was a finding shared by several \nother included studies (5,18,26). Though these studies\u2019 \nfindings on PGD3 did not reach significance and had \nsmaller cohorts than the RCT, they all noted an absence \nof PGD3 events in their EVLP recipients, and other non\ufffezero event studies similarly noted non-significant lower \nincidences. This was the case despite a worse PaO2/FiO2\nin the meta-analysis EVLP donor group and in individual \nstudies, where poorer PaO2/FiO2 donor lungs were accepted \nfor EVLP treatment. Unlike other included studies, the \nINSPIRE RCT was exceptional in its exclusion of donors \nwith PaO2/FiO2 <300 mmHg for both EVLP and standard \ngroups. Although PGD3 was a secondary outcome in \nthis meta-analysis, it\u2019s non-significant difference between \nEVLP and standard groups in combination with the non\ufffesignificant survival difference at follow-up is potentially",

Ann Cardiothorac Surg 2020;9(1):1-9 | http://dx.doi.org/10.21037/acs.2020.01.02\nthe real possibility of EVLP to reduce the number of lung \ntransplant wait-list deaths. Additionally, it adds weight to \nthe argument that satisfactory results can be obtained with \nmore than one EVLP protocol (22).\nThis meta-analysis is potentially limited by it being \nlargely comprised of institutional series, however, RCT in \nthis area are difficult since transplanting initially rejected \nor marginal (beyond extended criteria) donor lungs as \na control arm would be ethically difficult to justify (21). \nAlthough statistical heterogeneity was low in meta-analysis \nendpoints, it remained moderate to high for some baseline \nand intraoperative characteristics. This heterogeneity is \nlikely due to differences in centers\u2019 donor criteria and \noperative methods (for example, single versus double lung), \nand sensitivity analysis did not demonstrate an effect on \nsignificance of outcomes. This does not however, mean \nthat all sources of heterogeneity were able to be accounted \nfor and the authors acknowledge that even where I2\n point \nvalues were low, I2\n confidence intervals often still included \nat least moderate heterogeneity values (16). Additionally, \nmany studies were retrospective and included a range of \nrecruitment years and recruitment period lengths. As EVLP \nmethodology and knowledge (and lung transplant more \nbroadly) is a rapidly-evolving field, this may have introduced \nsome learning-curve type confounding effect (25).\nConclusions\nAggregated patient survival data analysis of EVLP \nand standard/cold-storage lung transplant recipients \ndemonstrated no significant difference in survival at mid\ufffeto long-term follow-up. Meta-analysis demonstrated lungs \naccepted for EVLP had significantly lower PaO2/FiO2\nratio and a greater incidence of radiographic abnormality, \nhowever, this did not translate to a significant difference \nin overall survival, 30-day mortality, or primary graft \ndysfunction grade 3 at 72 h between EVLP and standard \ncohorts. EVLP offers the ability to expand the lung donor \npool with acceptable mid- to long-term survival outcomes.\nAcknowledgments\nNone.\nFootnote\nConflicts of Interest: The authors have no conflicts of interest \nto declare.\nReferences\n1.
