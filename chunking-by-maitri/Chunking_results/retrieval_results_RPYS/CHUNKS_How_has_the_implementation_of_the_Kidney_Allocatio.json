Increasing use of kidneys\ntowards SLK transplantation diverts deceased donor kidneys\naway from candidates awaiting kidney-alone transplantation.\nRecently OPTN/United Network of Organ Sharing has imple\ufffemented medical eligibility criteria for adult SLK transplantation\nwhich also includes a concept of safety net. Implementation of\nthe new policy is a move in a positive direction, providing\nconsistency in our practice and evidence-based guidelines in\nselecting candidates for SLK transplantation. This policy needs\nto be monitored prospectively and modified based on new data\nthat will emerge over time.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) can\ndevelop in up to 23% of patients with cirrhosis, while chronic\nkidney disease (CKD) is present in 1% of such patients.1,2\nSince introduction of the model for end-stage liver disease\n(MELD) scoring system for organ allocation in liver transplant\ncandidates in 2002, the incidence of renal dysfunction among\nliver transplant recipients has been significantly increasing,\ncontributing to an increasing trend in simultaneous liver\ufffekidney transplantation (SLK) after 2002.3\u20135\nAKI affects 25% to 50% of liver transplant recipients, while\nCKD develops in 30% to 90% and risk of end-stage renal\ndisease (ESRD) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) is in\nthe range of 2% to 5% per year after transplantation.6 Native\nkidney function recovery following liver transplantation alone\n(LTA) is difficult to predict, and indications for SLK transplanta\ufffetion are not precisely defined. The decision to transplant SLK\nhas largely been center-specific and driven by the fear of per\ufffesistent renal failure after LTA and its associated poor outcomes.\nA recent study identified early liver allograft dysfunction, early\ndevelopment of stage 3 AKI following LTA and requirement for\nRRT at the time of liver transplantation as independent risk\nfactors for the development of ESRD within first year of LTA.7\nPredictors of renal function recovery with good discrimina\ufffetion following LTA are poorly defined. Patients wait-listed for\nkidney transplantation after nonrenal organ transplantation\nhave worse outcomes compared to patients waiting for kidney\ntransplant alone (KTA).8 Currently, the outcomes of SLK trans\ufffeplants are excluded from Scientific Registry of Transplant\nRecipients, further encouraging the transplant centers to add\nkidney to a high-risk liver candidate in order to buffer their\nprogram\u2019s outcome.4 Lack of uniform criteria for allocating\nkidney to SLK has led to marked variation in the rates of SLK\ntransplantation among transplant centers, ranging from 0% to\n44% of all liver transplants performed.9 With the increasing\ntrend in the number of SLK transplants has come controversy",

        "text": "recipients with listing estimated GFR <35 mL/min who were not\non RRT at the time of transplantation.31,32 Hence, one could\nargue the medical eligibility criteria of GFR <35 mL/min at the\ntime of listing in the proposed policy as liberal. There is possi\ufffebility of abuse with these criteria for listing of SLK if there is one\ntime documentation of GFR <35 mL/min. There is also concern\nthat this policy might in fact further increase the rate of SLK\ntransplantation.33 It is also possible that the new criteria could\npotentially decrease the number of SLK transplants performed,\nsince 19% all SLK transplants performed between 2014 and\n2015 did not meet current proposed criteria.\nProven factors for CKD, such as the presence of long standing\npretransplant diabetes or proteinuria, were not incorporated in\nthe proposed policy.34 More controversial and liberal is the AKI\ndefinition in the policy.30 These patients comprise about 40% of\nall SLK transplantations. Less than 10% of patients with LTA are\non dialysis in the first year of transplantation, indicating that\nmany recover native renal function.22 Asch et al.30 also propose\nthe concept of futility to be added to the policy, where organs are\nnot being offered to patients with poor projected survival.30\nThe proposed policy of SLK is based on the tenet of urgency,\nwhich contradicts the new kidney allocation system based on\nthe tenet of utility. SLK transplantation exemplifies the tradeoff\nbetween the principle of utility and medical urgency, as shown\nby a recent Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data\ufffebase analysis that compared kidney allograft life span in SLK\nrecipients to donor-matched kidneys transplanted as KTA or\nsimultaneous pancreas kidney transplantation. The adjusted\n10-year mean kidney allograft life span was higher in KTA and\nsimultaneous pancreas kidney recipients compared with SLK\nrecipients by 0.99 years in the MELD era and 1.71 years in the\npreMELD era. In other words, about 1 year of renal allograft life\nspan is traded with SLK transplantation, so that a sicker patient\ngains access to organs.35\nThe proposed policy for SLK transplantation does not\naddress the current multiorgan transplantation policy, which\nconflicts with the OPTN\u2019s \u201cfinal rule\u201d based on sound medical\njudgment to ensure equity and efficacy in organ allocation.\nThe current multiorgan transplant policy provides kidney\nallocation with another organ, regardless of the degree and\nduration of renal dysfunction, potential of kidney function\nrecovery and the survival benefit of the addition of kidney.34\nA recent study by Ekser et al.,\n36 described a novel idea of\ndelaying the kidney allograft for >48 h in patients undergoing\ncombined liver kidney transplantation.36 Liver transplantation\nis first performed while the kidney allograft is placed on the\nhypothermic pulsatile machine in order to allow time to stabi\ufffelize the patient\u2019s hemodynamics and normalize coagulopathy\nbefore implantation of the kidney allograft, thus reducing the\nrisk for delayed graft function development and optimizing the\nrenal allograft function. This approach was associated with\nsuperior graft and patient survival rates during the 4 year\nfollow-up. This could also avoid the wastage of kidney allograft\nin high-risk liver transplant patients.\nFinally, the interesting question as to whether liver is\nimmune-protective to the kidney in the setting of SLK trans\ufffeplantation has been asked. A recent study looked at the\nincidence of kidney allograft rejection between SLK (n = 68)\nand KTA (n = 136) recipients, utilizing protocol renal transplant\nbiopsies.37 Pretransplant donor-specific antibodies were\npresent in 20.5% of the patients in both groups. Among patients\nwith donor-specific antibodies, there was higher incidence of\nantibody-mediated rejection (46.4% vs. 7.1%) and transplant\nglomerulopathy (53.6% vs. 0%) in KTA versus SLK recipients.\nTable 2.

To deal with these high-MELD \nscore recipients with pre-transplant renal dysfunction, some \ntransplantation centers in the US have started to incorporate in\ufffetraoperative renal replacement therapy (ioRRT). Unfortunately, \na significant amount of strong evidence validating the usefulness \nof ioRRT during LT is scarce. In Korea, LT candidate prioritiza\ufffetion changed from the Child Turcotte Pugh scoring system to \nthe MELD scoring system in June 2016.

Intraoperative \nrenal replacement therapy (ioRRT) has emerged as one of the solutions available to manage high-MELD score recipients; \nhowever, its usefulness has not yet been proven. To date, we have experienced five cases of simultaneous liver and kidney \ntransplantation (SLKT). Recipients of SLKT tend to have a lower pre-transplant kidney function and the longer operation \ntime mandates a larger amount of fluid than LT alone. Hence, anesthetic care is more prone to be challenged by hyper\ufffekalemia, metabolic acidosis, and volume overload, making ioRRT a theoretically valuable intervention. However, in all \nfive cases, recipients were managed without ioRRT, resulting in excellent graft and patient survival. As such, in this case \nseries, we discuss current issues about ioRRT and SLKT.\nKey Words: Acidosis, Hyperkalemia, Liver transplantation, Renal replacement therapy.\nA case series on simultaneous \nliver and kidney transplantation: \ndo we need intraoperative renal \nreplacement therapy?\nWongook Wi, Tae Soo Hahm, and Gaab-Soo Kim\nDepartment of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea\nCC This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/\nlicenses/by-nc/4.0/), which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nCopyright \u24d2 the Korean Society of Anesthesiologists, 2017 Online access in http://ekja.org\npISSN 2005-6419 \u2022 eISSN 2005-7563 KJA\nKorean Journal of Anesthesiology\nCorresponding author: Gaab-Soo Kim, M.D., Ph.D.\nDepartment of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Samsung Medical \nCenter, 81, Ilwon-ro, Gangnam-gu, Seoul 06351, Korea\nTel: 82-2-3410-0360, Fax: 82-2-3410-0361\nEmail: gskim@skku.edu\nORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9383-2652\nReceived: October 27, 2016. \nRevised: February 6, 2017 (1st); February 20, 2017 (2nd). \nAccepted: February 22, 2017.\nKorean J Anesthesiol 2017 August 70(4): 467-476",

        "text": "enrolment process of the interventional study arm was planned considering one procedure per month (liver or \nkidney perfusion before transplantation) following the inclusion criteria in the period from October 2016 to \nDecember 2017. The study was meant to evaluate the safety of a new machine perfusion system, and therefore we \ndecided to monitor adverse events after each procedure for the first 30 post-operative days before enrolling other \nnew cases. During the study period we performed 116 LTs, 60 of which met the inclusion criteria and 10 of which \nwere included in the study according to the aforementioned safety protocol. Similarly we recluted 60 KTs, which \nmet the inclusion criteria, and among those 10 were included according to the protocol. The study underwent \nclinical trial registration (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03031067; 01/25/2017). The organ allocation process fol\ufffelowed our center algorithm6,8,46,47. Each patient included in the study group was transplanted with ECD graft, liver \nor kidney, restored in the pre-implantation phase by HOPE. Patients\u2019 outcomes (HOPE-L and HOPE-K groups) \nwere compared to the ones of matched control groups composed by liver and kidney recipients transplanted from \nJanuary 2004 to September 2017 in the same transplant center, whose organs were preserved by SCS (SCS-L and \nSCS-K groups respectively).\nDemographical, clinical, machine perfusion and histological data collection was performed prospectively for \nthe study groups and retrospectively for the control groups.\nMatching study and control cases. Study cases of HOPE-L and HOPE-K groups were matched 1:3 to \ncontrol cases of SCS-L and SCS-K groups; the pairing was performed anonymously using different clinical fea\ufffetures about each donor and recipient involved.\nHOPE-L and SCS-L groups were matched for donor and recipient age, CIT, model of end-stage liver disease \n(MELD) score, previous abdominal surgery and portal thrombosis.\nHOPE-K and SCS-K groups were matched for donor and recipient age, (CIT), Karpinski\u2019s score, dialyses type \n(peritoneal or hemodialysis) and dialyses time.\nRecipient and donor selection. ECD-DBDs aged over 18 years were considered eligible for study inclusion \nafter acquisition of informed consent by the family.

        "text": "Minjae Kim, et al. Simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation 457\nalso underwent KT (DDKT in 11 and LDKT in 23). Thus, \nsequential LT-KT was performed in 34 patients. Current\ufffely, 51 patients are in the waiting list of DDKT. Eleven \nof them were enrolled before LT and 40 patients were en\ufffelisted after LT.\nDISCUSSION\nA considerable proportion of patients with both end\ufffestage liver and kidney diseases have undergone LT alone \nor SLKT worldwide. Recently, the proportion of SLKT \namong all LTs in the United States increased up to 9.9% \nin 2016.3,4 Meanwhile, because of profound deceased do\ufffenor shortage in Korea, around 1% of LT candidates had \nundergone deceased donor SLKT in the current analysis \nof the KONOS database. In our institution, only 0.2% of \ntotal LT cases underwent SLKT with deceased or living \ndonors. To the best of our knowledge, our Case No. 1 \nwas the first case of SLKT in Korea. Considering that KT \nwas performed in 3 patients before LT and 34 patients \nafter LT, the sum of combined LT and KT was 48, ac\ufffecounting for 0.7% of total LT cases. In addition, 51 pa\ufffetients are currently enrolled in the waiting list of DDKT. \nConsidering that there are many other patients showing \nslow but progressive deterioration of renal function after \nLT, the demand for KT in LT recipients would be higher \nthan we calculated.\nInformation on SLKT in Korea is very limited. There \nare only a few case reports of SLKT from Korean trans\ufffeplant centers in the literature.5-8 A Korean single-center \nreport on 3000 cases of KT has presented the performance \nof 16 cases of SLKT,9\n however, detailed information on \nSLKT was not described. This was the primary reason \nthat we carried out this study.\nRenal disease has high impacts on LT candidates. \nSerum creatinine is included in the MELD scoring system \nbecause renal impairment is associated with a substantial \nincrease in 30\u2010day mortality, especially if an LT candidate \nrequires dialysis.1,3 Renal impairment is a common occur\uffference in patients with liver disease. Some studies in\ufffedicated that its prevalence is 15%-20% in LT candidates.10\nThe requirement to update MELD scores after the initial \nlisting allows for allocation of a liver to those most in \nneed.\nRenal disease on LT recipients also has a high prog\ufffenostic impact. The impact of kidney disease on LT candi\ufffedates is not limited to pretransplant mortality. LT recipi\ufffeents who develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) following \nLT show significant increases of liver allograft failure and \nmortality compared to those who do not develop CKD af\ufffeter LT. Significant renal disease prior to LT is the most \nimportant risk factor for CKD after LT. Determining the \ncause of acute kidney injury in LT candidates can be chal\ufffelenging, which complicates the ability to assess potential \nrenal recovery after LT. LT candidates on dialysis for \nmore than 90 days with advanced CKD and prolonged \nacute kidney injury not from hepatorenal syndrome have \na higher risk for significant renal impairment after LT.11\nAfter the introduction of MELD criteria for allocation \nof LT in the United States, there was a more than 400% \nincrease in SLKT, from 2.5% in 2001 to 9.9% in 2016. \nThis change was driven primarily by poor outcomes of \nLT recipients with posttransplant kidney disease, an in\ufffeability to predict which candidates were likely to develop \npost\u2010LT CKD, and the lack of a mechanism to expedite \nKT in LT recipients who developed advanced CKD after \nLT.11 The introduction of MELD score to the KONOS liv\ufffeer allocation system and an increase in the number of de\ufffeceased donors raised the proportion of deceased donor \nSLKT from 0.6% before the adoption of MELD score to \n1.2% after the adoption of MELD score in the present \nstudy.12-14 Although this increase was statistically sig\ufffenificant, the proportion of SLKT was still very low com\ufffepared to that in the United States.11,15\nAn analysis of United Network for Organ Sharing \n(UNOS)/Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network",
