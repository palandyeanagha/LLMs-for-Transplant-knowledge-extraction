All the questionnaires were returned,\nand the candidate criteria were ranked according to their\npriority votes, with the 12 criteria that ranked highest\nforming the preliminary core set of criteria. A third ques\ufffetionnaire was mailed to each Panel member asking them\nto select the necessary criteria, defined as criteria that must\nbe present and the presence of which must be ascertained\nin order to define patients as having TAM. All the ques\ufffetionnaires were returned, three necessary criteria were\nidentified (>80 % consensus) and the other candidate cri\ufffeteria were ranked according to their priority votes. The\nthree necessary criteria and the four optional criteria that\nranked highest formed the core set of criteria.\nDevelopment of candidate diagnostic definitions\nUsing a mail-only system, we performed an appropri\ufffeateness panel process in order to develop candidate\ndiagnostic definitions of TAM. The overall goal of the\nprocess was to decide upon the definition of the disor\ufffeder based on the core set of criteria, using a combination\nof statistical and consensus formation techniques.\n18 In\norder to achieve this, the co-ordinator of the project\ngenerated 16 constructed patient profiles based on the\ncore set of diagnostic criteria. The profiles listed the\nfindings of the patients for each criterion of the core set.\nThe participants were asked to rate each of the profiles\nas appropriate or not appropriate for the diagnosis of TAM\nbased on the individual physician\u2019s clinical judgement.\nIf an 80% consensus about whether a constructed\npatient\u2019s profile did or did not have TAM was not\nachieved, the case with the comments from the pan\ufffeelists was redistributed to the panelists, and a second\nvote was taken. If an 80% consensus was still not\nattained, the patient\u2019s profile was declared uninter\ufffepretable and was not considered further.\nBy using combinations of the variables in the core set,\n24 sound candidate definitions of TAM were generated\nfor testing. The candidate definitions required the pres\ufffeence of the three necessary criteria and one to four\noptional criteria.\nEvaluation of the performance characteristics of the\ncandidate diagnostic definitions\nThe 16 profiles were then used to test the candidate\ndiagnostic definitions for their ability to classify individ\ufffeual patients as having or not having TAM, using the\nphysicians\u2019 consensus in the rating of the constructed\npatient profiles as a gold standard. The agreement\nbetween the decision based on the criteria and the con\ufffesensus of the physicians was assessed. Only the patient\nprofiles for which a physician consensus was achieved\nwere used. For each definition, we calculated the sensi\ufffetivity (ability of the definition to identify a patient as\nhaving TAM when he/she had been classified as having\nTAM by the physicians), the specificity (ability of the\ndefinition to identify a patient as not having TAM\nwhen he/she had been classified as not having TAM by\nthe physicians), the rate of false-positivity ([number of\npatients falsely identified as having TAM by the given\ncriteria divided by all patients identified as having\nTAM\u00d7100), and the rate of false-negativity ([number of\npatients falsely identified as not having TAM by the\ngiven criteria divided by all patients identified as not\nhaving TAM] \u00d7100).

Ideally, a local \u201cHeart team\u201d\nrepresenting respective expertise should discuss the differ\ufffeent treatment options in every patient with advanced heart\nfailure. Because of the painful shortage of donor hearts, this\ndiscussion is likewise recommended even when patients\nare potential candidates for heart transplantation.\nIndication for heart transplantation\nThe main indication of HTx is persistent advanced chronic\nheart failure despite optimal medical treatment of left\nventricular dysfunction. For candidacy, the patients will\nhave to fulfill various criteria (table 1) with cardiopulmon\ufffeary exercise testing playing the central role. Nevertheless,\nthe decision on a candidacy for HTx should take into ac\ufffecount all clinical data rather than focusing on peak oxygen\nuptake alone [3], and, usually, is obtained after multidiscip\ufffelinary discussion.\nThe timing of referral is of central importance and, ideally,\npotential HTx candidates should be presented to a respect\ufffeive centre ahead of the manifestation of other organ dys\ufffefunctions related to heart failure (e.g., cardiorenal syn\ufffedrome, pulmonary hypertension, liver dysfunction, meta\ufffebolic syndrome). Indicators that should prompt considera\ufffetion for referral are indicated in table 2.\nTable 1: Criteria for heart transplantation.\nCommon criteria\n1. Impaired left ventricular systolic dysfunction\n2. NYHA III (e.g., patient cannot climb one flight of stairs without\ndyspnoea) or IV symptoms\n3. Receiving optimal medical treatment on maximal dosage tolerated\n4. CRT, ICD or CRTD implanted when indicated\n5. Evidence of poor prognosis on the basis of cardiopulmonary\nexercise testing (VO2max <12 ml/kg/min if on \u03b2-blockade, and <14\nml/min/kg if not on \u03b2-blockade, ensuring respiratory equivalent ratio\n\u22641.05) markedly elevated NT-proBNP (or BNP) serum levels despite\nof optimal medical treatment established composite prognostic\nscoring system (HFSS, SHFM)\nUncommon criteria\n1.

Therefore, other organ\ndysfunction not likely to improve, posttransplant, may pre\ufffeclude HTx in the individual patient. In contrast, other organ\ndysfunction often does not preclude HTx if related with the\nseverity of HF and thus likely to improve after HTx.\nAdvanced heart failure is most often associated with renal,\nhepatic, pulmonary, and metabolic dysfunction.

Patients who met diagnostic criteria for HFpEF and who were followed as part of \nthe University of Michigan HFpEF outpatient clinic were prospectively enrolled into a research database. The \ndiagnosis of HFpEF was ascertained by board certified cardiologists with expertise in this disease entity (S.L.H. \nor M.C.K.). HFpEF was defined according to the criteria established by the 2016 European Society of Cardiol\ufffeogy guidelines6\n. In brief, this definition requires symptoms and signs of heart failure (elevated natriuretic pep\ufffetide and either relevant structural heart disease or diastolic dysfunction) among patients with ejection fraction \n\u226550%. The database encompasses patients presenting from February 2014 to February 2018.\nData collection. At the time of enrollment, demographics, vital signs, medications, and comorbid condi\ufffetions were recorded. New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification was documented as an assessment of \nheart failure severity. Dyslipidemia was defined based on use of statin or cholesterol lowering medications or \nICD-9 or 10 codes. Additional data not entered at time of initial enrollment were abstracted retrospectively via \nelectronic chart review. Laboratory data including complete blood cell counts, lipids, kidney function, hepatic \npanel, international normalized ratio (INR), hemoglobin A1c, and pro-brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) were \nabstracted if obtained during routine clinical care within two years of the initial clinic encounter. Echocardio\ufffegrams (ECHO) obtained within 2\u00a0years of the clinic encounter were reviewed and measurements of chamber \nsize, wall thickness, diastolic function, and right ventricular function were recorded. The study was approved by \nthe University of Michigan Institutional Review Board (IRB). Given use of de-identified patient data, the IRB \ngranted exception for need of individual patient consent for the retrospective analysis. All patients provided \ninformed consent to initially be included in the HFpEF registry. All methods were performed in accordance with \nthe relevant guidelines and regulations.\nAssessment of liver disease. The diagnosis of NAFLD was ascertained using a combination of natural \nlanguage processing program (University of Michigan EMERSE7\n) and manual chart review by a board certi\ufffefied hepatologist (M.A.T.) with specific expertise in NAFLD7\n. A patient was classified as meeting criteria for \nNAFLD if they had any of the following in the absence of other causes of liver disease: evidence of steatosis or \nsteatohepatitis on liver biopsy; imaging [including ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) scan or mag\ufffenetic resonance imaging (MRI)] noting hepatic steatosis; a clinical diagnosis code (ICD-9 or 10) for NAFLD or \nnon-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); or a combination of the above. Given clinical practice patterns, very few \npatients had liver biopsy performed and thus it was not possible to definitively distinguish NAFLD vs NASH \namong the entire cohort. Patients were also assessed for a history of significant alcohol use (defined as >21 \ndrinks per week in men and >14 drinks per week in women or clinical diagnosis of alcohol use disorder) based \non chart review. In addition, charts were reviewed for other causes of chronic liver disease including viral hepa\ufffetitis, autoimmune liver disease or hereditary forms of liver disease. The presence of cirrhosis was determined \nbased on results of imaging or ICD-9 or 10 codes. To assess stage of liver disease, a Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index and \nNAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) were calculated for each patient, both of which have been used in heart failure",

Patients with ACC/AHA \nstage D HF, haemodynamic instability requiring inotropic or \nmechanical circulatory support, evidence of right-sided congestive \nHF with moderate/severe right ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary \nartery systolic pressure >70 mmHg were excluded. \nThe mean age of participants was 72 years, 64% were men and 61% \nhad ischaemic cardiomyopathy. Mean values for echocardiographic \ndata were 101 ml/m2 for LVEDV index, 31% for LVEF, 6.2 cm for LVESD \nand 0.41 cm2\n for EROA. The surgical risk was not high in one-third of the \npatients. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score for the risk of \ndeath within 30 days after mitral-valve replacement was 7.8% in \nMitraClip arm versus 8.5% in GDMT arm. NYHA class II HF was present \nin 39% of the patients and NYHA class III was present in 52% of the \npatients. The percentage of patients on diuretics, ACEI, ARB or ARNI, \nand beta-blockers was similar to the MITRA-FR trial, however exact \ndosages were not available for comparison. MitraClip was not \nattempted in six patients. Of the 293 undergoing MitraClip, technical \nsuccess was achieved in 98% of the patients. \nAt discharge, 82% had <1+ MR and 12.7% has \u22642+ MR. The MR grade \nwas \u22642+ in 92.7% patients at 30 days, 93.8% at 6 months, 94.8% at 1 year \nand 99.1% at 2 years. The primary endpoint of all HF hospitalisations at \n2 years was significantly reduced with MitraClip (35.8%) compared with \nGDMT alone (67.9%; HR 0.53; 95% CI [0.40\u20130.70]), translating into a \nnumber needed to treat (NNT) of 3.1.

The results were \nsimilar in all the pre-specified subgroups based on age, sex, LVEF, LVEDV \nand surgical risk. The incidence of LVAD or heart transplant was \nsignificantly lower in the device arm compared with GDMT alone (4.4% \nversus 9.5%). All other secondary endpoints such as MR grade reduction, \nquality of life and NYHA class were significantly lower in the MitraClip \ngroup. The mean LVEDV increased by 17.1 ml in the control arm \ncompared with a reduction of 5.1 ml in patients receiving the MitraClip \n(p<0.001). In summary, this large randomised trial reported that MitraClip \nreduced the rate of HF hospitalisations and all-cause mortality and \nimproved 6-minute walk distance and quality of life in patients with \nmoderate-severe or severe SMR who were carefully screened to \ndetermine that they were taking maximally tolerated GDMT. \nA recent sub-analysis of the COAPT data showed that reduction of MR \nto \u22642+ by either MitraClip plus GDMT or GDMT alone was associated \nwith a significant reduction in risk of HF hospitalisation or all-cause \nmortality compared with MR \u22653+ (73.5%). There was no significant \ndifference in this combined outcome between 0/1 (38.6%) and 2+ \n(49.8%) MR groups. At 30 days, 92.7% of the patients in the MitraClip \narm had \u22642+ MR compared with 34.3% patients in the GDMT alone \narm.

Specifically, although included in the \ncurrent definition of AHF, levels of natriuretic pep\ufffetides can be elevated in respiratory disease and other \nacute conditions such as pulmonary embolism, sepsis, \nand\u00a0anaemia21\u201324.\nAny acute condition can be further complicated \nby the external factors present in emergency settings, \nsuch as high ambient noise and restrictive space, limit\ufffeing a clinician\u2019s ability to position the patient optimally \nfor examination. Furthermore, the frequently atypical \nfeatures of very severe pathology (in particular valvular \ndisease), and the time pressures imposed by an acutely \ndeteriorating patient can contribute to poor outcomes. \nThese factors are further confounded by the presence \nof concomitant pathologies in the increasingly ageing \npatient population25.\nEchocardiography and LUS are readily available and \nwidely validated techniques that can be used to reveal \nanatomical and physiological abnormalities in patients \nwith AHF, which when correctly applied in the acute \nsetting, can improve patient assessment, management, \nand outcomes (FIGS\u00a01,2)\n26. Unlike other biomarkers used \nin AHF, echocardiography and LUS can be used to \nidentify not only inadequate cardiac output and/or the \npresence of congestion, but also the underlying cause, \nallowing the most appropriate, individualized inter\ufffeventions to be delivered immediately to the patient27. \nFurthermore, these imaging modalities can be used to \nmonitor the effects of treatment (either beneficial or \ndetrimental), as well as to guide patient disposition and \ninterventions as indicated28. Pocket-sized echocardio\ufffegraphy devices are practical for screening, and provide \ninformation to clinicians in addition to that gath\ufffeered from auscultation by a stethoscope alone.

        "text": "the collective memory of the earlier high mortality or\nprolonged hospital courses associated with primary\nFontan surgery in past decades has made many\nclinicians reluctant to recommend additional inter\ufffeventions, particularly without overt symptoms.\nIn addition to standard haemodynamic evalua\ufffetions, more global assessment of the impact of the\nFontan physiology on other organ systems needs to\nbecome part of routine surveillance (table 2). It\ncannot be assumed that the patient has other\nhealthcare providers with adequate knowledge of\nthe impact of the Fontan circulation to monitor\nthese systems. Growth failure in childhood and\nweight loss in adulthood are advanced manifesta\ufffetions of inadequate haemodynamic status. In\nadulthood, exercise intolerance may result in\nextremes of a sedentary lifestyle and result in obe\ufffesity. By contributing to alterations in pulmonary\nfunctionw22 and increased systemic vascular resis\ufffetance, overweight contributes rapidly to Fontan\nfailure. Patients should be counselled on the\nimportance of regular aerobic activity for condi\ufffetioning, and avoidance of overweight as essential to\nlimiting Fontan failure.\nIn the USA, the cardiologist caring for Fontan\npatients is now asked to routinely monitor and\nassess other organ systems, including haematologic,\nendocrine, pulmonary, hepatic and gastrointestinal,\nwithin the confines of decreased reimbursement for\ntesting and shorter office visits. The barriers to\nsophisticated medical care for the older Fontan\npatient encompass difficulties in education of the\npatient relative to the need for regular cardiac care,\navailability of comprehensive integrated care\ncentres with sufficient expertise, and in many\ncountries the lack of healthcare coverage. None\ufffetheless, it is apparent that a change in practice for\nthe routine long term follow-up of Fontan patients\nis necessary in order to detect progressive subtle\ndecline in status and to have a favourable impact on\nthe functional status of these unique survivors\n(table 3). Failure to change our standard methods of\nroutine cardiac care in this setting constitutes\na failure of optimal medical management. Chronic\npulmonary vasodilator therapy, in addition to\nchronic diuresis, may become part of routine long\nterm medical therapy as this population ages.w25\nTable 3 Long term Fontan surveillance\nParameters Monitoring\nConstitutional Adequate growth in childhood\nWeight or muscle loss in adulthood\nAvoid overweight\nBlood pressure: normotensive\nFunctional classification,\nAerobic activity\nDaily napping\nAerobic activity\nExercise testing\nCardiac haemodynamics Heart size\nAtrial dilatation\nAtriopulmonary anastomosis\nPulmonary narrowing, distortion\nPulmonary venous or atrioventricular (AV)\ninflow obstruction\nAV valve regurgitation or stenosis\nAortic insufficiency\nVentricular outflow obstruction\nArch obstruction\nVentricular function\nEchocardiogram\nPeriodic chest radiograph\nCardiac MRI or CT\nRhythm Presence of atrial versus junctional rhythm\nResting heart rate\nChronotropic response to exertion\nArrhythmia development\nPeriodic 24 h ambulatory monitoring; event monitoring\nPulmonary Hypoxaemia\nVascular resistance\nOxygen saturation, resting and exertional\nEndocrine Thyroid function Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroxine (T4)\nRenal Blood urea nitrogen, creatinine\nHepatic Hepatomegaly\nCardiac cirrhosis\nSynthetic function\nLiver function: enzymes, coagulation\nAbdominal ultrasound, CT or MR\nLiver biopsy\nSerum a-fetoprotein\nGastrointestinal Bloating, distension, diarrhoea, ascites, gallstones Stool a-1 anti-trypsin\nHaematologic Anaemia, polycythaemia, thrombocytopenia Blood count, platelets\nMetabolic B-type natriuretic peptide, albumin, alkaline phosphatase\nNeurologic Cerebrovascular accident\nDepression\nManagement of the failing Fontan circulation: key points\n< Symptoms develop at an advanced stage of declining Fontan circulation.\n< Identification of the \u2018failing\u2019 Fontan before the development of ascites or",

        "text": "We have to mention also the non-invasive technologies:\nthe Nexfin (BMEye, Edwards Life Sciences, Amsterdam,\nThe Netherlands) and the Masimo (Masimo Corporation,\nIrvine, CA, USA). The Nexfin device uses a finger pneu\ufffematic cuff to evaluate a continuous non-invasive arterial\npressure curve, through which it estimates the CO by pulse\ncontour analysis. The Masimo provides a non-invasive es\ufffetimation of the plethysmography variability index (PVI) as\na consequence of variation in peripheral pulse oximetry,\nwhich has been shown to be related to pulse pressure vari\ufffeation (PPV). PVI is a good predictor of fluid responsive\ufffeness and has proven to be a reliable indicator in cardiac\nand colorectal surgery, but only in the context of a\nhemodynamically stable patient [69,70].\nWhat is still missing in the literature is to determine\nwhether different instruments play different roles and if\ndifferent populations of patients (ASA II-III versus IV)\ncan benefit from these techniques. Finally, what is really\nimportant for GTD is its fundamental (patho) physio\ufffelogical concept: pay the \u201cfluid debt\u201d but also pay it \u201con\ntime\u201d, within the intraoperative and first 6\u20138 postopera\ufffetive hours.\nA recent survey [71] shows that the use of GDT differs\naccording to the medical and anesthesiological culture\npromoted in different settings: it is more widespread in\nthe UK compared to the Australian/New Zealand. The\nmajority of the respondents were involved in major ab\ufffedominal and orthopedic surgery and used GDT in patients\nwith significant comorbidities. The most significant bar\uffferiers that hamper the adoption of the GDT were either a\nlack of availability of monitoring tools or a lack of experi\ufffeence with these instruments [72].\nThere is a long-standing debate on this manipulation\nof oxygen delivery in high-risk surgical patients: a thera\ufffepeutic option may be not to stop at the achievement of\nthe normalization of hemodynamic values, but to go\nfurther and aim for a \u201csupranormal oxygen delivery\u201d,\ndescribed as the therapeutic goal of a DO2I > 600 ml/\nmin/m2. This trend began in the \u201870s and \u201980s with the\n\u201cmilestone\u201d of Shoemaker [73], showing that the in\ufffeduction of a hyperdynamic cardiovascular status was\nprotective reducing the postoperative morbidity and\nmortality. However there is no lack of criticism of this\napproach, as it has been revised only by single-center\nstudies with unintentional bias due to lack of blinding\nand different inclusion criteria and definitions. Concern\ufffeing the complications, the most feared are those related\nto invasive monitoring and cardiac complications asso\ufffeciated with fluid challenges and inotropes administra\ufffetion. Other studies failed to show any survival benefit\nattributable to supranormal GDT [74].\nA recent metanalysis has shown that the benefit of\nGDT is most pronounced in patients receiving fluid\nand inotrope therapy to achieve a supranormal oxygen\ndelivery target, with the use of minimally invasive cardiac\nmonitors [75].\nPerioperative optimization can be guided by lactates\nlevels too: the development of an imbalance between oxy\ufffegen delivery and oxygen consumption, define as oxygen\ndebt, lead to lactates production above normal levels.\nFigure 3 Fluid flow-chart. The steps reported represent a rational approach to fluid management in ASA I-III patients.\nDella Rocca et al.
