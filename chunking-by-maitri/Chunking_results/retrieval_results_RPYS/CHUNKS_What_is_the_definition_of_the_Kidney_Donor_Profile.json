Overall, the observed changes in the expression of cell \nsurface membranes proteins indicates that deceased donor plasma is able to cause PMN activation.\nWe next considered whether overall donor quality was associated with the ability of donor plasma \nto activate healthy donor PMNs. The Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) is a numerical measurement \nbased on the Kidney Donor Risk Index that combines 10 donor factors, including clinical parameters and \ndemographics, to summarize the quality of deceased donor kidneys relative to other recovered kidneys into \na single number (33). Thus, it provides a quantitative measurement of donor quality. Using cell surface \nexpression of CD11b as a marker of PMN activation, we observed a moderate but significant correlation \nbetween KDPI and activation of PMNs by donor plasma (Figure 2C). These data indicate that a donor\u2019s \nhealth status may contribute to their inflammatory state.\nPlasma from deceased organ donors induces ROS production by PMNs. Upon activation, PMNs typically \nundergo an oxidative burst that results in the production of ROS. We hypothesized that soluble factors \npresent in deceased donor plasma can activate PMNs to produce increased levels of ROS. To test this, we \ncompared ROS production induced by healthy donor PMNs treated ex vivo with plasma from DBD and \nDCD donors to ROS production induced by healthy donor heterologous and autologous plasma (PMNs \nand serum from same healthy donor) using a luminescence-based assay.

Recently, CADI was\nvalidated in a multicenter study as a surrogate end point for\nlong-term graft function (11). Currently, either Banff 97 or\nCADI classifications is used to quantify renal allograft\ndamage because they are both useful for predicting renal\ngraft outcome (5,9,11,12).\nThe objective of this study was to determine which of\nthese classifications is the best grading system for predict\ufffeing loss of graft function due to chronic allograft nephropa\ufffethy. Furthermore, we also evaluated the independent fac\ufffetors associated with graft loss within both grading systems.\nSubjects and Methods\nA total of 1990 consecutive biopsies of deceased and\nliving-donor kidney transplant patients performed at the\nFederal University of S\u00e3o Paulo (UNIFESP) between 2000\nand 2003, with at least 6 months of graft function, were\nreviewed retrospectively. A total of 450 biopsies with a\nproven diagnosis of CAN was initially identified. Biopsies\nwere excluded from the study if the patients 1) were recipi\ufffeents of a previous organ transplant, 2) were currently\nreceiving a multiorgan transplant, 3) had a high immuno\ufffelogical risk at the time of transplantation, defined as having\na previously measured panel-reactive antibody grade of\n>60%, 4) had de novo post-transplant glomerulonephritis\nor post-transplantation glomerulonephritis without known\nprimary etiology of chronic renal disease, or 5) had tumors\nafter transplantation. Finally, we included and re-reviewed\n161 transplant patient biopsies with chronic allograft ne\ufffephropathy in this cohort. The Ethics Committee on Human\nResearch of our Institution (UNIFESP) reviewed and ap\ufffeproved this study.\nOperational definition\nDelayed graft function was defined as the requirement\nfor dialysis during the first week after transplantation with\ufffeout rejection and/or technical problems. Acute rejection\nwas defined as when patients with graft dysfunction pre\ufffesented a biopsy with matched Banff 97 criteria or when the\ndysfunction resolved after a minimum of 3 doses of\nmethylprednisone over 3 days in the absence of other\ncauses of dysfunction. Any rejection before the 3rd month\nof transplantation was classified as early acute rejection,\nwhile rejection after this period was considered late rejec\ufffetion. Systemic arterial hypertension was defined as re\ufffepeated elevated blood pressure exceeding 140/90 mmHg\nor when patients were using at least one anti-hypertensive\ndrug. New onset of diabetes after transplantation (NODAT)\nwas defined as when fasting plasma glucose was \u2265126\nmg/dL (\u22657 mmol/L), with random blood sugar level \u2265200\nmg/dL (\u226511.1 mmol/L) accompanied by symptoms, or oral\nglucose tolerance test \u2265200 mg/dL. Renal function was\nmeasured by serum creatinine and by creatinine clear\ufffeance and calculated using the Cockroft-Gault equation.\nHistological analyses\nAt least four stained slides were used for quantification of\nhistological changes in each biopsy, one stained with hema\ufffetoxylin-eosin, one with Masson\u2019s trichrome, one with peri\ufffeodic acid-Schiff and one with silver stain. All sections had\nmore than 5 glomeruli per slide. All biopsy specimens were\nreviewed by two independent pathologists, using both grad\ufffeing systems on each biopsy, before inclusion in the study.\nBiopsy specimens of all cases were evaluated and\ngraded according to the Banff 97 criteria (8) and CADI\n(10,11). CAN was subdivided into three grades according\nto the Banff 97 classification that evaluates and/or grades\nthe severity of chronic allograft nephropathy based on the\nevaluation of tubular and interstitial parameters to mini\ufffemize sampling error problems (4). Grade I (mild) is charac\ufffeterized by mild interstitial fibrosis, grade II (moderate)",

The Charlson co-morbidity index (CCI) is\na validated summary measure of premorbid chronic dis\ufffeease that correlates with 1-year mortality. The CCI com\ufffeprises 22 different chronic conditions. Each condition is\nassigned a score (range, 1, 2, 3, or 6, depending on the\nseverity and the risk of dying associated with this condi\ufffetion) and added to provide a composite score [18]. We\nused a modified version of this by excluding liver dis\ufffeease. The Donor Risk Index (DRI) is a composite score\nof donor variables derived from 9,882 deceased LT\ndonors (April 1, 2002 to December 31, 2003) from the\nScientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) data\ufffebase [19]. Given limited donor information from chart\nreview, we used a modified composite score of variables\nthat were available and based on the DRI (donor age\n>60, partial/split-liver graft, cold ischemia time >8\nhours, stroke/cerebrovascular accident as principal\ndonor cause of death (either ischemic or hemorrhagic)).\nVariables\nOur primary exposure of interest was severity of organ\ndysfunction, as defined by the SOFA score, sequentially\nassessed after ICU admission [11]. For the LT cohort\n(objective 1; n = 198), the SOFA score was assessed at\nICU admission, at 48 hours after admission, and on the\nday of LT. For the eligible but non-LT cohort (objective\n2; n = 106), the SOFA score was assessed at ICU admis\ufffesion and at 48 hours after admission.\nData sources and collection\nData were extracted from patient medical records and\nexisting regional liver-transplant databases. Data fields\nabstracted included the etiology and complications of cir\uffferhosis, preoperative (admission, 48 hours, day of trans\ufffeplant, if applicable) hematologic, biochemical and\nphysiological/organ-dysfunction data (requirement for\nvasopressors, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement\ntherapy (RRT)), donor information, and outcomes after\nLT (see Table 1). Data were collected on medical comor\ufffebidities (modified CCI) when available. Patient outcomes\ncollected included surgical complications of transplant,\nduration of mechanical ventilation, duration of ICU/hos\ufffepital stay, need for postoperative RRT, and mortality.\nStatistical analysis\nFirst objective: predictors of 90-day mortality after liver\ntransplant (five sites)\nFor our first objective, our primary outcome was 90-day\nmortality among critically ill cirrhosis patients receiving LT.\nThe rationale for ascertainment of mortality at 90 days\nwas largely to reflect the early perioperative contributing\nfactors (severity of illness, donor characteristics) and to\navoid later confounding due to recurrent diseases, such\nas recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) or graft loss due to\nnoncompliance with immunosuppression. The main\ncovariates examined included age, sex, liver-disease\netiology, time of listing to and time from ICU admission\nto LT, decade of transplant, and graft/donor risk.\nIn the event of missing values, data were not replaced\nor estimated.

        "text": "(Continued from previous page)\nConclusions: In this cohort of critically ill patients, AKI incidence varied from 28 to 75%, depending on the method\nused of applying the KDIGO criteria. A tighter adherence to KDIGO definitions is warranted to decrease the\nheterogeneity of AKI and increase the comparability of future studies.\nKeywords: Acute kidney injury, Heterogeneity, Critically ill, Epidemiology, Mortality, Randomized controlled trials\nBackground\nAcute kidney injury (AKI) is a highly complex and com\ufffemon syndrome associated with increased mortality. A\nmyriad of ways to report the incidence of AKI has been\nproposed [1]. The first diagnostic criteria for AKI were\ncreated to reduce heterogeneity in reporting AKI and\noutcomes; the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney func\ufffetion, and End-stage kidney disease (RIFLE) classification\n[2], which were slightly updated into the Acute Kidney\nInjury Network (AKIN) classification [3]. The Kidney\nDisease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria\ncombine these and are currently recommended to assess\nAKI [4]. The KDIGO definition relies on three diagnos\ufffetic criteria: a rise in serum creatinine (sCr), a decrease in\nurine output (UO), and administration of renal replace\ufffement therapy (RRT) [4].\nDespite efforts to unify the diagnosis and reporting of\nAKI [5], recent literature has reported varying AKI inci\ufffedences and outcomes [6, 7]. Multiple ways of applying\nthe KDIGO criteria exist. Some limitations are inherent\nto the physiological basis of the criteria themselves. For\nexample, using sCr has its limitations, such as a delay in\nthe rise after an insult, and fluctuations according to\nfluid and nutritional status as well as muscle mass [8].\nMoreover, a baseline sCr value is required for the com\ufffeparison of sCr measurements during admission, which is\noften lacking in acutely admitted critically ill patients [9,\n10]. Various formulas to estimate baseline sCr exist,\nwhich lead to varying AKI incidences and misclassifica\ufffetion of AKI [9\u201313]. The criteria for UO are less fre\ufffequently used as it is challenging to collect hourly UO\ndata prospectively, and electronic health record data\nmay be unreliable [14]. Using only the sCr criteria, how\ufffeever, likely underestimates AKI incidence [15\u201317].\nBesides the limitations inherent to sCr and UO in crit\ufffeically ill patients, the KDIGO criteria are currently ap\ufffeplied in different ways leading to various incidences and\noutcomes, due to different interpretations but also using\nmodifications to KDIGO to fit the data available. For ex\ufffeample, the various formulas for baseline sCr and UO,\ncalculating the average UO per kilogram per hour using\na 6-h time interval is theoretically more sensitive for de\ufffetecting AKI compared to 24-h intervals [4].\nAKI is a significant clinical problem and at the core of\nmany ongoing research efforts. Randomized controlled\ntrials (RCTs) investigating different aspects of AKI in the\nlast 5 years have used various criteria as either inclusion\nor outcome definitions, and this may hamper the com\ufffeparison of these RCTs (Additional file 1: E-Table 1. Ex\ufffeamples of RCTs). A more standardized and therewith\nuniform approach towards applying KDIGO criteria may\naid in decreasing the variety in used definitions for AKI,\nto help further increase the comparability of future trials.\nIn this study, we aimed to investigate whether and how\ndifferent applications of methods affect AKI outcomes\ndepending on the options of handling (A) (baseline) sCr,\n(B) UO data, and (C) reported outcomes.\nMethods\nThe Simple Intensive Care Studies II (SICS-II) was a\nsingle-center, prospective observational study designed\nto evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of re\ufffepeated clinical examination and ultrasonography in crit\ufffeically ill patients (NCT03577405) [18].\nObjective\nThe primary objective of this post hoc analysis was to\nevaluate how the options for applying the KDIGO cri\ufffeteria influence the incidence of AKI.\nWe evaluated different options in terms of the use of",

In our study, we used the AKIN criteria instead of the Kidney \nDisease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria for two reasons. One reason is that most data in the \nMIMIC-III database were recorded before the publication of the KDIGO guideline15. Likewise, some other stud\ufffeies used the AKIN criteria for the same reason16. The other reason is that during the 7-day follow-up, confounding \nfactors, such as antibiotics and hospital infection, may interfere the kidney function, thus renal function was \nassessed and AKI was diagnosed within 48 hours after admission17. Because Scr values within 3 months before \nadmission were not recorded in the database, the first measurement of Scr within 24hours after admitted into \nICU was set as the baseline18.\nIncluded patients were those: (1) with first admission to ICU during hospital stays; (2) with AKI during \n48hours after admitted to ICU; (3) aged \u226518 years old and \u226489 years old; (4) were followed-up for 4 years by the \nCareVue system13. Patients without any RDW data within 24hours after admission or missing >5% indices were \nnot included in our study. Patients with hospitalization duration longer than 100 days were excluded19.\nData extraction. Data of each patient were extracted from the MIMIC-III database by the Structured Query \nLanguage, including age, sex, admission type, ethnicity, marriage, status of renal replacement therapy, RDW \nvalues, the survival time, days of hospital stay, and days of ICU stay (Additional File 1). If RDW was meas\ufffeured for several times within 24 hours after the ICU entry, data of the first time were used. Comorbidities were \ndefined as per the Implementation of the International Statistical Classification of Disease and Related Health \nProblems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) coding systems20. APS III21, the Modified Logistic Organ Dysfunction System \n(MLODS)22, SOFA23, the Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS)24 and the Systemic Inflammatory \nResponse Syndrome (SIRS) status25 were calculated according to the physiological and laboratory parameters in \nthe MIMIC-III database for estimation of prognosis in AKI patients. All methods were carried out in accordance \nwith relevant guidelines to protect the privacy of patients.\nGrouping. The data distribution of RDW in all the enrolled subjects was calculated; the lower tertile and the \nupper tertile were 13.6% and 15.2% respectively. We hence divided all of the subjects into three groups based on \nthe tertiles of RDW values26,27, namely the low RDW group (RDW<13.6%), the middle RDW group (13.6% \n\u2264 RDW<15.2%), and the high RDW group (RDW\u226515.2%). Thereafter, we divided patients into subgroups \naccording to AKI stages which are based on the AKIN guidelines14. In specific, AKI stage 1 was defined as AKI \nwith an increase of Scr values \u22651.5\u20131.9 folds or \u226526.5 \u03bcmol/L, or urine output <0.5 ml/(kg\u2219h) for more than \n6hours; AKI stage 2 was defined as AKI with an increase of Scr values \u22652.0\u20132.9 folds or urine output to <0.5ml/\n(kg\u2219h) for more than 12 hours; AKI stage 3 was defined as AKI with an increase of Scr values \u2265 3.0 folds or",
