Ann Cardiothorac Surg 2020;9(1):1-9 | http://dx.doi.org/10.21037/acs.2020.01.02\nIntroduction\nWhile lung transplantation (LTx) for patients with end\ufffestage pulmonary disease can be a life-saving measure, the \nscarcity of suitable donor lungs results in up to 30% of these \npatients dying while on the waiting list (1,2). Obtaining \ndonor organs for LTx is particularly problematic, with \ndonors of at least one other solid organ only having suitable \nlungs in 15\u201330% of cases according to current assessment \ncriteria (3-5). End-of-life care, be it in the intensive care \nunit or otherwise, often results in damage to potential grafts \nand even under optimal donor circumstances, brain death \nstill has the deleterious effect of causing neurogenic edema \nand a cytokine storm-induced inflammatory response (6). \nStandard transplant protocols developed and refined \nsince the 1960\u2019s involve infusion of the donor lung with \na specially formulated perfusate before inflation of the \nlung, stapling of the trachea, and cold preservation until \ntransplantation (7). In contrast, ex-vivo lung perfusion \n(EVLP) involves continuous ventilation and perfusion of \ndonor lungs, offering the potential to both extend the ability \nto functionally assess grafts, as well as recondition them \nto a transplant-suitable standard, thereby expanding the \navailable pool of grafts (8). EVLP can be administered via \nseveral different established protocols which vary perfusate \ncomposition, flow, temperature, pressure, and ventilation, \nwith off-the-shelf EVLP equipment such as the \u201cXVIVO \nPerfusion System (XPS)\u201d, \u201cOrgan Care System (OCS)\u201d, \nand \u201cVivoline LS-1\u201d now on the market (1).\nWhile extended-criteria lungs have been shown to \nhave comparable follow-up survival outcomes to standard \ncriteria lungs using standard lung transplant methods, the \nuse of EVLP to further expand the donor pool raises the \nquestion of EVLP recipient long-term outcomes (3,8,9). \nThe objective of this meta-analysis was to aggregate mid\ufffeto long-term survival data and available post-operative \noutcomes from studies comparing LTx recipients who \nreceived EVLP treated grafts to those receiving standard \nprotocol (cold-preservation) grafts.\nMethods\nLiterature search\nTen medical literature databases were queried from their \ndates of inception to August 2019. These included Medline, \nEmbase, PubMed, and the Ovid \u201cEvidence-Based Medicine \nReviews\u201d collection, which includes the Cochrane databases, \nas well as national college and government repositories. A \nbroad search strategy was deliberately used, using terms \n\u201cex-vivo lung perfusion\u201d (as a whole term and individually) \nand \u201cEVLP\u201d.\nTwo independent researchers (P.F. and B.M.) screened \nreference list results and full texts, with inclusion at each \nstage determined by consensus with the senior researcher \n(A.C.). Studies were included if they were comparative \nstudies reporting primary mid- to long-term outcome data \nfor recipients after lung transplant using standard protocol \nor EVLP.

The \nreference list of all included studies was examined to identify \nfurther articles meeting the inclusion criteria.\nThe primary endpoint was overall Kaplan-Meier survival \nreported to at least 6-months. Secondary endpoints were \ndetermined as those reported in at least half of included \nstudies and included 30-day mortality, post-operative graft \ndysfunction grade 3 at 72 h, intensive care unit length of \nstay (LOS), and hospital LOS.\nQuality analysis\nA 19-point metric adopted from the Canadian Institute",

Ex-vivo lung perfusion \n(EVLP) offers the ability to expand the number of useable lung grafts through assessment and reconditioning \nof explanted lungs, particularly those not initially meeting criteria for transplantation. This meta-analysis \naimed to examine the mid- to long-term survival and other short-term outcomes of patients transplanted \nwith EVLP-treated lungs versus standard/cold-storage protocol lungs.\nMethods: Literature search of ten medical databases was conducted for original studies involving \u201cex-vivo \nlung perfusion\u201d and \u201cEVLP\u201d. Included articles were assessed by two independent researchers, survival data \nfrom Kaplan-Meier curves digitized, and individual patient data imputed to conduct aggregated survival \nanalysis. Meta-analyses of suitably reported outcomes were conducted using a random-effects model.\nResults: Thirteen studies met inclusion criteria, with a total of 407 EVLP lung transplants and 1,765 as \nper standard/cold storage protocol. One study was a randomized controlled trial while the remainder were \nsingle-institution cohort series of varying design. The majority of donor lungs were from brain death donors, \nwith EVLP lungs having significantly worse PaO2/FiO2 ratio and significantly greater rate of abnormal \nchest X-ray. Aggregated survival analysis of all included studies revealed no significant survival difference for \nEVLP or standard protocol lungs (hazard ratio 1.00; 95% confidence interval: 0.79\u20131.27, P=0.981). Survival \nat 12, 24, and 36 months for the EVLP cohort was 84%, 79%, and 74%, respectively. Survival at 12, 24, and \n36 months for the standard protocol cohort was 85%, 79%, and 73%, respectively. Meta-analysis did not find \na significant difference in risk of 30-day mortality or primary graft dysfunction grade 3 at 72 hours between \ncohorts. \nConclusions: There was no significant difference in mid- to long-term survival of EVLP lung transplant \npatients when compared to standard protocol donor lungs. The incidence of 30-day mortality and primary \ngraft dysfunction grade 3 at 72 hours did not differ significantly between groups. EVLP offers the potential \nto increase lung donor utilization while providing similar short-term outcomes and mid- to long-term \nsurvival.\nKeywords: Ex-vivo lung perfusion (EVLP); lung transplantation; meta-analysis; survival\nSubmitted Dec 31, 2019.

        "text": "Introduction\nAlthough lung transplantation is the only definitive treatment available for end-stage lung dis\ufffeeases, this option remains critically limited by the shortage of available donor lungs [1]. Novel\nstrategies, including organ donation after circulatory death (DCD) [2], and the implementa\ufffetion of ex-vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) [3], have recently emerged to overcome such shortage.\nEVLP was initially developed to assess the function and the potential for transplantation of\nDCD lungs [4, 5], and its use has been then extended to other forms of \u201cnon standard\u201d donor\nlungs [3]. EVLP has also been proposed as a platform to deliver drugs ex vivo (concept of phar\ufffemacological reconditioning) [6], in order to improve the status of the donor lung and to\nreduce the risk of primary graft dysfunction (PGD), a severe form of lung ischemia and reper\ufffefusion injury (LIR) which may develop early after transplantation [7]. In line with this concept,\nwe recently provided evidence, in an experimental model of EVLP of DCD lungs, that such\nlungs could be significantly reconditioned by the ex vivo administration of drugs interfering\nwith oxidative processes associated with LIR [8].\nA critical pathogenic mechanism of LIR and PGD relies in the rapid activation of innate\nimmune mechanisms responsible for the establishment of an early non specific inflammatory\nresponse in the graft [9]. This response is characterized by the upregulated expression of\ninflammatory cytokines / chemokines, and the stimulated trafficking of activated leukocytes\nwithin the transplanted organ [9]. A crucial step in triggering such response relies in the acti\ufffevation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-\u03baB), a master regulator of in\ufffeflammation activated in response to the engagement of immune receptors belonging to the\ninterleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R)/Toll-like receptor (TLR) superfamily [10]. Accordingly, phar\ufffemacological inhibitors of NF-\u03baB could have potential therapeutic activity in LIR and PGD\nafter lung transplantation [11]. In an earlier study, Ross et al. reported that the selective NF\ufffe\u03baB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) reduced lung edema and improved lung\nfunction following lung transplantation in a porcine model [12]. This observation raises the\nhypothesis that PDTC could be a potential candidate drug for the ex-vivo treatment of dam\ufffeaged, non standard lung grafts. In the present work, we addressed this hypothesis by assessing\nthe effects of PDTC administered during EVLP, in damaged rat lungs obtained after circula\ufffetory death and extended warm ischemic time.\nMaterials and methods\nAnimals\nFifteen male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 300 to 350g (Charles River Laboratory, L\u2019Arbresle,\nFrance) were used in this study. All the animals received humane care in compliance with\nthe \u2019Principles of Laboratory Animal Care\u2019 formulated by the National Society for Medical\nResearch and the \u2019Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\u2019 prepared by the Institute\nof Laboratory Animal Resources and published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH Pub\ufffelication No. 86-23, revised 1996).

For this reason, it has been suggested that physiolog\ufffeical variables such as compliance, airway pressure, and vascular resistance may be more useful\nthan oxygenation to evaluate graft function during EVLP [48, 49].\nOur study has some limitations. Firstly, we did not include a control group of normal lungs\nundergoing EVLP to determine the intrinsic effects of EVLP in the absence of warm ischemia.\nHowever, it is here worth to mention that in our recent study [8], we showed that lungs not\nexposed to warm ischemia (but simply to cold preservation) disclosed no significant lung dam\ufffeage and edema, while showing remarkable physiological stability throughout EVLP, implying\nthat EVLP itself does not produce significant alterations. Secondly, lungs treated during EVLP\nwere not transplanted. Therefore, the significant improvement of injured lungs by PDTC\nnoted during EVLP cannot be translated to transplantated lungs, and this issue will clearly\nrequire further in vivo transplantation studies. Thirdly, we did not perform histological analy\ufffeses to evaluate the actions of PDTC on lung morphology, nor did we perform any cell counts\nand cellular analyses in the BAL fluid. However, it must be underscored that the key morpho\ufffelogical consequence of lung reperfusion injury and inflammation is the infiltration of alveolar\nspaces by blood leukocytes. Owing to the acellular perfusate used in our study, such infiltration\ncannot be evaluated [8], although we cannot rule out the presence of resident lung cells, in\ufffecluding some leukocytes. This issue will also require further in vivo studies. Finally, as we com\ufffeputed the weight gain of the heart-lung blocks as an index of lung edema, we cannot formally\nrule out some contribution of changes in heart weight in our observations. In this respect,\ncomparing the lung dry/wet weight ratio of the groups at the end of experiments would have\nbeen more accurate.\nIn conclusion, our study indicates that the NF-\u03baB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate,\nadministered during ex-vivo perfusion of injured rat lungs obtained after circulatory death,\nmarkedly alleviates pulmonary inflammation and edema, thereby preventing physiological\ndeterioration. Therefore, pharmacological therapy with PDTC during EVLP may be useful for\nthe rehabilitation of damaged donor lungs before transplantation.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceptualization: LL TK LP.\nData curation: CF XW RP JL.\nFormal analysis: CF XW RP FG JL.\nFunding acquisition: LL TK PE HBR.\nInvestigation: CF XW RP JP EA JL.\nMethodology: LL TK FG XW RP.\nProject administration: LL TK HBR.\nResources: LL TK PE HBR.\nSupervision: LL TK LP FG.\nValidation: TK LL.\nVisualization: CF XW RP.\nWriting \u2013 original draft: CF LL TK.\nWriting \u2013 review & editing: LL TK LP FG.\nPyrrolidine dithiocarbamate treatment during experimental ex-vivo lung perfusion\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0173916 March 21, 2017 12 / 15",

Furthermore, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 levels measured in the\nperfusate during EVLP were reported to inversely correlate with\nthe recipient oxygenation 24 h post-transplantation (135).\nInterestingly, given the observation that perfusate IL-1\u03b2 and\nTNF-\u03b1 at 30 min during EVLP were effective markers for\ndifferentiating between in-hospital survival and non-survival\npost-transplant, blocking the IL-1\u03b2 pathway during EVLP\nmight reduce endothelial activation and subsequent neutrophil\nadhesion on reperfusion (136).\nIMMUNOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF\n(MARGINAL) ORGANS DURING MACHINE\nPERFUSION\nThe definition of marginal organs per se is a rather arbitrary one.\nThe most commonly used is the dichotomy between standard\ncriteria (SCD) and extended criteria donors (ECD), which is\nsimply discriminated by age and three donor criteria for the DBD\n(and, increasingly, DCD) kidney cohort (13, 137, 138). However,\nin clinical routine, it is not always straightforward to decide if an\norgan is within \u201cstandard criteria,\u201d as there are plethora of factors\ninterfering with organ quality, i.e., estimated duration of CIT,\n(functional) WIT, or the grade of steatosis in liver and pancreas,\njust to mention a few.\nWhen we focus on the donor age only, a vast amount of\nliterature exists. There is evidence that the immunogenicity\nof elderly organs is increased, as it is believed that aging in\ncombination with injuries (i.e., brain death) induces a pro\ufffeinflammatory environment, which could lead to an activation\nof innate and adaptive immune responses (139\u2013141). Aging\ninfluences cellular repair mechanisms, and it is known that\nthe number of MHC molecules present on the cellular\nsurface is increased by aged parenchymal cells (139). In\nexperimental studies, transplantation of elderly organs was\nassociated with a more powerful early immune response\ncompared to transplantation of younger ones. Recipients of\nsuch old grafts presented with a higher concentration of\neffector/memory T-cells with an increased alloreactivity, leading\nto acute rejection, which results in a particular high burden\nof damage for the older donor organ (140). Elderly organs do\nnot have the same repair mechanism capabilities, so the clinical\ndamage of acute rejection leaves a more severe defect, explaining\nthe increased rates of DGF and/or graft loss in this donor\ncohort (140, 142).\nAn alteration of immunogenicity in aging organs could be\none reason to focus on preservation techniques (143) such\nas HMP and NMP to learn more about the process or even\nto (re-)condition an organ for reperfusion in the recipient.\nDue to the fact that the reconstitution of a near-physiological\nenvironment might work best to study immune cells, the\nfollowing paragraphs will bring NMP into focus.\nHuman organs are equipped with a sophisticated resident\nimmune system. The kidney, for example, not only hosts tissue\uffferesident macrophages (144); the organ also harbors lymphocytes,\ninnate lymphoid cells, natural killer (NK) cells, natural killer T\n(NKT) cells, and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells (145). The residential immune cells\nof human organs remain in a balanced homeostatic state unless\nthey are stimulated\u2014by the insult of brain death in an organ\ndonor, for example\u2014when an immunological activation might be\ninduced. Such a response to a significant injury like brain death in\nan organ donor includes both local and systemic inflammation,\ncomprising cellular infiltrates and a cytokine storm (146).\nWith the current gold-standard preservation technologies such\nas SCS, the organs will be transplanted unchanged, in an\nimmunologically activated status, into recipients in whom\nalloantigens will trigger another immune response immediately\nafter reperfusion, presented by donor-derived antigen presenting\ncells to recipient T cells (147, 148). How important donor\ufffederived leukocytes are in the allorecognition and rejection\nprocesses was demonstrated by Lechler and Batchelor years",
