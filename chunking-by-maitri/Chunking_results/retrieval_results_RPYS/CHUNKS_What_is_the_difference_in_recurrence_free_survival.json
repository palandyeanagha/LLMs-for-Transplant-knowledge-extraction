Lung Metastasectomy of HCC in Liver Transplant\nFIGURE 1 | Cumulative survival (1, 3, and 5 year) of the 25 patients enrolled in the study after hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence following liver transplantation.\nDISCUSSION\nThis is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, to specifically\nevaluate the impact and management of lung metastases in\nHCC recurrence after LT. We observed a low occurrence of\ncomplications, no surgery-related mortality and a good feasibility\nof surgery in those patients judged operable after first RPM\nwhenever HCC recurred in lung. We observed that the majority\nof recurrences were in the right lower lobe. This is probably due\nto the proximity of this site to the liver at the time of hepatectomy\nand to the lymphatic drainage. Finally, we detected good long\ufffeterm survival outcomes, with a 1-, 3-, and 5 year cumulative\nprobability of OS from recurrence of 100%, 66% (95%CI 44\u201388)\nand 43% (95%CI 12\u201374), respectively, and a median OS of 51\nmonths (95%CI 24\u201378).\nOur study would have a great impact in the setting of LT for\nHCC, since the second most common site of HCC recurrence is\nthe lung. Whenever the lesions were limited to the lung, we were\nable to show that complete resection can be safely performed,\nwhich may have contributed to the long-term survival of these\npatients, while some reviews advocated more aggressive surgical\nintervention (5, 6). This is of great importance, since tumor\nrecurrence would have obviously decreased the opportunity of\nlong-term survival after LT for HCC (6, 15). To the best of\nour knowledge, only few reports of resection for pulmonary\nmetastasis from HCC after liver transplantation are available\n(15, 16, 18\u201322). In particular, Bates et al. (16) reported five\ncases of metastatic HCC resection after liver transplantation, with\na survival period of 44 months after LT and 28 months after\npulmonary resection.\nFinally, our results in terms of OS are comparable to those of\npatients following metastasectomy after liver resection for HCC\nin patients without history of LT (14, 23\u201325).\nAlthough prognostic indicators are not known, several\nclinical or pathological factors have been published (14, 23, 26,\n27). Generally, patient selection and metastasis characteristics\n(such as number and side of lesions) are indispensable for\na surgery survival benefit. In additional, good liver function\nmight be essential for better survival (28, 29). As confirmation\nof this, in our study population was well-selected (only lung\nmetastasis) with a good liver function (no patients with\ndecompensated disease).\nAfter the metastasectomy, recurrence may be managed by a\nrepeated metastasectomy (23, 30\u201332). In our series, 4 patients\n(3 cases for recurrence, once case to complete the resection)\nunderwent to a second pulmonary resection for a recurrent PM\ufffeHCC after a metastasectomy. Multiple metastases or repeated\nmetastasectomies are not risk factors for long-term survival, as\nshown in this and previous studies (31, 33), although patients\nwith a single metastasis or single pulmonary surgery might show\nbetter survival (23, 26).\nLimitations of our study are: the retrospective design, the\nlack of a control arm and the limited number of patients. The\nimpact of surgical access on outcome cannot be assessed, due to\nthe limited number of patients. However, the study has several\nstrengths: this is the largest consecutive series of patients affected\nby lung HCC-metastasis treated surgery in the post-transplant\nsetting. Moreover, despite the retrospective design of the study,\nthe cohort is homogeneous regarding the baseline features and\nthe patient management.\nIn conclusion, selected patients without intrahepatic HCC\uffferecurrence after LT and with preserved hepatic function showed\nthat a pulmonary metastasectomy could be efficacious in\nmanaging a PM-HCC and could give an opportunity for long\ufffeterm survival.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe datasets generated for this study are available on request to",

        "text": "Background\nIn 1996, Mazzaferro et al. reported that when liver trans\ufffeplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was re\ufffestricted to patients with early-stage disease (defined as a\nsingle tumor less than 5 cm in diameter, or up to three\ntumors less than 3 cm in diameter, without vascular in\ufffevasion or extrahepatic metastasis), the 4-year survival\nrate was 75%, similar to survival rates for patients with\nnon-HCC liver disease [1]. These criteria, which were\nsoon termed the \u201cMilan criteria,\u201d became the worldwide\nbenchmark for liver transplantation criteria for HCC.\nThe Milan criteria, limiting the indications for liver\ntransplantation for HCC, have reduced the postoperative\nrecurrence rate of HCC. However, HCC still recurs in\n1.6\u201313% of recipients within the Milan criteria after liver\ntransplantation [1\u20136]. There have been many reports of\ncases with multiple instances of recurrence due to sys\ufffetemic recurrence caused by extra-hepatic circulating\ntumor cells. The prognosis after recurrence of HCC is\npoor, with reported median survival ranging from 9 to\n19 months in major transplant centers in both Western\nand Eastern countries [4, 7\u201312]. However, if the recur\uffference remains local, such as within the liver, lung, or ad\uffferenal gland, surgical resection may improve prognosis,\nand cases of long-term survival have been reported [4,\n6\u20138, 10, 11, 13]. Here, we report a case of long-term sur\ufffevival after resection of the pharyngeal metastasis due to\nHCC recurrence after living-donor liver transplantation\n(LDLT).\nCase presentation\nA 47-year-old man with a Model End-stage Liver Dis\ufffeease (MELD) score of 11 and liver cirrhosis associated\nwith hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection underwent LDLT\nfor HCC, with his 48-year-old elder brother as the living\ndonor, in November 2004. He had received transarterial\nchemoembolization (TACE) 5 months before liver trans\ufffeplantation and was assessed as having a partial response\naccording to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria\nin Solid Tumors (mRECIST) [14]. The patient had no\nhistory of other diseases, and there were also no diseases\nof note in his family history. The right lobe of the donor\nwas harvested and weighed 710 g (graft-to-recipient\nweight ratio, 1.09). The donor and recipient had the\nsame blood type. Preoperative abdominal computed\ntomography (CT) revealed liver cirrhosis with three\nhypervascular nodules, diagnosed as HCC, which were\n2.0, 2.5, and 2.8 cm in diameter and met the Milan cri\ufffeteria (Fig. 1a).

Among these patients, 36 underwent\nSLT after primary liver curative resection due to intrahepatic recurrence. During the same period, one hundred and forty\ufffeseven patients with HCC within Milan criteria underwent primary OLT (PLTW group), the intra-operative and post-operative\nparameters were compared between these two groups. Furthermore, we compared tumor recurrence and patient survival\nof patients with SLT to 156 patients with HCC beyond Milan criteria (PLTB group). Cox Hazard regression was made to\nidentify the risk factors for tumor recurrence.\nResults: The median interval between initial liver resection and SLT was 35 months (1\u201363 months). The intraoperative blood\nloss (P,0.05) and transfusion volume (P,0.05) were larger in the SLT group than in the PLTW group. The operation time\nwas longer in the SLT group (P,0.05). The post-operative complications incidence, tumor recurrence rate, patients\u2019 survival\nrate, and tumor-free survival rate were comparable between these two groups (all P.0.05).

Liver transplantation is an optimal \ntreatment option for early stage, unresectable \nhepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis \nbecause it treats the underlying cirrhosis as well as \nhepatocellular carcinoma and is associated with a \nsignificantly reduced incidence of recurrent cancer \ncompared with alternative treatment strategies. Liver \ntransplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma within \nthe Milan criteria (one lesion between 3 and 5 cm, or \ntwo to three lesions between 1 and 3 cm) has been \nlong established as the standard criteria for patient \nselection.65 Based on the success of the Milan criteria, \nadditional proposals to allow access for patients \nwith larger tumors have been developed. The most \nwell known of these are the University of California, \nSan Francisco (UCSF) criteria (81% survival at five \nyears), up-to-seven criteria (71% survival at five \nyears), total tumor volume (75% survival at four \nyears), extended Toronto criteria (68% survival at \nfive years), and Kyoto criteria (65% survival at five \nyears).66-70 Each proposal expands the selection \ncriteria, allowing more patients to be considered for \nliver transplantation, while showing reduced but \nexcellent long term outcomes after transplantation.\nThe primary limitation of liver transplantation \nfor hepatocellular carcinoma is the critical shortage \nof available liver allografts, and thus the patient\u2019s \nsurvival without timely access to transplantation as \nwell as the expected survival after transplantation \nmust be considered, which is best estimated \nby disease burden.

Little is known about outcomes for SLT in patients with recurrent HCC within\nUniversity of California San Francisco (UCSF) criteria after liver resection (LR).\nMethods: Between January 2001 and December 2011, 380 patients with HCC meeting UCSF criteria, 200 of which were\nresected (LR group) from a perspective of SLT in case of recurrence, and 180 directly underwent LT (PLT). We compared\npatient characteristics, perioperative and long-term outcomes between SLT and PLT groups. We also assessed the outcome\nof LR and PLT groups.\nResults: Among the 200 patients in LR group, 86 (43%) developed HCC recurrence and 15/86 (17%) of these patients\npresented HCC recurrence outside UCSF criteria. Only 39 of the 86 patients underwent SLT, a transplantation rate of 45% of\npatients with HCC recurrence. Compared with PLT group, LR group showed lower overall survival rate (P = 0.005) and higher\nrecurrence rate (P = 0.006). Although intraoperative blood loss and required blood transfusion were more frequent in SLT\ngroup, the perioperative mortality and posttransplant complications were similar in SLT and PLT groups. The overall survival\nand recurrence rates did not significantly differ between the two groups. When stratifying by graft type in the SLT group,\noverall survival and recurrence rates did not significantly differ between deceased donor LT (DDLT) and living donor LT\n(LDLT) groups. In the subgroup analysis by MC, similar results were observed between patients with recurrent HCC meeting\nMC and patients with recurrent HCC beyond MC but within UCSF criteria.\nConclusion: Our single institution experience demonstrated that prior hepatectomy and SLT for recurrent HCC within UCSF\ncriteria was feasible and SLT could achieve the same outcome as PLT.\nCitation: Liu F, Wei Y, Wang W, Chen K, Yan L, et al.

The 1 and 5 year cumulative probability of OS from recurrence were 100 and\n43% (95%CI 12\u201374), respectively, with a median OS of 51 months (95%CI 24\u201378).\nConclusion: Selected patients with isolated pulmonary HCC-recurrence after LT and\nwith preserved hepatic function showed that a pulmonary metastasectomy could be\nefficacious in managing a PM-HCC and could give an opportunity for long-term survival.\nKeywords: hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation, recurrence, pulmonary metastases, pulmonary\nresection\nINTRODUCTION\nLiver transplantation (LT) is a validated treatment for\nhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (1, 2). The risk of HCC\nrecurrence varies between 8 and 20% depending on pre\ufffetransplant-variables such as the tumor burden and the\nalpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level (3\u20137). Moreover, HCC recurrence\nafter LT is an accepted and not exceptional clinical challenge\n(8). In fact, it reduces LT curative intention, being the survival\nreduced as low as 3.3 months when only best supportive care is\noffered (9). Surveillance and administration of HCC recurrence\nafter LT is exciting and complicated. More frequently, recurrence\noccurs within the first 2 years (10), although cases of very late\nrecurrence after a 10 year period have been reported (11, 12).\nRegarding the sites of HCC recurrence, the first revelation\nis more frequently extra-hepatic (as high as 71%), followed\nby intra-hepatic and simultaneously intra- and extra-hepatic\n(13). In addition, intra- or extrahepatic recurrence, or the\ncombination of both, did not result in different outcomes.\nAmong the extrahepatic sites of recurrence, the lung is the\nmost frequent metastatic site (5). Pulmonary metastases resection\n(PMR) for HCC improves survival in patients treated by\nliver resection or ablative procedures (14). Although some\ninvestigators recommend PMR also for HCC recurrence after\nLT (15, 16), in this setting the impact on survival is unclear\nand today pulmonary metastases for HCC (PM-HCC) after LT\nare infrequently resected due to their multiplicity and multi\ufffeorgan involvement.\nTo give new lights on this issue, we report the experience of\nthree Italian LT Centers regarding pulmonary metastasectomy\nfor HCC after LT in terms of safety, complication, risk of\nrecurrence, and survival.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nStudy Design, Patients, and Endpoints\nThis is a retrospective evaluation of a cohort of prospectively\nenrolled patients in three different Liver Transplant Centers\nin Italy (two in Milan and one in Padua). All consecutive\nHCC transplanted patients, who developed PM-HCC, as first\nmetastasis, from 2008 to 2018 were included in this study\nwhenever treated with lung surgery resection. The database\nwas locked in June 2019. Baseline corresponded to first HCC\nrecurrence after LT with lung metastases. Each patient signed a\nwritten informed consent in conformity with the ethic committee\nand the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki, as\nupdated in 2004.\nA contrast-enhanced thoraco-abdominal computed\ntomography (CT)-scan was performed every 6 months for\nthe first 5 years, and then annually in all HCC transplanted\npatients. Serum AFP was quantified every 3 months during the\nfirst year and every 6 months thereafter. In case of suspected HCC\nrecurrence, biopsy was performed when the site of recurrence\nis reachable. Otherwise, the diagnosis was obtained by imaging\nassociated with AFP levels increase. Once the diagnosis was\nobtained, surgery treatment was performed whenever judged\nappropriate, with a curative or palliative intent. For the analysis,\ntreatments were considered with a curative intent if the removal\nof the neoplastic lesion led the patient HCC-free.\nOnce the diagnosis was obtained, in one of the three centers\nsorafenib was started as soon as became available and its use\nsafe (i.e., after healing of surgical wound in surgical patients)\nand mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (mTORi)-",

Overall Survival and Recurrence Free Survival Rate of the New Hepatic Resection Criteria. The 5-year \nsurvival rate for the new hepatic resection criteria (up-to-seven criteria, albumin level \u226535 g/L, and alpha-fetoprotein \nlevel <100 \u00b5g/L) was 81.4% (Figure 3a) and the 5-year recurrence-free survival rate was 24.7% (Figure 3b).\nIn this study, we used various liver transplantation \ncriteria to determine the criteria for resection of \nintermediate-stage HCC. These criteria consisted of \ndifferent combinations of tumor size, number, and \nmalignant potential. When these criteria are exceeded, the \ndisease is considered to have become systemic. Similarly, \nKudo et al., (2015) and Yamakado et al., (2014) evaluated \nthe criteria for molecular targeted drugs and TACE not by \ntumor number or size alone, but in combination. Therefore, \nthe up-to-seven criteria (a combination of these factors), \nare an important indicator for intermediate-stage HCC. \nIn addition, tumor number and tumor size were examined \nin multivariate analyses. As a result, only albumin level \n\u226535 g/L and AFP level <100 \u00b5g/L were significantly \nprognostic. Since the up-to-seven criteria contain these \noverlapping factors (tumor number and size), they were \nnot included in multivariate analysis.\nThe main points of this paper are that the up-to-seven \ncriteria (the combination of tumor size and number), AFP \nlevel as malignant potential, and albumin level as liver \nfunction can be used to select patients with intermediate \nFigure 4.
