        "text": "Background\nThere has been a progressive increase worldwide in the\nnumber of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD)\nwho require kidney transplantation. As a result, many\ntransplantation programs have been forced to recruit\nmore cadaveric and living donors [1, 2]. In many coun\ufffetries, living related donors are still the main source of\nkidneys for transplantation due to the poor legal defin\ufffeition and deficient organization required for a cadaver\ndonor work-up [1, 2] and by the fact that recipient and\ngraft survival rates with living donors have consistently\nbeen higher than the rates achieved with cadaver donors\n[3]. Once a suitable living donor has been found, it is ne\ufffecessary to ensure that the donor has two properly func\ufffetioning kidneys and that renal function is evenly divided\nbetween them. The battery of tests for the preoperative\nevaluation of potential live-kidney donors is currently\nconsidered adequate for detecting or suspecting any\nfunctional or anatomical renal abnormality but does not\ninclude prior genetic tests. Performing a uninephrect\ufffeomy in living related donors without first conducting\ngenetic studies could, however, accelerate the progres\ufffesion of pre-existing occult primary renal disease [4, 5] in\nboth the recipient and donor.\nAmyloidosis due to familial Mediterranean fever\n(FMF) can lead to ESRD, culminating in kidney trans\ufffeplantation for some patients [6]. Amyloidosis can de\ufffevelop in patients who have never experienced clinical\nsymptoms of FMF (known as phenotype 2) [6, 7]. Sur\ufffeprisingly, there are currently no available data regarding\nthe clinical outcomes of living relative donors who carry\namyloidosis due to FMF. This report is, to our know\ufffeledge, the first case of FMF and unrecognized renal\namyloidosis in both donor and recipient after living\nrelated kidney transplantation involving a pair of broth\ufffeers with the same homozygous MEFV gene mutation\n(p.M694I/p.M694I). We discuss the current evidence on\nthis topic and summarize the exceptional experience of\ntwo FMF patients with severe FMF mutations and di\ufffevided renal mass, who had renal amyloidosis and were\nsuccessfully treated with colchicine and anakinra.\nCase presentation\nPatient population\nRecipient\nA 31-year-old man, originally from Morocco, was admit\ufffeted to Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC, The\nNetherlands) complaining of leg edema in February 2000.\nThe patient had a history of recurrent episodes of inflam\ufffemation, fever and serositis. The patient was diagnosed\nwith nephrotic syndrome due to amyloidosis secondary to\nFMF. His family had 7 siblings with consanguineous par\ufffeents. At that time, no genetic mutations were found. After\nanother episode of FMF in 2009, the patient presented\nwith renal failure and nephrotic syndrome that did not re\ufffespond to conservative therapy (angiotensin-converting-en\ufffezyme inhibitors, diuretics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory\ndrugs, cyclosporine and colchicine). He was suspected not\nto be compliant with treatment. A bilateral nephrectomy\nwas performed to halt the progressive catabolism due to\nunrestrained renal protein loss. The patient, a Dutch resi\ufffedent, required chronic dialysis. At this time, there was no\nevidence of clinical cardiac involvement by amyloidosis. In\n2011, he received a left kidney transplant from his elder\nbrother, a resident of Spain, who had no medical history\nof note (the preoperative evaluation of his clinical status\nand renal function were unremarkable). The kidney\ndonation and transplantation were performed in the\nNetherlands. The recipient received a standard im\ufffemunosuppression protocol (cyclosporine, mycopheno\ufffelic acid and prednisolone). After transplantation, the\nrecipient\u2019s postoperative course was unsatisfactory,\nwith a 10% decrease in serum creatinine levels on 3\nconsecutive days during the first postoperative week.\nHis renal function subsequently improved, although\nslowly, and he developed massive proteinuria (18 g/",

        "text": "PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED\nThe LDLT is being established as a general medical\ntreatment of various kinds of end-stage liver diseases.\nOn the other hand, it is thought that the original disease\nrecurrence such as hepatitis C and HCC has influenced\na significant decline in the survival rate of adult cases.\nMoreover, the living donor\u2019s mortality and need of LTx\ndue to a postoperative hepatic insufficiency raised a\ncritical social concern in Europe and the United States.\nAlso in Japan, a living donor\u2019s death was reported in\nMay 2003(5). It is necessary to reevaluate the donor\u2019s\nselection standard and safety anew because of the\nexperience of a donor\u2019s morbidity and mortality. The\nfollowing critical problems remain which should be\nurgently solved: 1) graft size mismatching, 2) ABO\nblood-type incompatible transplantation, 3) the expan\ufffesion of LDLT indication to HCC, 4) the relapse of hepa\ufffetitis C, 5) marginal donors, and 6) the freedom from\nthe immunosuppressants.\n1. Graft size mismatching\nThe minimally required quantity of graft volume has\nnot been fully clarified, which is one of the biggest issues\nof the adult-to-adult LDLT. The following two methods\nexist to express the graft volume : 1) the ratio of graft\nvolume (GV) in the standard liver volume (SLV) of re\ufffecipient, which is calculated by the recipient\u2019s height\nand body weight, and 2) the ratio of graft weight in the\nrecipient\u2019s weight (GRWR ; graft to recipient weight\nratio). The safe limit of small-for-size graft is reported\nto be set from 30% to 40% in GV/SLV(6, 7), while from\n0.6 to 0.8% in GRWR (8, 9). To increase the graft vol\ufffeume, a left lobe graft with a caudate lobe is often used\n(10 -12). As an alternative, an APOLT (auxiliary partial\northotopic liver transplantation) was applied in those\nwho deviate from this safe limit of the graft volume\n(13). From the beginning, the APOLT was expected\nto play a role in providing temporary support for trans\ufffeplant patients with fulminant hepatitis while they were\nwaiting for the regeneration of the native liver. However,\nthis was not generalized from the difficult hepatectomy\nof a morbid liver and possible disease transmission\nfrom the preserved native liver to a new liver graft.\nIn order to conquer this problem (small-for-size graft),\nthe right lobe graft which occupies about two thirds\nof the liver has been frequently used. Herein, the patho\ufffephysiology and cause-oriented strategy are described\nabout a small-for-size graft or a large-for-size graft.\na) Small-for-size graft\nThe patient, who received a small-for-size graft, ex\ufffehibited persistent functional hyperbilirubinemia, in\ufffetractable ascites, graft dysfunction leading to serious\nconditions such as gastrointestinal bleeding and renal\nfailure. (14-16) The characteristic histological findings\nare as follows: hepatocellular ballooning, fatty degen\ufffeeration, hemorrhagic necrosis, and cholestasis around\nthe central vein so called zone 3. We have advocated\nthe following mechanisms for the small-for-size graft :\n1) superfluous portal blood flow, 2) insufficient hepatic\nvenous drainage, 3) absolute shortage of functional\nliver mass, and 4) inappropriate intragraft responses,\nas shown in Fig.4. Against the superfluous portal flow,\nwhich causes sinusoidal endothelial injury immediately\nafter reperfusion (17, 18), the reduction of portal pressure\nor portal flow by splenectomy, splenic artery ligation\n(19-21), or a porto-systemic shunting (22, 23) was rec\ufffeommended. To counteract the insufficient hepatic ve\ufffenous outflow, the venoplasty in a left lobe graft or aggres\ufffesive reconstruction of the venous tributaries from the\nmiddle hepatic vein is performed to prevent graft con\ufffegestion, one of the key factors for a successful outcome\n(Fig. 5)(11, 24). The 3-dimensional computed tomogra\ufffephy(3D-CT) is useful to assess the congestion area\nin the graft prior to operation (Fig. 6).

        "text": "6. Risks and benefits to transplant recipients\nAs has been discussed in several other reports, the attributable risk\nof immunosuppression on the development and severity of COVID-19 is\nunknown. Current knowledge is mainly based on recently published\ncase reports [16\u201320]. Previous reports on transplant recipient outcome\nfor other respiratory viruses and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome\nare contradictory [21,22] and several immunosuppressive agents are\neven hypothesized to have antiviral properties [23,24]. It is however\nevident that frail individuals, including patients with multiple co\ufffemorbidities, are at increased risk of COVID-19 [5].,\nOne could therefore\nargue that transplantation may in fact, in the longer run, ameliorate\nthat risk. In light of limited and contradictory evidence, and in part\ndriven by stretched and overwhelmed hospital capacity, the Dutch\ntransplant community was an early adopter of the recommendations\nmade by Kumar et al. (Table 1B) [6]. In general, this led to prudence in\nperforming kidney transplantation until the impact of induction and\nmaintenance immunosuppression on COVID-19 is more understood.\nDeceased-donor kidney transplantation is considered case-by-case in a\nshared decision process with the patient, carefully weighing the ur\ufffegency and benefit of transplantation against risks. This approach al\ufffelowed for regional differences among centers while sharing a similar\npolicy. More specifically, kidney and pancreas transplantations for\nwhich T- and/or B-cell depleting induction therapy is deemed necessary\n(ABO and Human Leukocyte Antigen-incompatible and other high-im\ufffemunological risk transplantations) are halted. Even though current\nevidence suggest that children are generally less impacted by COVID\ufffe19, pediatric kidney transplant programs are restricted similarly to\nadult programs. Given the high waiting list mortality and suboptimal or\nabsent alternative treatment options for end-stage disease, liver-, heart\ufffeand lung-transplantation should continue in principle. For liver it is\nagreed that transplantation should continue to be focused on the pa\ufffetients with the highest need, i.e. high-urgent cases, those with Model for\nEnd-stage Liver Disease (MELD) > 20, or with otherwise life-threa\ufffetening disease such as hepatocellular carcinoma approaching borders of\nMilan criteria (Table 1B). As discussed before, with progression of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, ICU capacity across the country is limited. As a\nresult, per March 25, all heart and lung transplant-centers have limed\ntheir capacity for now to urgent cases with low life expectancy if not\ntransplanted (Table 1B). It is expected that the need for urgent lung\ntransplantation may rise in the upcoming weeks for patients with severe\nARDS [25]. As community acquired risk for COVID-19 is high, it is\nagreed that COVID-19 positive patients could return on the active organ\nwaiting list after resolution of clinical symptoms and negative COVID\ufffe19 nasopharyngeal swab or sputum PCR (Table 1B). At this point, there\nare no specific criteria for these patients in the ET region, but mono\ufffeorgan failure with preserved rehabilitation capacity is generally re\ufffecommended.\nRegarding post-transplant care, all elective post-transplant out\ufffepatient care is replaced by telephone and e-consultations when possible.\nIn addition, centers shared local treatment protocols for transplant re\ufffecipients. Protocols were based on RIVM recommendations for therapy\nand included recommendations on triage (admission versus home\nmonitoring), adjustment of immunosuppression and drug-drug inter\ufffeactions [26] and international guidelines [27,28]. COVID registries\nwere started and linked to existing national and international (i.e.,\nEuropean ERACODA) databases [29].\n7.
