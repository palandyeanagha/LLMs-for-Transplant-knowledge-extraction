Finding a strategy to prevent CMV infection is an important issue.\nMethods: We performed a retrospective, single-centre study of 114 lung transplant recipients (LTRs) who\nunderwent lung transplantation from January 2001 to December 2006. In a smaller cohort of 88 CMV\nseropositive (R+) LTRs, three months of valganciclovir prophylaxis (2004-2006) was compared to three months\nof oral ganciclovir (2001-2003) with respect to the incidence of CMV infection/disease, the severity of CMV\ndisease, acute rejection, BOS-free 4 year survival and 4 year survival. In the whole group of 114 LTRs the impact\nof CMV infection on long-term survival (BOS free 4 year survival and 6 year survival) was assessed.\nResults: For the cohort of 88 CMV seropositive LTRs, the incidence of CMV infection/disease at one year was\nlower in the valganciclovir group compared to the ganciclovir group (24% vs. 54%, p = 0.003). There was a\ntendency towards reduced CMV disease, from 33% to 20% and a significant lower incidence of asymptomatic\nCMV infection (22% vs. 4%, p = 0.005). A lower incidence of acute rejection was observed in the valganciclovir\ngroup. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in BOS free 4 year survival and\n4 year survival.\nFor the entire group of 114 LTRs, BOS-free 4 year survival for recipients with CMV disease was (32%, p = 0.005)\nand among those with asymptomatic CMV infection (36%, p = 0.061) as compared with patients without CMV\ninfection (69%). Six year survival was lower among patients with CMV disease, (64%, p = 0.042) and asymptomatic CMV\ninfection (55%, p = 0.018) than patients without CMV infection (84%).\nConclusions: A lower incidence of CMV infection/disease and acute rejections was observed with valganciclovir\n(3 months) when compared to oral ganciclovir (3 months). The long-term impact of CMV infection/disease was\nsignificant for BOS-free survival and survival.\nKeywords: Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, Cytomegalovirus, Ganciclovir, Lung transplantation, Survival rates,\nValganciclovir\n* Correspondence: inger.johansson@infect.gu.se 1\nDepartment of Infectious Diseases, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of\nGothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\u00a9 2013 Johansson et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

        "text": "Background\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most clinically significant\nopportunistic infection that can occur following lung\ntransplantation (LTx). The reported incidence of CMV\ninfection/disease ranges from 38% to 75% in lung transplant\nrecipients (LTRs) in the absence of any prophylaxis [1]. In\naddition, CMV infections can have indirect effects; such as\nallograft rejection, diminished graft and patient survival as\nwell as a predisposition for opportunistic infections\nand malignancies [2,3]. Finding strategies to prevent\nCMV infection/disease is a major challenge following\nlung transplantation. In a previous study of 187 LTRs\nwe reported that oral ganciclovir (GCV) prophylaxis\nfor 3 months delayed the onset and reduced the severity\nof CMV disease when compared to intravenous (IV)\nganciclovir for 4 weeks [4]. Today, IV GCV followed by\nVGCV or VGCV alone are the most common prophylaxis\nstrategies [5]. However, there is no consensus on the\noptimal duration of prophylaxis for LTRs. Valganciclovir is\na prodrug of ganciclovir with greater bioavailability\n(60%) than oral GCV (6%) and oral GCV 1000 mg t.i.d.is\nequivalent to VGCV 450 mg daily [6].\nThe main cause of long-term morbidity and mortality\nin LTRs is bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS)\nthat is present in 49% of recipients 5 years after lung\ntransplantation and at 10 years the rate reaches 75% [7].\nBOS is a chronic allograft dysfunction/chronic rejection\nthat is defined as a progressive airflow obstruction not\nexplained by acute rejection, infection or other confounding\ncomplication [8]. CMV replication in lung allograft is\ndescribed as accelerating the development of BOS [9-13].\nThe aims of this study were to compare 3 months of\nCMV prophylaxis using oral ganciclovir with 3 months\nof valganciclovir with respect to incidence and severity\nof CMV disease and to study the impact of CMV infec\ufffetion/disease on long-term outcomes/survival.\nMethods\nPatient population and study design\nMedical records on patients transplanted between January\n2001 and December 2006 were reviewed. During the study\nperiod 128 lung transplantations were performed. Of these,\n117 transplantations in 114 patients were selected for\ninclusion. Six patients who died within 30 days of\ntransplantation and five re-transplantations were excluded.\nCMV infection, acute cellular rejection (AR) and BOS related\nto the initial lung transplantation were evaluated. Clinical\nepisodes of CMV infection and AR at 12 months were eval\ufffeuated. BOS development was followed annually. Follow-up\non all patients was complete on January 20, 2011.\nThe primary goal of the study was to compare\n3 months of prophylaxis with VGCV to GCV in both the\nshort and long term. To exclude the influence of CMV\nserostatus, only the 88 patients with R + were included in\nthis first cohort. All patients received VGCV or GCV;\nwhich was the standard care for CMV prophylaxis to R + .\nA secondary goal was to assess the impact of CMV\ninfection/disease (regardless of prophylaxis) on the devel\ufffeopment of BOS and survival. In this part of the study,\nboth R + and R- patients were included to get a larger\ngroup (i.e. the second cohort).\nThis research was approved by the local Ethical Committee\nat Gothenburg University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden\nand it follows the applicable standards set by the Declaration\nof Helsinki; reference number \u00d6 393-01.\nData collection\nTo identify CMV episodes; clinical parameters such as\nfever, cough, dyspnoea, hypoxemia and other clinical\nsigns or symptoms mentioned in a clinical record were\nrecorded as well as results from transbronchial biopsy\n(TBB) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to detect CMV\ninfection, (ie.histopathology with CMV inclusion bodies and\nIHC analyses with monoclonal antibodies against CMV).\nAnalyses of CMV replication by PCR were registered if it\nwas performed, (i.e.in our study quantitative analysis of\nCMV DNA in serum). Results from TBB were collected to\nexclude or verify acute rejections.",

The clinical manifestations of CMV \ninfection vary widely. Asymptomatic viremia is the \nmost common symptom, although the infection can oc\ufffecasionally invade various organs such as the lung, or \nthe gastrointestinal tract [2]. Likewise, in the urogenital \ntract, CMV can induce ureteral stenosis by direct inva\ufffesion of ureter tissue [3]. Involvement of grafted kidneys \nby CMV occurs frequently. In previous reports, CMV \ngenomes were documented by in situ hybridization \ntechniques in more than 40% of routine graft biopsies \n[3]. However, significant pathologic changes and al\ufffelograft dysfunction induced by CMV invasion are rarely \nobserved. Indeed, CMV inclusions in tissue have been \nreported in less than 1% of renal biopsies when exam\ufffeined by routine light microscopy. Therefore, an alterna\ufffetive method to detect CMV involvement in graft kidneys \nis required.\nIn a previous report, pathological CMV nephritis was \nsuccessfully diagnosed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) \nand tissue polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [3]. In this \nregard, the present case illustrates manifestation of \nCMV nephritis both by ureteral stenosis and CMV inter\ufffestitial nephritis, diagnosed by IHC stain for CMV. The \npatient was successfully treated with ganciclovir and \nimmunosuppression reduction. We present this case re\ufffeport with a review of the current literature.\nOur patient was a 48-year-old Korean man who suf\ufffefered from end-stage renal failure attributed to hy\ufffepertension who had been on continuous ambulatory \nperitoneal dialysis for 2 years. He had received a living \ndonor renal transplant in January 2010, but the specific \nrecord of the donor was not available because the proce\ufffedure was performed overseas in China. A week after the \ntransplant, when he returned to Korea and visited the \nhospital, he was put on a dual therapy with tacrolimus \nand prednisolone with a serum creatinine of 3.1 mg/dL. \nTacrolimus was titrated to 4 mg twice a day, mycophe\ufffenolate mophetil was continued 750 mg twice a day, and \nprednisolone was added at 25 mg twice a day. Labora\ufffetory investigations revealed the following values: white \nblood cells, 4,840/mm3\n with 94.5% polymorphonuclear \ncells, 1.4% lymphocytes, 4.1% monocytes; hemoglobin \n10 g/dL; hematocrit, 29.7%; platelet count, 151,000/\nmm3\n; creatinine, 3.1 mg/dL; total bilirubin, 0.45 mg/\ndL; AST, 8 U/L; ALT, 9 U/L; albumin, 3.1 g/dL; random \nblood sugar, 133 mg/dL; C-reactive protein, 0.16 mg/dL; \nand urinary microscopic hematuria.\nA Doppler ultrasound of the grafted kidney revealed \nhydronephrosis without visible obstructive lesions and \nfavorable renal perfusion. The patient underwent per\ufffecutaneous nephrostomy and showed contrast leakage \nfrom the ureterovesical anastomosis. Subsequently, an \nanterograde double J (DJ) catheter was inserted with \na ureteral stent via the right hypogastric posterolateral \napproach. A Doppler ultrasound performed after the \ncatheter insertion showed complete regression of hydro\ufffenephrosis of the graft kidney; however, renal function \nwas only partially recovered and the patient\u2019s creatinine \nlevel hovered around 2.2 mg/dL 2 weeks after catheter \ninsertion.\nTo evaluate the cause of the incomplete recovery of \nallograft function, a renal biopsy was performed that \nrevealed calcineurin inhibitor toxicity with tubulopathy. \nGlomerular capillary intracytoplasmic CMV inclusions \nCopyright \u00a9 2012 The Korean Association of Internal Medicine",

        "text": "Patients and methods\nStudy group\nPulmonary complications were reviewed in a computerized\ndatabase of 369 consecutive patients who received either\nallogeneic bone marrow (allo-BMT) or peripheral blood\nSCTs (allo-PBSCTs) between January 1993 and July\n2003 at our institution. Control subjects were selected from\nthe same database. Controls were matched to each\npulmonary case on sex, underlying diagnosis, age, type of\ntransplantation (sib or matched-unrelated donor (MUD)),\nBMT or PBSCT and cytomegalovirus (CMV)-serostatus to\nthe best possible extent. Patients who underwent previous\nallogeneic or autologous SCT were excluded from the\nanalysis.\nTransplantation procedure\nPatients were treated according to clinical protocols\napproved by the local investigation review board after\ninformed consent was obtained. For all patients, the\nconditioning myeloablative regimen consisted of cyclophos\ufffephamide (60mg/kg/day for 2 days) followed by TBI\n(600 cGy/day for 2 days) with partial shielding of the lungs\n(total lung dose 850cGy). The graft was partially T-cell\ufffedepleted23 consisting of 1\u20132  105T cells/kg and was\ninfused after the second TBI fraction (day 0). CD34 dose\nwas only measured for PBSCT and the median dose was\n1.2  106\n/kg. Antithymocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin,\nSangstat, Amstelveen, The Netherlands) was given to\nMUD patients before cyclophosphamide was infused, at a\ntotal dose of 20mg/kg until April 1999 and 8 mg/kg\nthereafter.\nPost transplant immunosuppression consisted of cyclo\ufffesporine, which was discontinued within 3 months after\ntransplantation when no active GVHD was present.\nGVHD was diagnosed according to the Seattle criteria24\nand treated with 1\u20132 mg/kg/day prednisolone and resump\ufffetion of full dose cyclosporine if applicable. Donor\nlymphocyte infusions were administered in case of residual\ndisease or relapse at a dose of 0.01\u20131.0  108T cells/kg\nto eight patients with pulmonary disease and to 20\ncontrols.\nInfection prevention consisted of ciprofloxacin, flucona\ufffezole plus amphotericin B until granulocyte counts exceeded\n500 cells/ml. Cephalothin was given for 10days from day\n\u00fe 3. Furthermore, co-trimoxazole and (val)acyclovir were\ngiven orally from day \u00fe 1 until 12 months post transplant\ufffeation or longer in the case of active GVHD, in a dose of 480\nand 500 mg b.i.d., respectively. CMV-seropositive patient/\ndonor combinations were monitored twice a week during\nthe first 120 days post transplant. Until April 2001, CMV\nmonitoring was based on pp65 antigenemia. Since then\nCMV viral load was determined by a CMV DNA PCR\ntechnique. Pre-emptive treatment with ganciclovir was\nstarted when tests became positive.\nPulmonary complications\nThe established etiologies of the pulmonary disease were\nreviewed by two of the authors (CH and LFV) on the basis\nof clinical, radiological, microbiologic and histological\nfindings. Pneumonia was classified as infectious based on\nthe pathogen reported. According to distinguishing features\ndescribed previously,21 non-infectious complications were\ndefined as BO (absence of fever and pulmonary infiltrates,\npresence of airway obstruction), BOOP (fever, patchy\npulmonary consolidation and typical histology), DAH\n(diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and progressively bloodier\naliquots of lavage return and/or X20% hemosiderin-laden\nmacrophages during bronchoscopy) and IPS (evidence\nof widespread alveolar injury in the absence of lower\nrespiratory tract infection15). Uncomplicated upper airway\ninfections or exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmo\ufffenary disease were excluded from analysis.\nBaseline pulmonary function tests were not obtained in\nall patients. Post transplant pulmonary function tests\nwere performed in patients presenting with pulmonary\ncomplaints. Imaging studies (CT-scan and/or X-ray of the\nchest) as well as cultures and viral screening of sputum and\nblood were performed on all patients presenting with\nfever, cough, dyspnea and/or pulmonary infiltrates post",
