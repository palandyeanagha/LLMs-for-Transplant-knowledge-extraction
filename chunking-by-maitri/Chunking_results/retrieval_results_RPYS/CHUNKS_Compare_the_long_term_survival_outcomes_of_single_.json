Email: wilsonsmithash597@gmail.com.\nBackground: Lung transplantation has long been the accepted therapy for end-stage pulmonary fibrotic \ndisease. Presently, there is an ongoing debate over whether single or bilateral transplantation is the most \nappropriate treatment for end-stage disease, with a paucity of high-quality evidence comparing the two \napproaches head-to-head.\nMethods: This review was performed in accordance with PRISMA recommendations and guidance. \nSearches were performed on PubMed Central, Scopus and Medline from dates of database inception to \nSeptember 2019. For the assessed papers, data was extracted from the reviewed text, tables and figures, by \ntwo independent authors. Estimated survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method for studies where \ntime-to-event data was provided. \nResults: Overall, 4,212 unique records were identified from the literature search. Following initial \nscreening and the addition of reference list findings, 83 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, of which \n17 were included in the final analysis, with a total of 5,601 patients. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis illustrated \nimproved survival in patients receiving bilateral lung transplantation (BLTx) than in those receiving \nunilateral transplantation for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis at all time intervals, with aggregated survival for \nBLTx at 57%, 35.3% and 24% at 5-, 10- and 15-year follow-up, respectively. Survival rates for SLTx were \n50%, 27.8% and 13.9%, respectively. \nConclusions: Whilst a number of studies present conflicting results with respect to short-term \ntransplantation outcomes, BLTx confers improved long-term survival over SLTx, with large-scale registries \nsupporting findings from single- and multi-center studies. Through an aggregation of published survival \ndata, this meta-analysis identified improved survival in patients receiving BLTx versus SLTx at all time \nintervals. \nKeywords: Lung transplantation; fibrotic disease; outcomes\nSubmitted Nov 16, 2019.

        "text": "Circulation Journal Vol.81, May 2017\n666 JESEL L et al.\nIn our study, double LT was predictive of increased \nsurvival. Schaffer et al showed that double LT was associ\ufffeated with better graft survival than single LT in patients \nwith idiopathic fibrosis, whereas in the COPD population, \nno survival difference between single LT and double LT \nrecipients at 5 years could be evidenced.22 An ongoing \ndebate remains between proponents of single LT and \ndouble LT for end-stage pulmonary disease.23\nStudy Limitations\nThere are several limitations that should be considered. \nThis was a retrospective single-center study of patients \nwho had uniform surgical procedures and postoperative \nmanagement. Although the cohort was large, the retro\ufffespective analysis may have underestimated the prevalence \nof AAs. Subclinical episodes of late AA may have been \nmissed even if particular care concerning arrhythmias were \nundertaken during the follow-up period.\nSystolic PAP measured by TTE was predictive of late \nAA after transplantation but right heart catheterization \nparameters were not. The delay between catheterization, \noften done prior to registration of a patient on the LT \nwaiting list, and transplantation can be long. TTE system\ufffeatically done before transplantation may reflect the dete\uffferioration in patient state with the highest PAP recorded \nbefore transplantation.\nConclusions\nEarly postoperative AAs following LT are common and \noften transient, in contrast to the low occurrence of late \nand often organized AAs. Early and late AAs do not affect \nmortality following LT. Double LT compared with single \nLT, analogous to PV isolation, protected against late AF \nbut not AFL, underlying the role of the PVs in the genesis \nof AF. Pretransplant sPAP was an independent predictor \nof late AA after surgery.\nDisclosures\nThe authors do not have any relevant financial disclosures that might \npose a conflict of interest in connection with the submitted article.\nReferences\n1.

All patients but two showed feasible func\ufffetional status at discharge and all patients but one\nwere discharged home in the bridge-ECMO group.\nThese results indicate that bridging with ECMO is\nfeasible for patients awaiting lung transplantation by\nconsidering not only survival but also quality of life\nafter discharge.\nIn the present study, the long-term outcomes of lung\ntransplantation after bridging with ECMO were consid\ufffeered acceptable. KOTRY collects data for each patient\nserially at 3, 6, 9, 12 months after discharge, and then an\ufffenually. However, our analysis includes only 2 years of\nfollow-up data since the inclusion of lung transplant pa\ufffetients in KOTRY was initiated only in 2015. Pulmonary\nfunction, including predicted FEV1 and FVC, showed no\nsignificant differences between the bridge-ECMO group\nand non-bridge-ECMO group at 3 months, 6 months, 9\nmonths, 12 months, or 24 months follow-up.

The early treatment \nof complications is important for the long-term survival of lung transplant recipients. Frequently, HRCT plays \na central role in the investigation of such complications. Early recognition of the signs of complications allows \ntreatment to be initiated earlier, which improves survival. The aim of this pictorial review was to demonstrate the \nCT scan appearance of pulmonary complications such as reperfusion edema, acute rejection, infection, pulmonary \nthromboembolism, chronic rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, post\ufffetransplant lymphoproliferative disorder, bronchial dehiscence and bronchial stenosis.\nKeywords: Tomography, X-ray computed; Lung transplantation; Postoperative complications.\nResumo\nCom o n\u00famero cada vez maior e uma melhor sobrevida dos pacientes submetidos ao transplante pulmonar, os \nradiologistas devem estar cientes das diversas possibilidades de complica\u00e7\u00f5es associadas ao transplante de pulm\u00e3o. \nO tratamento precoce das complica\u00e7\u00f5es \u00e9 importante para a sobrevida a longo prazo dos receptores de transplante \npulmonar. Com frequ\u00eancia, a TCAR desempenha um papel central na investiga\u00e7\u00e3o de tais complica\u00e7\u00f5es. O reconhe\ufffecimento precoce dos sinais de complica\u00e7\u00f5es proporciona um tratamento r\u00e1pido e melhora a sobrevida. O objetivo \ndesta revis\u00e3o pict\u00f3rica foi proporcionar uma vis\u00e3o sobre as complica\u00e7\u00f5es mais prevalentes na TC, tais como edema \nde reperfus\u00e3o, rejei\u00e7\u00e3o aguda, infec\u00e7\u00e3o, tromboembolismo pulmonar, rejei\u00e7\u00e3o cr\u00f4nica, s\u00edndrome da bronquiolite \nobliterante, pneumonia em organiza\u00e7\u00e3o criptog\u00eanica, doen\u00e7a linfoproliferativa p\u00f3s-transplante, deisc\u00eancia br\u00f4n\ufffequica e estenose br\u00f4nquica \nDescritores: Tomografia computadorizada por raios X; Transplante de pulm\u00e3o; Complica\u00e7\u00f5es p\u00f3s-operat\u00f3rias.\n* Study carried out under the auspices of the Postgraduate Program in Respiratory Sciences of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande \ndo Sul \u2013 UFRGS, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul \u2013 Porto Alegre, Brazil and of the Postgraduate Program in Radiological \nSciences of the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro \u2013 UFRJ, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro \u2013 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.",

The baseline characteristics of the pa\ufffetients are shown in Table 1. Among them, 71\n(63.4%) were male and the median age of all patients\nwas 58.0 (interquartile range, IQR 52.5\u201362.0) years.\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (53.6%) was the most\ncommon reason for lung transplantation, followed by\nconnective tissue disease associated interstitial lung\ndisease (17.9%) and bronchiolitis obliterans after\nhematopoietic stem cell transplantation (8.9%). One\npatient received simultaneous heart-lung transplant\ufffeation due to Eisenmenger syndrome. All patients\nwere receiving their first lung transplants. The pre\ufffetransplant oxygenation with partial pressure of\narterial oxygen (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen\n(FiO2) ratio (PaO2/FiO2 ratio) was 224.0 (IQR\n125.0\u2013281.0). Thirty-nine patients (34.8%) received\nMV before lung transplantation and all patients in\nthe bridge-ECMO group received MV simultaneously\nbefore lung transplantation. The median duration of\nbridging with ECMO was 11.0 (IQR 6.0\u201318.0) days\nin the bridge-ECMO group. Veno-venous mode (n =\n24, 89%) was the most common type of ECMO used\nin ECMO-bridge group, followed by veno-venous\ufffearterial in two and veno-arterial in one. All but four\nof cannulation configurations for veno-venous\nECMO was femoro-femoral cannulation.\nThe median age of donors was 41.5 (IQR 32.0\u201349.0)\nyears and the most common cause of brain death was\ntrauma (33.0%). Forty-six (41.1%) donors were current\nsmokers.
