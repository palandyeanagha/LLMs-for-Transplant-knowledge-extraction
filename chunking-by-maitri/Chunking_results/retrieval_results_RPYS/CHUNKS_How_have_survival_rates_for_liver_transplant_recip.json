The decline of\nHCV prevalence, combined with recent resurgence of alcohol\ufffeism, has resulted in alcoholic liver disease (ALD) to become\nthe number one cause for LT in the USA, surpassing HCV.13\nHowever, this trend is not expected to last very long, as\nNASH, with its current trajectory, is expected to replace ALD\nand become the leading indication very soon.\nAlthough NASH patients undergoing LT are older and obese\ncompared to those with other etiologies, studies have dem\ufffeonstrated that the short-term and long-term post-transplant\nsurvival rates are very similar. For example, 1- and 3-year\npost-transplant survival rates for NASH LT recipients were\n84% and 78% compared to 87% and 78% (p=0.67) for other\nindications (HCV, ALD, and cholestatic and autoimmune hep\ufffeatitis). In addition, the 3-year graft survival rate was 76% for\nNASH LT recipients.14 In another study, the 5-year survival of\nLT recipients for NASH was superior to those with HCV\n(77.81% vs. 72.15%).12 More recently, in a retrospective\nstudy of 26,121 LT recipients with HCC from 2002-2016,\nNASH patients were older (mean age of 62.9 years) com\ufffepared to those with HCV (59.2 years), HBV (57.2 years) and\nALD (60.6 years), obese (body mass index of >30, NASH\n60.5% vs. HCV 32.9%, HBV 14.4% and ALD 40%) and\nmore likely to be diabetic (NASH 60.3% vs. HCV 22.5%,\nHBV 19.3% and ALD 32.7%). The 1-year post-transplant sur\ufffevival rate was similar across all cohorts (p>0.5) but long-term\nmortality and graft loss were highest in HCV and lowest in\nHBV.15\nAlthough HCV has remained as the most common cause of\nHCC in LT candidates, NASH was the most rapidly growing\ncause, with 11.8-fold increase from 2002 to 2016. Figures 2\nand 3 demonstrate the temporal trends of annual waitlist\nadditions and LT rates in the USA from 2008-2018 for the\ntop 5 etiologies of CLD based on the most recent UNOS\ndata.

They were followed for a median of 9 years. Of \nthe total, 18% experienced severe alcoholic relapse at a median \nof 25 months following liver transplantation and among them, \n41/128 (32%) were diagnosed with recurrent alcoholic cirrhosis at \na median of 5.1 years after liver transplantation.54 A review of \nAmerican transplant data between 1995 and 2007 had similar \nfindings where 16% of patients transplanted for alcoholic liver \ndisease relapsed to drinking.55 A meta-analysis of 50 studies iden\ufffetified 3 significant risk factors for relapse: poor social support, so\ufffebriety for less than 6 months before liver transplantation, and a \nfamily history of alcoholism.56 Psychological or psychiatric comor\ufffebidities are associated with an increased risk of relapse.57 A meta\ufffeanalysis of risk for relapse to substance abuse after liver or other \nsolid organ found that the relapse to any alcohol use after liver \ntransplantation was over twice as common as relapse with heavy \nalcohol use (almost 6 vs. less than 3 cases per 100 persons per \nyear).56\nA correlation between impaired long-term survival and alcohol \nrecidivism has been observed, but mostly due to increased inci\ufffedence of cardiovascular events and malignancy rather than to tox\ufffeic effects of alcohol on the liver graft.47 In this setting, duration of \npre-transplant abstinence does not correlate with post-transplant \nsurvival.58 Smoking has been associated to be an important risk \nfactor for development of malignancy.59\nSome studies have demonstrated no direct deleterious effects of \nalcohol drinking on post-transplant outcomes, including therapeutic \ncompliance, graft function, and graft survival60, while others have \nreported negative impacts of heavy drinking on outcomes.46 These \nconflicting data underline the need for better distinction of the dif\ufffeferent types of alcohol drinking after transplantation, ranging from \noccasional to moderate or severe, when alcohol habits could corre\ufffespond to use, abuse, or dependence.48\nConsensus regarding risk factors for alcohol recidivism is lack\ufffeing. Which subset of patients with AH merit liver transplant and \nwill have least risk of recidivism is still unanswered. The previously \nproposed sobriety rule has been questioned and challenged. \nMoreover, highly selected patients were transplanted in the pub\ufffelished studies which comprised of only 1.4%-2.4% of the liver do\ufffenor pool.32,34\nFor selection of recipient with minimal risk of recidivism and op\ufffetimal use of liver grafts various protocols have been suggested. \nThe potential candidates for transplant must be assessed by a \nmultidisciplinary team. One of the recently published protocols, \nthe New York-Presbyterian Hospital Center for Liver Disease and \nTransplantation Protocol, consisted of set of medical and psycho\ufffesocial requirements.61 The need for psychosocial support should \nnot be underestimated. Patient should have no prior formal sub\ufffestance abuse treatment, no current or past psychiatric diagnoses, \nno comorbid substance abuse, excluding tobacco along with sta\ufffeble housing and family support.\nThe most important factor is identification of the right patients \nwho are best suited for such an aggressive intervention and, in \nfact, a small number of patients fall into this group.62 As in study \nby Mathurin, et al, patients with first episode of AH and those \ndemonstrating willingness to abstain from alcohol and adherence \nto medical regimen can be considered for transplantation.32 This",

Although most transplant programmes still require \na 6month period of abstinence as a mandatory criterion to \nconsider a patient suitable for LT, the role of the pre-transplant \nlength of abstinence as predictor of alcohol relapse after LT has \nnever been demonstrated. This period is becoming an instrument \nto assess patients who could recover their liver function after a \nprolonged alcohol abstinence and therefore could avoid unnec\ufffeessary LT. Conversely, a multidisciplinary assessment, involving \nseveral stakeholders such as a transplant hepatologist, transplant \nsurgeon, psychologist, psychiatrist and addiction specialist is \nbecoming mandatory to properly evaluate the presence of risk \nfactors for alcohol relapse after LT.45 76 77\nThe rates of alcohol relapse ranged from 11.5% to 49%, \nalthough this was rarely a consideration when looking for \nreasons for graft failure in ALD patients.78 Relapse directly \nleading to graft dysfunction ranged from 0% to 17%, whereas \nrelapse directly causing mortality ranged from 0% to 5%. About \n10% of patients relapse into heavy drinking usually within the \nfirst year after LT.79\nAlthough there is evidence that a shorter prelisting abstinence \nperiod corresponds to a shorter period before post-transplant \nrelapse, the ideal period of abstinence pre-transplant is still \ndebatable.80\nMoreover, regular testing for detecting any alcohol use during \nthe evaluation process or while the patients are on the waiting \nlist is mandatory. Lastly, the role of donor/recipient gender \nmismatch should be explored in LT for ALD, as data reported \nworse outcomes when grafts from female donors are used in \nmale recipients.81\nLT for sAH\nWith regards to early LT for sAH not responding to medical \ntherapy, there is increasing evidence that if LT is performed \nin selected patients it represents an effective treatment. Post\ufffetransplant outcomes are good67 82 83 with survival rates that are \nsignificantly higher when compared with patients with sAH \nnot responding to medical therapy and not transplanted82 and \nsimilar to those of ALD cirrhotic LT patients.83 Despite the good \nresults reported, some ethical and social issues persist regarding \nthe role of early LT for patients with sAH. These mainly rely \non the potential reduction of organ donations because of the \npublic perception that a graft is offered to patients who were \nactively drinking just before admission to the waiting list, with \nan increased risk of post-transplant alcohol relapse.

        "text": "between 2017\u20132018, the age adjusted prevalence of obesity in adults (BMI \ufffd 30) was 42.4%,\nand 6.9% of men and 11.5% of women were morbidly obese (BMI \ufffd 40) [11].\nWhile the proportion of liver transplants for hepatitis C has been declining, the proportion\nof liver transplants for liver disease and HCC related to ALD has increased by 130% in both\nmen (from 14.5% to 33.1%) and women (from 9.2% to 21.1%) between 2010 and 2019. ALD\nhas become the leading indication for liver transplants in men and the second major indica\ufffetion for liver transplants in women in 2019. This trend is associated with the rising alcohol use\nin the U.S. population [12, 13]. Although men are traditionally heavier drinkers than women,\nalcohol consumption is rising in women as well. The National Epidemiologic Survey on Alco\ufffehol and Related Conditions reported increases in alcohol use especially among women in addi\ufffetion to older adults and racial/ethnic minorities [14, 15]. The increase in liver transplants for\nALD has also been attributed to broader acceptance of alcoholic liver disease for liver trans\ufffeplants and the relaxation of the mandatory six-month abstinence period prior to transplanta\ufffetion by many transplant centers across the country [16]. Although our study included\ntransplant recipients with HCC or cirrhosis (without HCC) under the same underlying etiol\ufffeogy (Tables 1\u20133), a similar trend in liver transplants for HCV, ALD and NAFLD was found in\nboth recipients without HCC and recipients with HCC (S4 Table).\nHCC is a common indication for liver transplantation, although it has declined from 33%\nto 29% of the transplants in men, and from 20% to 15% among women who received liver\ntransplants between 2010 and 2019. Hepatitis C was the most common cause of HCC among\nliver transplant recipients, but it has decreased from 68.3% to 46.0% in men and from 66.4% to\n36.7% in women between 2010 and 2019. The proportion of liver transplants for HCC caused\nby ALD has increased by 130% in men (from 8.2% to 18.5%) between 2010 and 2019, although\nit remained a less common cause of HCC in women. Proportion of liver transplants for HCC\ncaused by NAFLD showed the greatest increase from 4.4% to 15.4% in men and from 6.9% to\n29.7% in women between 2010 and 2019. Our findings are consistent with a recent study that\nin the first quarter of 2019, NASH has surpassed HCV (including HCV+ALD) among women\nwith HCC on the liver transplant waitlist, but HCV remained the major etiology among men\nwith HCC on the liver transplant waitlist in 2019 [5]. Hepatitis B was the second most com\ufffemon cause of HCC in men and women in 2010, but has since dropped to fourth in men and\nthird in women.\nBetween 2010 and 2019, there was a decrease in the proportions of liver transplants for\nacute hepatic necrosis (unrelated to hepatitis B or C), cryptogenic cirrhosis and in the category\nof unspecified diagnosis. Although the reason for the decrease in acute hepatic necrosis is\nunclear, the latter two decreasing trends likely reflect better diagnosis and coding entries into\nthe UNOS database. There were also increases in liver transplants for graft failure and benign\nhepatic tumors that were not been previously reported. In the past 10 years, there were no sig\ufffenificant changes in the proportions of liver transplants for cholestatic liver disease, autoim\ufffemune liver disease, metabolic liver disease, unspecified causes of HCC, other malignant\ntumors, Budd-Chiari, and in the several diseases we placed in the miscellaneous category.\nFrom 2010 to 2019, about 75% of liver transplants in adults and 87% of liver transplants for\nHCC each year were performed for complications of largely preventable or treatable causes\n(hepatitis C and hepatitis B, alcohol associated liver disease, and NAFLD). A public health\nresponse to improve awareness, prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment is much needed to",

Although some groups have recently \nreported acceptable 1year survival post-LT (including patients \nwith ACLF-3),87 this topic is highly controversial. In addition \nto the need for strict selection criteria to minimise the risk of \nalcohol relapse after LT, the question of objective limits beyond \nwhich the patient must be considered too sick for LT remains \nunanswered. Future studies are needed to better define LT selec\ufffetion criteria for those patients without any effective medical \ntherapeutic option.\nLT in patients with HCC associated with ALD\nHCC is one of the main causes of cancer-related death and its \nmortality is increasing worldwide. In Europe, alcohol abuse \naccounts for about half of liver cancer cases and it will become \nthe leading cause of HCC in the future. LT for patients with \nHCC represents the best possible treatment in case of tumour \nrecurrence or progression despite locoregional or surgical treat\ufffements. Long-term results after LT for HCC associated with ALD \nare good. However, cardiovascular disease and other de novo \nmalignancies can significantly hamper patients\u2019 survival and \nshould be carefully considered by the transplant team.88\nAnimal models\nOver the last five decades many animal models for the study of \nthe pathogenesis of ALD have been developed and are useful \nto study the different stages of ALD (see figure 6). Recently, \none of the major advances in the field of ALD research was the \nintroduction of binge alcohol intake into chronically ethanol-fed \nmice, causing neutrophilia, hepatic neutrophil infiltration and \nsignificant liver injury.89 This is useful for the study of the early \nstage of ASH. Briefly, mice were fed chronically the Lieber\u2010\nDeCarli ethanol diet for 10 days, followed by gavaging a single \ndose of ethanol.89 This model was orignially called the NIAAA \nmodel89 and later was also called the Gao-binge model.90 91 Due \nto easy, short and reproducible feeding protocol, this model has \nbeen now widely used to study early stages of ASH and mild \nAH.92 Binge ethanol intake was later also introduced into long\ufffeterm (up to 12 weeks) chronic ethanol-fed mice,93 causing more \nsevere steatohepatitis than the 10day chronic-plus-binge ethanol \nfeeding model. This long-term chronic-plus-binge ethanol \nfeeding induced mild fibrosis whereas the 10day chronic-plus\ufffebinge ethanol model only caused fibrogenic responses without \nsignificant fibrosis. Moreover, high-fat diet feeding plus binge \nethanol intake caused severe steatohepatitis with significant \nneutrophil infiltration and mild fibrosis94\u201397 whereas high-fat diet \nfeeding only caused steatosis in mice. This high-fat diet feeding \nplus binge ethanol intake is a very useful model to study the \nsynergistic effect of obesity and binge drinking on liver injury. \nFinally, weekly binges were also recently introduced into mice \nthat are chronically fed ethanol, high-fat and high cholesterol \ndiets via intragastric infusion.98 This complex model shifted \nmacrophge infiltration into neutrophil infiltration, causing more \nsevere liver inflammation (neutrophil infiltration), injury and",
