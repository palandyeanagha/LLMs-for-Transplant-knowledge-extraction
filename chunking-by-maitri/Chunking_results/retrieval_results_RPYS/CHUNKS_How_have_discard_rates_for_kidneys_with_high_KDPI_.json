There was, however, a significant decrease over time in the\ncrude mortality rate associated with AKI (annual percentage\nchange, -3.4%; 95% CI, -4.7 to -2.12; P < 0.001). There was\nno change for those without AKI over the study period. The\npresence of AKI remained associated with higher mortality\nafter adjustment for age, sex, comorbidity, surgical/medical\nadmission, primary diagnosis, severity of illness (APACHE II\nscore), mechanical ventilation and hospital site (OR, 1.39;\n95% CI, 1.3 to 1.5; P < 0.001). Over the study period, there\nwas a trend for decreasing ORs for death associated with AKI.\nAdditional clinical outcomes\nThose patients with AKI had a longer median (interquartile\nrange) stay in both the ICU and the hospital than those without\nAKI (Table 5). Specifically, AKI increased both the duration of\nthe ICU stay (4.4 (2.1\u20139.5) days for AKI versus 2.6 (1.7 to 4.9)\ndays for no AKI, P < 0.0001) and of the hospital stay (14.2\n(6.5 to 28.9) days for AKI versus 11.7 (7.0 to 21.9) days for\nno AKI, P < 0.0001). The total duration of stay was also signif\ufffeicantly longer in survivors to hospital discharge stratified by\nAKI than in nonsurvivors (19.8 (10.8 to 37.2) days versus 11.9\n(7.2 to 21.9) days, P < 0.0001). There were no significant\nchanges in ICU or hospital lengths of stay over the study\nperiod.\nThe hospital discharge location was significantly different for\npatients with AKI compared with those patients with no AKI\n(Table 5). Fewer patients with AKI were discharged home than\npatients without AKI (74.8% versus 84.8%, P < 0.001);\ninstead, AKI patients were more likely to have been transferred\nto another acute care hospital (16.6% versus 9.6%, P <\n0.001) or a rehabilitation facility (8.6% versus 5.5%, P <\n0.001). There were no significant changes in hospital dis\ufffecharge location over the study period.\nDiscussion\nWe conducted a 10-year observational study of > 90,000 ICU\nadmissions to 20 ICUs in Australia, using a high-quality clinical\ndatabase, to evaluate trends in the incidence and mortality\nassociated with AKI. We found that approximately 5.2% of\ncritically ill patients are diagnosed with AKI at the time of ICU\nadmission and that the incidence of AKI has increased\nTable 2\nIncidence rates (95% confidence intervals) of acute kidney injury stratified by two-year intervals, and admission characteristics from \nthe Australia New Zealand Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database 1996\u20132005\nCovariate Cumulative Incidence rates per two-year period\nCases\n(n = 4,754)\nIncidence \n(5.2 (5.1\u20135.4))\n1996/1997\n(n = 849)\n1998/1999\n(n = 684)\n2000/2001 \n(n = 926)\n2002/2003\n(n = 1,158)\n2004/2005\n(n = 1,137)\nAdmission category\nElective 544 1.7 (1.5\u20131.8) 1.4 (1.1\u20131.7) 1.0 (0.7\u20131.3) 1.5 (1.3\u20131.8) 2.4 (2.1\u20132.8) 1.8 (1.4\u20132.1)\nNonelective 4,209 7.2 (7.0\u20137.4) 7.0 (6.5\u20137.4) 6.8 (6.3\u20137.3) 7.2 (6.7\u20137.7) 7.9 (7.5\u20138.4) 7.0 (6.6\u20137.5)\nAdmission type\nSurgical 957 2.1 (2.0\u20132.2) 2.5 (2.2\u20132.8) 2.0 (1.7\u20132.3) 1.7 (1.4\u20132.0) 2.6 (2.3\u20132.9) 1.9 (1.7\u20132.2)\nMedical 3,752 8.3 (8.0\u20138.5) 7.5 (7.0\u20138.1) 7.6 (7.0\u20138.2) 8.5 (7.9\u20139.1) 9.3 (8.7\u20139.9) 8.1 (7.6\u20138.6)\nSurgical subcategory\nCardiovascular 376 1.6 (1.4\u20131.8) 1.9 (1.5\u20132.2) 1.8 (1.4\u20132.3) 1.3 (1.0\u20131.6) 1.7 (1.4\u20132.1) 1.3 (1.0\u20131.6)\nTrauma 72 1.7 (1.3\u20132.1) 2.9 (1.6\u20134.2) 1.6 (0.7\u20132.4) 1.4 (0.7\u20132.1) 1.5 (0.7\u20132.2) 1.7 (0.8\u20132.6)\nDiagnostic category\nSepsis/septic shock 1,109 19.5 (18.5\u201320.5) 23.0 (20.0\u201326.0) 19.1 (16.0\u201322.2) 20.6 (18.1\u201323.1) 22.9 (20.6\u201325.2) 15.4 (13.8\u201317.0)\nCardiac 658 11.2 (10.4\u201312.0) 9.6 (8.0\u201311.3) 12.5 (10.3\u201314.6) 10.9 (9.0\u201312.7) 11.8 (10.0\u201313.6) 11.6 (9.9\u201313.3)",

        "text": "Acute kidney injury\nOverall, AKI incidence ranged from 28% (95%CI 25\u201331%)\nto 75% (95%CI 72\u201377%) when applying the 30 different\napproaches to AKI (Fig. 2, Additional file 1: E-Table 2). In\ufffecidence was highest when using the age-adjusted CKD\ufffeEPI formula to estimate the baseline sCr and sliding 6-h\nUO windows. Incidences were lowest when using only\navailable baseline sCr and no estimation formula, com\ufffebined with 24-h cumulative UO values or without using\nUO at all. Different sCr options caused a variation of up\nto 15%. Different UO approaches caused a variation of up\nto 35%. More granular methods, like AKI burden simi\ufffelarly, varied (Additional file 1: E-Table 3).\nNinety-day mortality\nEleven patients (1%) were lost to follow-up due to mi\ufffegration. At the 90-day follow-up, 263 patients (26%) had\ndied (Table 1). Most applied criteria for AKI were\nassociated with 90-day mortality (Additional file 1: E\ufffeTable 6). Of all different criteria, using no baseline\ncreatinine estimation combined with 24-h cumulative\nUO data seemed to have the strongest univariable\nassociation with 90-day mortality for AKI burden and\nusing no UO data at all for persistent AKI (Add\ufffeitional file 1: E-Table 7).\nSensitivity analyses\nVariation of incidences was similar when excluding patients\nwith CKD (Additional file 1: E-Fig. 3). Variation in AKI in\ufffecidence was 26% when including only patients in whom\nbaseline sCr was known (Additional file 1: E-Fig. 4).\nDiscussion\nIn this post hoc study using data from a prospective ob\ufffeservational study on AKI in acutely admitted critically ill\npatients, we showed that AKI incidence varied depend\ufffeing on the method used to apply KDIGO criteria. Our\nresults may partly explain the high variability in AKI in\ufffecidence in the literature and provide an opportunity to\nincrease the comparability for future observational stud\ufffeies and RCTs focusing on AKI.\nPrevious studies have assessed the differences between\nprevious versions of AKI definitions such as the RIFLE\ncriteria and demonstrated that these differences led to\nvarying associations between AKI and outcomes [31,\n32]. The initiative to define AKI uniformly was based on\nthe need to be able to compare research results. Still,\nbased on our hypothesis, up to 80 different methods can\nbe used to assess AKI using the current KDIGO defin\ufffeition. Methods varied based on baseline sCr handling,\nUO data handling, how AKI is defined (any AKI, severe\nAKI, etc.), and whether both UO and sCr should be ful\ufffefilled or either [33], as it is recommended they are to be\nused independently for diagnosis and staging. In conclu\ufffesion, without one uniform approach to KDIGO criteria,\ncomparison of study outcomes or systematic reviews of\nprevious AKI studies is complicated.\nThe impact on the incidence of AKI using different\nmethods to enter baseline sCr has been widely recognized\n[20, 34]. The absence of a sCr baseline and differences in\nmethods handling the missing data should be standard\ufffeized, as back estimations seem insufficient [12], and in a\nsensitivity analysis, we showed that variation of AKI inci\ufffedence decreased if baseline sCr was known and thus no\nestimation was needed. Overall, it seems from our results\nthat using only available baseline sCr and no estimation\nresults for sCr leads to the strongest association with mor\ufffetality. One possible explanation for this finding could be\nthat the patients with a measured sCr baseline have a rea\ufffeson to be hospitalized or even had renal failure. However,\nwe deem this explanation unlikely, as the observed sCr\nvalues are within normal ranges.\nTable 1 Baseline characteristics of included patients\nN = 1010\nAge, years (SD) 61 (15)\nGender, male, n (%) 630 (62%)\nAdmission type, %\nMedical 64%\nAcute surgery 32%\nOther* 4%\nBMI, kg/m2 (SD) 26 (5)\nDiabetes mellitus, n (%) 190 (19%)\nLiver cirrhosis, n (%) 43 (4%)\nAPACHE IV, mean (SD) 70 (31)\nChronic kidney disease, n (%) 88 (9%)\nObserved baseline serum creatinine, mmol/L (IQR) 76 (58, 102)\nAt study inclusion",

NAFLD is frequently accom\ufffepanied by multiple traditional risk factors for CKD progression including obesity and diabetes, but evidence \nsupporting the independent role of NAFLD on CKD progression is still lacking.\nWe thus investigated the association of NAFLD and its severity with the longitudinal decline in kidney func\ufffetion in a cohort of CKD patients, adjusting for traditional risk factors for CKD.\nResults\nThe mean (standard deviation, SD) age of study patients was 60.8 (11.3) years, and the prevalence of NAFLD at \nbaseline was 40.9% (Table\u00a01). Compared to patients without NAFLD, those with NAFLD were more likely to be \nyoung, male, smokers, and had a higher level of body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol, and other metabolic \nrisk factors. The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at baseline was 59.1ml/min/1.73m2\n (26.2% \npatients had proteinuria \u22652+on urinalysis). While eGFR at baseline was higher in patients with NAFLD com\ufffepared to those without NAFLD at baseline (61.8 vs. 57.3ml/min/1.73m2\n, p<0.001), patients with NAFLD had \nhigher proportion of proteinuria than those without NAFLD (30.2 vs. 23.5%, p=0.004).\nThe average duration of follow-up was 6.5 years (maximum 13.6 years; average number of visits per participant \n6.3). During follow-up, the age- and sex-adjusted decline in eGFR was greater in patients with NAFLD (\u22120.79% \nper year, 95% CI \u22121.31%, \u22120.27%) compared to those without it (0.30%, 95% CI \u22120.14%, 0.76%; p=0.002).\nAfter adjustment for age, sex, and year of visit, the average difference in annual percent change of eGFR \nbetween patients with NAFLD and those without NAFLD was \u22121.09% (\u22121.89%, \u22120.27%; p=0.009; Table\u00a02). \nThe results did not materially change after adjusting for confounders or potential metabolic mediators. The mul\ufffetivariable adjusted average difference in annual percent changes in eGFR comparing patients with low NAFLD \nfibrosis score (NFS) (<\u22121.455) or intermediate to high NFS (\u2265\u22121.455) and those without NAFLD were 0.01% \n(\u22120.74%, 0.99%) and \u22122.12% (\u22122.93%, \u22121.31%), respectively (Table\u00a02).\nCharacteristics Overall\nNon-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Status\nNo Yes p value\nNumber of patients 1,525 902 623\nAge, years 60.8 (11.3) 61.4 (11.5) 59.9 (10.9) 0.009\nSex <0.001\n\u00a0Male 1,065 (69.8) 567 (62.9) 498 (79.9)\n\u00a0Female 460 (30.2) 335 (37.1) 125 (20.1)\nBMI, kg/m2 24.8 (3.0) 23.7 (2.7) 26.4 (2.7) <0.001\nSmoking <0.001\n\u00a0Never 742 (48.7) 485 (53.8) 257 (41.3)\n\u00a0Past 216 (14.2) 111 (12.3) 105 (16.9)\n\u00a0Current 255 (16.7) 122 (13.5) 133 (21.4)\n\u00a0Missing 312 (20.5) 184 (20.4) 128 (20.6)\nModerate alcohol consumption 868 (56.9) 475 (52.7) 393 (63.1) <0.001\nFasting glucose, mg/dl 104.1 (30.1) 99.6 (24.8) 112.1 (34.9) <0.001\nHemoglobin A1c, % 5.9 (1.1) 5.7 (1.0) 6.2 (1.2) <0.001\nUse of antidiabetic medications 255 (16.7) 127 (14.1) 128 (20.6) 0.001\nDiabetes 359 (23.5) 155 (17.2) 204 (32.7) <0.001\nSystolic blood pressure, mmHg 126.5 (18.8) 125.4 (19.1) 128.1 (18.3) 0.006\nUse of antihypertensive medications 731 (48.0) 391 (43.4) 341 (54.7) <0.001\nHypertension 913 (59.9) 502 (55.7) 411 (66.0) <0.001\nTriglycerides, mg/dl 125 (94\u2013179) 110 (83\u2013149) 151 (114\u2013213) <0.001\nTotal cholesterol, mg/dl 201.8 (39.2) 199.1 (38.9) 205.8 (39.2) 0.001\nLDL cholesterol, mg/dl 131.1 (35.3) 128.8 (35.0) 134.4 (35.6) 0.002\nHDL cholesterol, mg/dl 50.1 (13.8) 52.8 (15.0) 46.2 (10.6) <0.001\nLipid lowering medications 85 (5.6) 46 (5.1) 39 (6.3) 0.33\nHyperlipidemia 630 (41.3) 285 (31.6) 345 (55.4) <0.001\nALT, U/L 26.2 (16.9) 21.2 (11.8) 33.5 (20.2) <0.001\nAST, U/L 26.0 (13.8) 23.7 (8.5) 29.2 (18.6) <0.001\nGGT, U/L 37.3 (39.3) 29.9 (30.6) 48.1 (47.2) <0.001\nEstimated GFR, ml/min/1.73m2 59.1 (17.3) 57.3 (16.8) 61.8 (17.6) <0.001\nProtein \u22652+on urinalysis 400 (26.2) 212 (23.5) 188 (30.2) 0.004",

However, cardio\ufffevascular disease (CVD) is frequently associated with CKD, and\nindividuals with CKD are likely to die of CVD before they develop\nterminal renal failure (31, 32). The American Heart Association\n(33) has published a scientific statement to emphasize the impor\ufffetance of recognizing CKD as one of the majorrisk factorsfor CVD\nand recommendsthat measurement of urinary albumin excretion\n(UAE) and estimation of GFR be included in the evaluation of\npatients with or at high risk for CVD.\nIn low-income countries, facilities for dialysis are extremely\nscarce or altogether nonexistent, and patients with CKD are fac\ufffeing an ominous fate. In countries where the living conditions\nare somewhat improving, and the income is increasing, a wor\uffferisome increase in CVD and diabetes is witnessed (34, 35). In\nlow-income countries, social and public health pilot experiences\nhave shown that early detection of CKD is feasible at affordable\ncosts (36, 37). The next step is to provide aid to these countries\nand to also prove that inexpensive treatment for the prevention\nof CKD progression is possible.\nThe progressive nature of kidney disease\nCertain renal diseases, including rapidly progressive glomerulone\ufffephritis, although rare, have a very rapid course that quickly leads\nto irreversible ESRD. More common nephropathies do progress\nless rapidly, but still evolve to ESRD at different rates (Figure 1).\nWhen serum creatinine is elevated beyond a certain level, progres\ufffesion is inevitable (S1\u2013S3, 38).\nThe rate of progression of renal disease in hereditary kidney\ndiseases such as autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease is\nhighly variable, due to genetic heterogeneity (S4\u2013S6, 39). Individu\ufffeals with mutations in polycystic kidney disease 1 (PKD1) experience a\nmore severe disease course, ultimately progressing to ESRD by the\naverage age of 54,while individualswith mutationsin PKD2 experi\ufffeence loss ofrenal function approximately 20 yearslater(40\u201342, S7).\nWhen renal function falls below 75% of normalthe decline israpid,\nrequiring RRT in a matter of 5\u201310 years (S8, 43).\nAfter 10\u201315 years of stable renal function or even hyperfiltra\ufffetion,small amounts of albumin may appearin the urine of 20\u201340%\nof patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. UAE rate in the range\nof 20\u2013200 mg/min or 30\u2013300 mg/d (microalbuminuria) (44\u201346,\nS9) is an early marker of nephropathy. If left untreated, 80\u2013100%\nof microalbuminuric patients with type 1 and 20\u201340% of patients\nwith type 2 diabetes progress to overt nephropathy, a syndrome\nof macroalbuminuria (UAE >200 mg/min or >300 mg/d), declin\ufffeing GFR, and increased cardiovascular morbidity (44, 45, 47, S9).\nIn the case of macroalbuminuria, GFR relentlessly declines at an\naverage of 10\u201312 ml/min/yr (48) (Figure 2). At least two-thirds of\npatients with overt nephropathy will die from CVD before they\nprogress to ESRD, a mortality rate 5- to 8-fold higher than in the\naverage population (49). While on dialysis, 21% of these patients\nwill die within 1 year (50).\nNondiabetic glomerulopathies include IgA nephropathy. Pro\ufffegression to ESRD occurs in 30% of patients after a follow-up of\n25 years (51). A further 20% will have impaired renal function and\nwill progress eventually. Membranous nephropathy has a variable\ncourse (52, 53, S10, S11) with an insidious onset and increasing\nproteinuria up to nephrotic ranges. In the long term,spontaneous\nremission occurs in up to 30% of individuals, while the remaining\ntwo-thirds experience either equally persistent proteinuria of vari\ufffeable degrees \u2014 although usually of declining severity, and with\nnormal or impaired butstable renal function \u2014 or progressive dis\ufffeease eventually leading to ESRD.

AKI diagnosis was\nbased on change between two creatinine values within a\n48-hour period for AKIN classification and within a 1-\nweek window for RIFLE criteria. Severity of AKI in AKIN\nis staged over the course of 7 days by fold-change in\ncreatinine from baseline.\nThe latest classification was proposed by the Kidney\nDisease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Acute\nKidney Injury Work Group, was based on the previous\ntwo classifications, and had the aim of unifying the defin\ufffeition of AKI [15]. According to this definition, AKI was di\ufffeagnosed as an increase in SCr by at least 26.4 \u03bcmol/L\nwithin 48 hours or an increase in SCr to 1.5 times base\ufffeline, which is known or presumed to have occurred within\n7 days before, or a urine volume of less than 0.5 mL/kg per\nhour for 6 hours. For KDIGO criteria, the 26.4 \u03bcmol/L\nincrease needs to be within 48 hours but a 1.5-fold increase\ncan occur within 7 days to diagnose AKI; and the 1-week\nor 48-hour timeframe is for diagnosis of AKI, not for\nstaging. A patient can be staged over the entire episode\nof AKI. Increase in SCr to 3 times baseline, or SCr of\nmore than 4.0 mg/dL (354 \u03bcmol/L), or starting RRT were\nall classified as stage 3. KDIGO removes the 0.5 mg/dL\nincrease for creatinine more than 4 mg/dL to diagnose\nstage 3. Besides, KDIGO explicitly states that a rolling\nbaseline can be used over 48-hour and 7-day periods for\ndiagnosis of AKI, but it is unclear how this is handled in\nRIFLE or AKIN. The definition and difference among the\nthree criteria are shown in Additional file 1.\nMany studies have compared RIFLE with AKIN in crit\ufffeically ill patients, but only a few have compared KDIGO\nwith these criteria in critically ill patients with AKI. The\npurposes of this study were to determine the incidence\nof AKI in critically ill patients according to the RIFLE,\nAKIN, and KDIGO criteria and to compare their predict\ufffeive ability.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy cohort\nThis study used a database from a prospective, multicen\ufffeter, observational study which investigated the epidemi\ufffeology of AKI in critically ill patients at 30 ICUs of 28\ntertiary hospitals in Beijing, China, from 1 March to 31\nAugust 2012.

This limitation for an accurate\nmanagement of aHUS patients arises whereas highly efficient targeted therapies are now avail\ufffeable [8]. While TTP diagnosis was rendered easier by the identification of a severe ADAMTS13\ndeficiency [16], no reliable biological markers allow a rapid and accurate diagnosis of aHUS. A\ndetectable ADAMTS13 activity is a prerequisite for this diagnosis [1,17]. However, within\npatients with features of aHUS (i.e., TMA patients with renal failure, a detectable ADAMTS13\nactivity and no associated STEC), distinct diseases with specific pathophysiological mecha\ufffenisms, therapeutic modalities and prognosis may be further individualized. Here, our results\nprovide evidence that according to clinical presentation, prognosis of renal function in patients\nwith a diagnosis of aHUS and treated with PE before the era of the complement blocker eculi\ufffezumab is variable, ranging from complete renal function recovery following TMA episode to\nESRD. Therefore, ADAMTS13 activity alone (i.e., a detectable activity) is not sufficient to iden\ufffetify patients at risk of CKD who would benefit from complement blockers.\nWe report that severe renal impairment, high blood pressure and a mildly decreased platelet\ncount in aHUS at diagnosis are associated with significant 1-year renal impairment.
