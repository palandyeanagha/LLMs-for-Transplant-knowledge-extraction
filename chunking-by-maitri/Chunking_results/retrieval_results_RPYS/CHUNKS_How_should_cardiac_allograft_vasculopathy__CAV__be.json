In general, routine surveillance for CAV is advocated with coronary angiography accompanied by intravascu\ufffelar ultrasound (IVUS) if necessary. However, these modalities have limitations with respect to low spatial resolution, and \nsuffi cient qualitative/quantitative assessment of coronary intima has not been accomplished. Recently, optical coherence \ntomography (OCT) has emerged as a novel intracoronary imaging technique using an optical analogue of ultrasound \nwith a spatial resolution of 10-20 \u00b5m, which is 10 times greater than IVUS. We here experienced a 49-year-old male \nwho received a HTx 3 years ago, and OCT was executed during low molecular weight dextran injection. OCT demon\ufffestrated distinct double intimal layers probably consisting of a donor-transmitted atherosclerotic layer and an inner intimal \nproliferation due to CAV, which was indistinguishable by IVUS and virtual histological analyses. We believe that OCT \nimaging is not only a new loadstar during treatment of CAV but also a new generation modality for screening for early \nCAV in HTx recipients. (Int Heart J 2014; 55: 178-180)\nKey words: Intima, Everolimus, Intravascular ultrasound\nA lthough major improvements have been made in sur\ufffegical techniques and treatments for acute rejection, \naccelerated cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) \nstill limits the remote survival in heart transplantation (HTx) \nrecipients.1) CAV is a pathologically multifaceted disorder that \naffects epicardial coronary arteries with different types of le\ufffesions including intimal fi bromuscular hyperplasia, atheroscle\uffferosis, and infl ammation.2) In distinction from general coronary \natherosclerosis, which is marked by focal and eccentric fi bro\ufffefatty atheroma, CAV involves the entire coronary vasculature \ndiffusely with marked intimal proliferation and concentric vas\ufffecular thickening and fi brosis.3) Typically, HTx recipients do not \nexperience angina because of perioperative denervation, but \neventually present with left ventricular dysfunction as a conse\ufffequence of progressed myocardial ischemia.4) Therefore, an In\ufffeternational Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation \n(ISHLT) working group recommended regular surveys with \ncoronary angiography regardless of the recipient\u2019s symptoms \nfor early detection of CAV, accompanied by subsequent IVUS \nwhen CAV is suspected.5)\nRecently, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has \nemerged as a new generation catheter-based modality that ac\ufffequires images at a spatial resolution of 10-20 \u00b5m, enabling vis\ufffeualization of blood vessel wall microstructure in vivo at an un\ufffeprecedented level of detail.6) However, little is known about \nadaptation of OCT for analyses of CAV. Hence, we experi\ufffeenced a chance to conduct OCT along with coronary angiogra\ufffephy and IVUS in a heart transplantation (HTx) recipient, and \ndiscuss the utility of OCT.\nCase Report\nIn 2010, a 46-year-old male with dilated cardiomyopathy \nreceived a HTx from a male adult donor after undergoing 2 \nyears of left ventricular assist device support.

Of 7 false-negative segments \nfor detecting CAV by MDCT, 6 were identified on 16-detec\ufffetor CT, presumably because of insufficient spatial resolution \nfor distal lesions or because of motion artifacts. Improvement \nof the temporal and spatial resolution of 64-detector CT, as \ncompared with 16-detector CT, may contribute to improved \nsensitivity.\nA high heart rate reduces the image quality of MDCT, so \nmost studies using 16-detector CT have recommended that \nthe heart rate be reduced by administration of \u03b2-blockers be\ufffefore the scan is performed. Cardiac re-innervation is highly \nvariable and reported as only 10\u201330% in heart transplant \nrecipients, so the efficacy of \u03b2-blockers is also considered to \nbe variable and limited.5,7 Thus, \u03b2-blockers were not admin\ufffeistered to the patients in the present study because of the \ninsufficient benefit by this medication over the estimated risk.\nThe alternative use of dual-source CT scanners, which con\ufffesist of 2 independent X-ray tubes with their corresponding \ndetectors mounted onto a rotating gantry with an angular \noffset of 90 degrees, improve the constant temporal resolu\ufffetion to 83ms and allow high-quality coronary artery imaging \nwithout \u03b2-blocker administration in a wide range of heart \nrates.25 Dual-source CT actually allows very frequent, diag\ufffenostic-image-quality coronary angiograms (92.1% of the \ncoronary segments) in heart transplant recipients with high \nheart rates and no \u03b2-blocker administration, and may have \nbeen highly useful also for our cohort.26\nOf 3 false-positive segments that were all graded as wall \nthickening by MDCT, 2 were detected by 64-detector CT, \nalthough IVUS was not performed and the details of the \ndisagreement are unknown in these cases. One segment was \ndetected by 16-detector CT and confirmed by IVUS.\nMDCT may detect mural lesions induced by CAV that \nare difficult to diagnose by CCAG alone. Some studies also \nreport that 16- and 64-detector CT may be more sensitive \nthan CCAG for detection of thickened coronary segments in \nheart transplant recipients.5,8,9 Moreover, the diameter mea\ufffesurements of coronary vessel show excellent correlation \nbetween MDCT and quantitative CAG for heart transplant \nrecipients, and MDCT may be helpful for revealing late lumen \nloss, which is a typical feature of CAV.9,27 Thus, MDCT may \nbe a promising noninvasive procedure for detecting CAV.\nMDCT has some limitations, including the requirement for \nnephrotoxic contrast medium and radiation exposure.9 A sub\ufffestantial number of heart transplant recipients have impaired \nrenal function, mainly because of post-transplant administra\ufffetion of calcineurin-inhibitors, and are therefore at risk for \ncontrast-induced nephropathy.9 In addition, because of the \nsmaller helical pitch and higher tube power, effective doses \nwith 64-detector CT using retrospective ECG-gated helical \ntechnique (9.5\u201321.4mSv) are higher than with 16-detector \nCT (3.1\u20139.4mSv), as well as that required for recent routine \ndiagnostic CCAG (\u22482\u201310mSv).28,29 The use of ECG-con\ufffetrolled tube current modulation reduces the effective dose \nby approximately 40%, as well as the lifetime attributable \ncancer risk, compared with the standard retrospective ECG\ufffegated helical technique, especially for women and younger \npatients, maintains diagnostic image quality, and is recom\ufffemended to use whenever possible.30\u201332 The recently introduced \nuse of prospective ECG-gated axial technique allows further \ndose reduction by 77\u201383% to a level of lower than that with \nCCAG.28,33\u201335 The latter 2 scan techniques, however, have \nlimited indications for patients with high heart rate and/or",

Regular follow\ufffeup contributes to detection of complications like coronary\nallograft vasculopathy and chronic transplant rejection\nwhich can result in significant graft coronary artery disease\nor myocardial fibrosis with loss of contractility. Coronary\nallograft vasculopathy is usually clinically silent and\ntherefore presents a diagnostic challenge; because of con\ufffetinued denervation in the majority of heart transplants,\nany occurrence of myocardial ischemia in those grafts is\nasymptomatic with angina being rarely. They might man\ufffeifest sequelae of coronary artery disease, including signs of\ncongestive heart failure or loss of transplant function, or\nthey may experience arrhythmias or sudden death.\nCurrent diagnostic standards for the diagnosis of cardiac\nvasculopathy are invasive coronary angiography and for\nacute or chronic transplant rejection endomyocardial\nbiopsy [1]. Endomyocardial biopsy is still the main tech\ufffenique for rejection surveillance. However biopsying is\ninvasive and may be associated with complications [2].\nThus, there is a need for non-invasive methods. Non-inva\ufffesive assessment of coronary vessels, left ventricular func\ufffetion and myocardial fibrosis has recently been examined\nby multi-slice spiral computed tomography and magnetic\nresonance imaging [3,4].\nOur present pilot study was performed to analyze the rela\ufffetionship between the results from magnetic resonance\nimaging and those from endomyocardial biopsy respec\ufffetively the end-points cardiac transplant rejection and its\ndegree of severity. Further we conducted this study to\ninvestigate the relationship between the results from cor\ufffeonary angiography and those from the multi-slice spiral\ncomputed tomography respectively the end-points car\ufffediac transplant vasculopathy and its degree of severity.\nThe results should clarify if the non-invasive approach is\nreliable and could be superior in long time survivors after\nheart transplantation.\nMethods\nRoutine follow-up for heart transplant patients\nThe routine follow-up consisted of clinical examination,\nblood testing, electrocardiogram and echocardiography\nand chest X-ray every three months.\nBlood testing\nRoutine blood testing consisted of red and white blood\ncount with differential haemogram and cardiac enzymes\n(creatinin-kinase with its isoenzyme CK-MB and Tropo\ufffenine I). The parameters for liver (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT,\nLDH albumin and bilirubine), renal function (creatinine,\nurea) and coagulation (platelet count, INR and partial\nthromboplastin time) were part of the routine. Further\nserum analyses were lipids (triglycerides, HDL and LDL\ncholesterol), electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride\nand magnesium) and CRP. To rule out any infectious dis\ufffeeases virologic analyses with PCR were performed to\ndetect cytomegaly virus, hepatitis A-E virus, herpes sim\ufffeplex, varicella zoster virus and human herpes virus 4.\nFinally the serum levels of the immunosuppressive drugs\n(cyclosporine A or mycophenolate) were analysed.\nZytological analyses\nThis summarizes analyses of sputum, pharyngeal smear\nand urine to assess any bacterial, viral or fungal infections.\nElectrocardiogram\nA 12-lead electrocardiogram was part of the basic follow\ufffeup.\nEchocardiography\nTo assess the patient's heart valves, ejection fraction and to\nrule out any vegetations and pericardial effusion patients\nwere examined lying on their left side on the examination\ntable.

MRCA has 2 main advantages: \nneither radiation exposure nor administration of nephrotoxic \ncontrast medium is required.12 The whole-heart, 3-dimension\ufffeal (D), steady-state free precession (SSFP) technique, dif\ufffeferent from earlier methods of MRCA, is currently widely \nused, and has been well-validated for assessing patients with \nCAD.13 The technique provides superior signal-to-noise and \ncontrast-to-noise ratios, decreases dependence on the inflow \nof unsaturated protons, and facilitates multiplanar reconstruc\ufffetions. However, the feasibility of this whole-heart technique \nfor detecting CAV has not been reported.\nOur aim in this study was to assess the feasibility of MDCT \nand whole-heart MRCA for detecting and evaluating CAV \nin heart transplant recipients, using CCAG as the reference \nmethod.\nMethods\nPatients\nBetween December 2003 and July 2007, 22 consecutive heart \ntransplant recipients (17 men, 5 women; 13\u201357 years old, \nmean, 34.9\u00b115.7 years at the examination) underwent MDCT \nand/or whole-heart MRCA, in addition to CCAG, as screen\ufffeing examinations for detecting CAV. The underlying diseases \nwere dilated cardiomyopathy in 14 patients, restrictive cardio\ufffemyopathy in 5, and dilated phase of hypertrophic cardiomyop\ufffeathy in 3; 13 patients underwent MDCT; 16 had whole-heart \nMRCA, and the other 7 underwent both MDCT and whole\ufffeheart MRCA. Of those patients who underwent MDCT, 3 \nunderwent 16-detector computed tomography (CT) and 10 \nunderwent 64-detector CT. All gave written informed consent.\nCCAG\nInvasive CCAG was performed by experienced cardiologists \nusing standard techniques, and the angiograms were visually \ninterpreted by the same cardiologists, who were unaware of \nthe findings of MDCT or whole-heart MRCA.\nThe coronary tree was divided into 9 segments for analy\ufffesis: left main stem; proximal left anterior descending (LAD); \nmiddle LAD; distal LAD; proximal left circumflex (LCX); \ndistal LCX; proximal right coronary artery (RCA); middle \nRCA; and distal RCA. Findings in the first diagonal branch \nwere evaluated with those of the middle LAD, and in the \nsecond diagonal branch, with those of the distal LAD. The \nobtuse marginal branches were assessed together with the \ndistal LCX. Only vessels >1.5mm in diameter were evalu\ufffeated in the present study.\nEach coronary segment was visually assessed and graded \non a 3-step severity scale: no disease, wall thickening, and \nstenosis. Wall thickening was defined as an irregularity in \nthe arterial wall or luminal narrowing without significant \nstenosis (\u226450% in diameter), and stenosis was defined as \nsignificant arterial stenosis (>50% in diameter) or occlusion. \nThe presence of CAV was established if the segment was \nclassified as either wall thickening or stenosis.\nMDCT\nOf the 13 patients who underwent CT coronary angiogra\ufffephy with retrospective ECG-gated helical scan, 3 were on a \n16-detector scanner (Lightspeed Ultra 16; GE Healthcare, \nMilwaukee, WI, USA) and 10 were on a 64-detector scanner \n(LightSpeed VCT; GE Healthcare). Scan parameters for \n16-detector CT were as follows: individual detector width, \n0.625mm; gantry rotation time, 500ms; tube voltage, 120kV; \ntube current, 400mA. For 64-detector CT, the respective \nparameters were: 0.625mm, 350ms, 120 kV, and 700mA.",

Thus we compared multi-slice\ncomputed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging with invasive methods like coronary\nangiography and left endomyocardial biopsy.\nMethods: 10 asymptomatic long-term survivors after heart transplantation (8 male, 2 female,\nmean age 52.1 \u00b1 12 years, 73 \u00b1 11 months after transplantation) were included. In a blinded fashion,\ncoronary angiography and multi-slice computed tomography and ventricular endomyocardial\nbiopsy and magnetic resonance imaging were compared against each other.\nResults: Cardiac allograft vasculopathy and atherosclerosis were correctly detected by multi-slice\ncomputed tomography and coronary angiography with positive correlation (r = 1). Late contrast\nenchancement found by magnetic resonance imaging correlated positively (r = 0.92, r2 = 0.85, p <\n0.05) with the histological diagnosis of transplant rejection revealed by myocardial biopsy. None of\nthe examined endomyocardial specimen revealed cardiac allograft rejection greater than\nGrade 1 R.\nConclusion: A combined non-invasive approach using multi-slice computed tomography and\nmagnetic resonance imaging may help to assess cardiac allograft vasculopathy and cardiac allograft\nrejection after heart transplantation before applying more invasive methods.\nPublished: 16 August 2009\nJournal of Cardiothoracic Surgery 2009, 4:43 doi:10.1186/1749-8090-4-43\nReceived: 29 March 2009\nAccepted: 16 August 2009\nThis article is available from: http://www.cardiothoracicsurgery.org/content/4/1/43\n\u00a9 2009 Usta et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.",

Dipchand\nLabatt Family Heart Centre, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada\nCorrespondence to: Anne I. Dipchand, MD. Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario L1V 1L1, Canada. \nEmail: anne.dipchand@sickkids.ca.\nPediatric heart transplantation is standard of care for children with end-stage heart failure. The diverse \nage range, diagnoses, and practice variations continue to challenge the development of evidence-based \npractices and new technologies. Outcomes in the most recent era are excellent, especially with the more \nwidespread use of ventricular assist devices (VADs). Waitlist mortality remains high and knowledge of \nrisk factors for death while waiting and following transplantation contributes to decision-making around \ntransplant candidacy and timing of listing. The biggest gap impacting both waitlist and overall survival \nremains mechanical support options for infants and patients with single ventricle physiology. Though acute \nrejection has decreased progressively, both diagnosis and management of antibody-mediated rejection has \nbecome increasingly challenging and complex, as has the ability to understand the implication of anti-HLA \nantibodies detected both pre- and post-transplantation\u2014including when and how to intervene. Trends in \nimmunosuppression protocols include more use of induction therapy and steroid avoidance or withdrawal \nprotocols. Common long-term morbidities include renal insufficiency, which can be mitigated with \nsurveillance and renal-sparing strategies, and infections. Functional outcomes are excellent, but significant \npsychosocial challenges exist in relation to neurodevelopment, non-adherence, and transition from child\ufffecentered to adult-centered care. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) remains a barrier to long-term \nsurvival, though it is more apparent that objective evidence of an impact on the allograft is important with \nregards to impact on outcomes. Retransplantation is rare in pediatric heart transplant recipients. Pediatric \nheart transplantation continues to evolve in order to address the challenges of the diverse group of patients \nthat reach end-stage heart failure during childhood. \nKeywords: Heart transplant; outcomes; sensitization; waitlist; mechanical support\nSubmitted Oct 04, 2017.
