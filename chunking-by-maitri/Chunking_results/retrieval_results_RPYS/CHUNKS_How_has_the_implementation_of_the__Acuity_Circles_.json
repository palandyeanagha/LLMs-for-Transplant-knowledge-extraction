This may be exacerbated by other\nfactors such as warm-ischemia time [13].\nCold-ischemia time along with the supply of organs, patient\ndemand and the matching regime appear to be the key parameters\nto the liver allocation system. Therefore, reducing CIT through\nmore efficient organ allocation [13,14] or improving the\npreservation method should improve outcomes and the effective\nuse of a limited healthcare resource. Understanding the relation\ufffeship between CIT, PNF and patient and graft survival can help\nbetter define the limits and needs of our allocation system and\nbetter match more organs to patients.\nA key factor determining the consequences of CIT is the\npreservation method. Preservation methods have evolved and\nimproved considerably over time and may be expected to continue\nto do so. The better preservation becomes the closer the system\nresembles banking systems like the one used for blood products.\nSuch a system would allow better buffering of imbalances between\nsupply and demand. Historically, the first preservation solutions\nwere isotonic electrolytic solutions for skin grafts such as Ringer\u2019s\nsolutions in the 1890s [46]. Refrigeration came into use in the\n1940\u201350s to preserve skin used as temporary dressing for burns\n(www.transweb.org/reference/timeline). Since the first successful\nsolid organ transplants (Kidney 1953 Boston, JE Murray, Brigham\nand Women\u2019s Hospital, Boston, MA) and the first successful liver\ntransplant (Liver 1963, Denver, T Starzl, Univ. Col.) [21], there\nhas been a growing need to be able to preserve organs for longer\nperiods of time. The most commonly used preservation media\nhave been Euro Collins [47], University of Wisconsin Solution\n[48] and Celsior solution [49]. At first cut, in our study groups\nusing Celsior solution appeared to perform better with regard to\nPNF than the other groups. However, the Celsior patients also had\nshorter CITs than either the UW or EC groups. Although there\nappeared to be the beginnings of a trend indicating improved\noutcomes with Celsior, we had insufficient studies using Celsior\nsolution, due to the strict constraints of our inclusion and exclusion\ncriteria, to determine if this solution performed better when\nFigure 4.

In contrast to the \nischemia under such clinical conditions, cold ischemia \nis exclusively related to the transplant setting.\nThe specific period of cold ischemia (used to \nreduce metabolic activities of the graft) begins when a \ndonor graft is harvested using a cold perfusion \nsolution and ends after the tissue reaches the \nphysiological temperature during the implantation \nprocedures. The cold ischemia process is followed by \na period of warm ischemia, which ends with the \ncompletion of surgical anastomosis after blood-flow \nrestoration [30, 31]. Inevitably, this step is responsible \nfor the major part of the LT injury and the \ndevelopment of graft failure that is coupled with \nconsiderable morbidity and mortality in patients [32]\n(Figure 1).\nThe cellular and molecular mechanisms of I/R \ninjury are poorly understood; however, the injury is \nrecognized to affect hepatocytes and biliary epithelial \ncells. The I/R injury caused by cold ischemia and \nwarm ischemia can produce common and specific \neffects on various subsets of cells. For example, \nsinusoidal endothelial cells are more susceptible to the \neffects of cold preservation than are hepatic \nparenchymal cells. In the remaining viable endothelial \ncells, the expression of adhesion molecules is affected, \nand this accentuates the I/R injury (Figure 2).\nFigure 1.

        "text": "In the presented study the NMP was commenced following a\nmedian cold storage time reaching 8 h. Whilst this approach may\nsimplify adoption of the NMP technology without compromising\noutcomes in transplantable livers25, recovery of organs from\ndonors with multiple high-risk features might be further facili\ufffetated by limiting cold ischaemia through commencing the per\ufffefusion immediately after procurement in the donor hospital14.\nInevitably there will always be livers that are not suitable for\ntransplantation, demonstrated by 30% of offers with macroscopic\ncirrhosis, biopsy-proven fibrosis or an incidental finding of donor\ncancer. A similar proportion of the livers, however, did not meet\nany of our high-risk criteria and were therefore considered \u201ctoo\ngood\u201d for inclusion. It is reasonable to assume that NMP\nassessment would have provided the reassurance needed to justify\ntransplantation in this group as well.\nImprovements in transplant logistics is one of the major\nadvantages of NMP14,25,26, and the study allowed for the machine\nperfusion duration to be between 4 h (time needed for the via\ufffebility assessment) and 24 h (maximum recommended time by the\nperfusion device manufacturer). Once the liver met the viability\ncriteria we aspired to commence the transplantation as soon as\npossible; however, the perfusion was often extended to allow for a\nday-time procedure, or to facilitate transplant logistics in the unit.\nFrom our experience, 4\u20136 h perfusion seems to be sufficient for\nadequate assessment and replenishment of the organ\u2019s energy\nresources. Due to recirculation of metabolites accumulated in the\norgans during cold ischaemia, the high-risk organs probably do\nnot benefit from prolonged perfusion. The impact of NMP\nduration on livers initially exposed to prolonged cold ischaemia is\nan area of our ongoing research interest.\nTransplant surgeons in many countries are expanding the\ndonor pool with the use of organs donated after circulatory\ndeath27. In the context of liver transplantation, the longevity of\nthese organs might be compromised by development of non\ufffeanastomotic biliary strictures8. The incidence of clinically man\ufffeifest non-anastomotic biliary strictures in the DCD grafts cohort\nwas 30% (3 out of 10 grafts), higher than the study matched\ncontrols group, but similar to other reported high-risk DCD\nseries28. In concordance with the European prospective nor\ufffemothermic preservation trial, our results suggested that MRCP\nfindings are likely to over-estimate the incidence of biliary com\ufffeplications14. The per-protocol investigation at the 6-month time\npoint would identify over 80% of the clinically relevant biliary\nstrictures and asymptomatic irregularities with varying clinical\nsignificance28. The presented findings are accurate, as the images\nwere correlated with clinical reviews and liver function tests\nthrough the median follow up of 542 (range: 390\u2013784) days.\nNevertheless, it is clear that end-ischaemic NMP does not prevent\nthe development of non-anastomotic biliary strictures in high\uffferisk DCD organs, and our outcomes suggest that extending the\ndonor warm times beyond the currently widely accepted limit of\n30 min is not advisable. This finding was not anticipated at the\ntime of trial design or during the conduct of the trial and only\nbecame evident during the long-term follow up of these grafts\nbeyond the primary end point of 90 days. Further work is needed\nto identify new limits (e.g. donor characteristics, warm ischaemia\ntime and cold ischaemia time) and to define perfusion biomarkers\nthat predict this complication and avoid futile transplantation.\nRecently published research suggests that the composition of bile\nproduced during perfusion (pH, bicarbonate and glucose\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n0\n5\n10\nArterial lactate measurement (mmol/L)\n15\nPerfusion time (minutes)\n20\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n0 500 1000 1500\n0 500 1000 1500\n0 500 1000 1500 0 500 1000 1500 0 500 1000 1500 0 500 1000 1500\n123456\n7 8 9 10 11 12",

There is concern regarding the effects of abrupt reperfu\ufffesion on the organ. The concept of controlled oxygenated\nrewarming was introduced by Minor et al.,\n29 initially as an\nadjunct to hypothermic perfusion. Banan et al.30 then com\ufffebined gradual rewarming with NMP and reported improved\nINR, bile production, cholangiocyte function and decreased\nendothelial damage compared to immediate NMP after 4 h of\ncold storage. However, these results were inferior to the group\nthat underwent NMP immediately without 4 h of cold storage.30\nSome investigators have looked at optimizing the outcomes\nfrom NMP through the addition of other adjuncts to the circuit.\nIn 2012, Chung et al.31 described the addition of a kidney to\nthe liver NMP circuit. Although the authors saw no improve\ufffement in inflammatory cytokine expression, subsequent experi\ufffements did find improvements in glucose, pH and renal\nparameters such as urea and creatinine. Liver function did\nnot appear to be compromised. Another study by the same\ngroup demonstrated that placing the kidney in the circuit\nbefore the liver, was more physiologic and produced better\nresults compared to the liver-first circuit.32\u201334 Although en\nbloc liver-kidney transplants are not mainstream, this finding\nrepresents another area of exploration in patients undergoing\ncombined liver-kidney transplantation.\nOther adjuncts include addition of pharmacologic mole\ufffecules to mitigate ischemic injury. Goldaracena et al.35\ndemonstrated improvement in liver function with the addition\nof anti-inflammatory strategies, including alprostadil and\nn-acetylcysteine. It is worth noting, however, that other studies\nhave shown decreased inflammation with NMP, even in the\nabsence of added anti-inflammatory compounds.36 The\nconcept of the addition of therapeutic compounds to the NMP\nperfusion circuit to improve outcomes following transplanta\ufffetion remains one of the areas of greatest potential growth in\nNMP technology and is, therefore, worth pursuing.\nSmall animal ex-vivo liver perfusion studies\nThere have been a limited number of rodent NMP studies due\nto their small size and lack of appropriate NMP technology, until\nrecently. The smaller size and decreased complexity, however,\noffers the ability to study different aspects of ex-vivo NMP per\ufffefusion at reduced cost. One of the earliest successful ex-vivo\nperfusions of a mouse liver was performed by Baba et al.37 in\n1988. In a proof-of-concept study, the group demonstrated\nstable ATP levels and minimal ischemia after 80 m of ex-vivo\nperfusion with oxygenated fluosol-DA.37 In 2008, Talboom and\ncolleagues38 were able to successfully resuscitate Lewis rat\nlivers using NMP after 45 m of warm ischemia and 2 h of\nsimple cold storage. The animals that received these perfused\nlivers had comparable survival to those with fresh livers, and\ndid better than those who received livers stored by SCS only.38\nThe same group, in 2012, used a mouse DCD model to study\nmachine perfusion/preservation at 208\nC, 308\nC and 378\nC. These\nlivers were subsequently transplanted, allowing for evaluation\nof long-term outcomes. Results showed that compared to SCS,\nwhere none of the recipients survived past 12 h, 100% of the\nrecipients from perfused livers (at all three temperatures)\nsurvived.39\nPerk et al.,\n40 using a DCD rat NMP model, developed a met\ufffeabolic index of ischemic injury that could be used to evaluate\nex-vivo perfused ischemic livers, helping to predict the function\nand, as such, suitability for transplantation.

More\nspecifically, the time from asystole to cold flush is critical in this per\ufffespective and significant differences in the incidence of NAS have been\nfound depending of the length of this time period. However, ischemia\ncan also occur between withdrawal of life support and circulatory ar\uffferest, since during this time period a drop in blood pressure and oxygen\nsaturation is frequently observed. For example, the duration of a sys\ufffetolic blood pressure below 50 mm Hg from withdrawal of life support\nuntil cold flush has been identified as a significant predictor of poor\noutcome after DCD liver transplantation [20].\nApart from CIT and DWIT, all liver grafts endure a (second) period\nof warm ischemia during graft implantation, when the liver is taken\nfrom ice, placed in the recipient's abdomen and vascular anastomoses\nare constructed. In most centers portal reperfusion is performed prior to\nhepatic artery reperfusion, because this allows early decompression of\nthe splanchnic venous outflow. However, portal blood has a relatively\nlow oxygen saturation and does not contribute much to the biliary\nperfusion. Therefore, portal reperfusion of a donor may result in addi\ufffetional warm ischemia of the biliary tree. Since the bile ducts are mainly\ndependent on oxygen-rich blood supply from the hepatic artery, artery\nfirst or simultaneous reperfusion has been suggested to be superior to\nsequential reperfusion in preventing additional ischemic injury of the\nbile ducts. However, evidence for this is not unequivocal and con\ufffeflicting data have been reported from different clinical studies [21\u201326].\nIn one, relatively small, prospective randomized study comparing se\ufffequential and simultaneous reperfusion, a significantly lower incidence\nof NAS was observed in livers after simultaneous reperfusion [22].\nHowever, in another large multicenter analysis comparing different\ngraft reperfusion techniques no differences in graft survival or biliary\ncomplications were found between the groups [23]. To this end it\nshould be noted that although the main blood supply to the bile ducts\ncomes from the hepatic artery, portal blood flow contributes to the\nperibiliary vascularization as well via intrahepatic anastomoses be\ufffetween the portal and arterial circulation. This explains why bleeding\nfrom the cut surface of the extrahepatic donor bile duct is frequently\nseen after portal reperfusion of a liver graft. Interestingly, NAS has also\nbeen reported in case reports of portal vein thrombosis or stenosis after\ntransplantation, suggesting that inadequate portal perfusion should be\nconsidered a risk factor for the development of NAS as well [27,28].\n2.1.2. Secondary ischemia\nApart from primary ischemia that affects the bile ducts during the\nvarious stages of the transplant procedure, secondary ischemia may\noccur after transplantation due to injury of the PVP. When endothelial\ncells of the small arteries, capillaries and veins of the PVP are damaged\ndue to the ischemia and/or immune-mediated processes coagulation\nactivation and intravascular formation of microthrombi occurs, re\ufffesulting in secondary ischemia of the biliary epithelium and other bile\nduct wall components. Therefore, inadequate flush out and preserva\ufffetion of the PVP of donor livers has been proposed as a possible me\ufffechanism underlying the development of NAS after liver transplantation.\nIn this regard, the use of preservation fluids with a high viscosity has\nbeen associated with a higher risk of NAS, compared to low-viscosity\npreservation fluids. It is thought that a high-viscosity preservation fluid,\nsuch as the University of Wisconsin solution, do not reach and flush out\nthe PVP as well as low-viscosity fluids, such as histidine-tryptophan\ufffeketoglutarate (HTK) and Marshall solution [29,30]. Although some\nstudies have suggested that low-viscosity preservation fluids are indeed\nassociated with a lower incidence of NAS after transplantation, these",

Survival at 12, 24, and \n36 months for the EVLP cohort was 84%, 79%, and 74%, \nrespectively, compared to 85%, 79%, and 73%, for the \nsame time periods in the standard protocol cohort. Cox \nproportional hazard analysis demonstrated a hazard ratio of \n1.00 (95% CI: 0.79\u20131.27; P=0.981; Figure 1).\nLeave-one-out analysis of Kaplan-Meier data was \nconducted to examine the sensitivity of Kaplan-Meier and \nhazard ratio results to individual patient data from each \nstudy.
