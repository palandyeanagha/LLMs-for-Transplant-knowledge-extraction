Waiting until a Fontan develops \nPLE or plastic bronchitis is, in our opinion, somewhat \nlate to refer for consideration of cardiac transplantation. \nFurthermore, a PVR of 4 Wood units is considered \na relative rather than an absolute contraindication to \ntransplant, especially with the cadre of medications now \navailable to treat pulmonary vascular disease. It also depends \nmore on the reactivity of the pulmonary vascular bed with \nprovocative testing than the absolute number. \nWaiting list and mechanical circulatory support \nas a bridge to cardiac transplantation\nAttrition for wait-listed heart transplant patients is expected. \nClinicians must be vigilant regarding the patient\u2019s clinical \nstatus and the development of end organ dysfunction. \nWhen end organ dysfunction ensues, it may necessitate \nthe use of mechanical circulatory support as a bridge \nto transplant. In the 2016 ISHLT guidelines of listing \ncriteria for heart transplantation, mechanical circulatory \nsupport is recommended when patients develop potentially \nreversible or treatable comorbidities such as renal failure and \npharmacologically reversible pulmonary hypertension (39). \nA broad selection of devices is available, including \nextracorporeal membrane oxygenation, pulsatile devices, \ncontinuous flow devices, and the total artificial heart \n(Figure 2). High volume centers, including many pediatric \ncenters, are able to offer these devices across the age \nspectrum. In 2011, Davies et al. evaluated risk factors for \nwait-list mortality utilizing the UNOS database over a \n15-year time period from 1995 to 2009 (42). The use of \nmechanical circulatory support was a risk factor for increased \nwait-list mortality in ACHD patients (regardless of device \ntype) but not patients without congenital heart disease. \nIn fact, in non-ACHD patients, the use of a ventricular \nassist device actually lowered wait-list mortality.

Subsequently, the number of pa\ufffetients on the waiting list as well as the time of HTx candid\ufffeacy has increased in Switzerland (fig. 2) and elsewhere [1,\n5]. In addition, mortality on the waiting list has increased\nin some countries [1, 5] while remaining stable in Switzer\ufffeland (fig. 2).\nIn an attempt to decrease mortality on the waiting list, the\ndonor heart allocation algorithm was adapted in the United\nNetwork of Organ Sharing in the United States. This adapt\ufffeation favours allocation of donor hearts for patients wait\ufffeing in urgent status and increased the respective percentage\nfrom 74% to 92% [9]. While decreasing mortality on the\nwaiting list by 17% [10], this strategy prioritises allocation\nof donor hearts to patients waiting on the urgent list; setting\npatients on the normal waiting list at a disadvantage.\nThe Swiss transplantation law mandates equality of organ\nattribution for all patients on the waiting list. Therefore, the\ndelay between time of listing and HTx is in Switzerland,\nat large, a function of the time on the waiting list provided\nthat other criteria of the allocation algorithm such as blood\ngroup and donor/recipient body weight match.

The ISHLT \nregistry is an international registry where federal mandate in \nthe United States requires all data from the United Network \nof Organ Sharing (UNOS) to be shared with the database, \nbut is otherwise voluntary. It currently contains data on \nover 14,000 transplants in children worldwide, which is \nfelt to represent three quarters of the worldwide transplant \nactivity (2). The PHTS is a voluntary, research-based and \nevent-driven multicenter registry that was established in \n1993 in order to capture data relative to outcomes, and \ncurrently includes 7,716 patients listed for transplantation, \nof which 5,586 patients underwent transplantation, between \nJanuary 1, 1993, and December 31, 2016 from 53 centers in \nNorth America, the United Kingdom and Brazil.\nRecipient demographics\nThe number of pediatric heart transplants reported to the \nISHLT registry has increased over time with 442 in 2004, \n586 in 2014 (Figure 1) and more recently 684 in 2015 (2). \nThe age distribution of the recipients has remained stable \nsince the mid-1990s (Figure 2).

Most centers in Europe average <10 \ntransplants per year while centers averaging >10 per year \nmake up 60% of transplants in North America; this is \ncontrast to an average of 1 to 4 transplants performed by \nthe majority of centers elsewhere in the world.

In general, there was no difference in the \nlength of hospital stay according to each complication, except \nmediastinal bleeding (p=0.034). The presence of renal failure \nrequiring renal replacement therapy (p=0.003), ECMO in\ufffesertion (p=0.038), and arrhythmia (p=0.011) resulted in the \nprolongation of ICU stay, while the other complications did \nnot affect the duration of ICU stay.\nDISCUSSION\nThis study represents the experience with early post\ufffeoperative complications of adult heart transplantation accumu\ufffelated at the Asan Medical Center over a 13-year period, dur\ufffeing which significant advancement in organ procurement and \noperative techniques, refinement in perioperative care, and \nchanges in immunosuppressive protocols were achieved. As \npreviously reported, the long-term results of our institution \nwere comparable to those reported by the ISHLT [5]. Despite \nthis achievement in long-term outcomes, few studies have \nevaluated the early postoperative outcomes and complications \nafter heart transplantation from the surgical perspective. This\nencouraged us to systematically collect and review our expe\uffferience, focusing on the less-studied aspects.\nThis study demonstrated that the early mortality was ex\ufffecellent [8], compared with that reported by other centers \n[9-11]. Due to the low incidence of early mortality, we were \nnot able to identify the statistically significant risk factors for \nmortality. However, notably, two patients had preoperative \nhepatic dysfunction, which is compatible with previous stud\ufffeies suggesting an association between poor clinical outcomes \nand preoperative hepatic dysfunction [12]. The leading cause \nof early mortality was septic shock, followed by intracerebral \nhemorrhage, owing to anticoagulation during ECMO support. \nIn contrast to the 30-day mortality reported by ISHLT, in \nwhich primary graft failure is the leading cause of death [5], \ngraft failure was not listed as a cause of death in our study.\nOther postoperative complications, including mediastinal \nbleeding, renal failure, early graft failure, CVA, and sternal \nwound infection reported in our study, could be compared fa\ufffevorably with those reported in other studies across the world \n[13-18]. These complications could be adequately managed \nwith either a surgical or medical modality. The presence of \ncomplications did not make a difference in the length of ICU \nand hospital stay in a majority of cases; patients with renal \nfailure, arrhythmia, and ECMO insertion had a longer ICU \nstay, and patients with mediastinal bleeding had a longer hos\ufffepital stay.\nOur study recognized that the role of ECMO support has \nemerged as a preoperative bridge-to-transplantation as well as \na postoperative bridge-to-recovery. Out of seven patients who \nreceived preoperative ECMO support and were bridged to \ntransplantation, no one had postoperative mortality, and all of\nthem had successful recovery after transplantation. Only one \ncase of early mortality was reported in the postoperative \nECMO group (patient 2 in Table 3); the remaining three pa\ufffetients were successfully bridged to recovery. The successful \noutcome of using ECMO as a preoperative bridge-to-trans\ufffeplantation and postoperative bridge-to-recovery indicates that \nECMO support can be a viable option for managing pre\ufffeoperative end-stage heart failure patients and improving sur\ufffevival, particularly when compared with the general outcomes \nof ECMO support after major cardiac surgery. In addition, \ngiven the situation in Korea where ventricular assist device \nimplantation is not generalized for patients with a failing \nheart [19] and ECMO support may be the only alternative \noption, the number of patients on the waiting list who may \nneed preoperative ECMO support is expected to increase over \ntime.",

Because of the painful shortage of donor hearts, this\ndiscussion is likewise recommended even when patients\nare potential candidates for heart transplantation.\nIndication for heart transplantation\nThe main indication of HTx is persistent advanced chronic\nheart failure despite optimal medical treatment of left\nventricular dysfunction. For candidacy, the patients will\nhave to fulfill various criteria (table 1) with cardiopulmon\ufffeary exercise testing playing the central role. Nevertheless,\nthe decision on a candidacy for HTx should take into ac\ufffecount all clinical data rather than focusing on peak oxygen\nuptake alone [3], and, usually, is obtained after multidiscip\ufffelinary discussion.\nThe timing of referral is of central importance and, ideally,\npotential HTx candidates should be presented to a respect\ufffeive centre ahead of the manifestation of other organ dys\ufffefunctions related to heart failure (e.g., cardiorenal syn\ufffedrome, pulmonary hypertension, liver dysfunction, meta\ufffebolic syndrome). Indicators that should prompt considera\ufffetion for referral are indicated in table 2.\nTable 1: Criteria for heart transplantation.\nCommon criteria\n1.

Therefore, other organ\ndysfunction not likely to improve, posttransplant, may pre\ufffeclude HTx in the individual patient. In contrast, other organ\ndysfunction often does not preclude HTx if related with the\nseverity of HF and thus likely to improve after HTx.\nAdvanced heart failure is most often associated with renal,\nhepatic, pulmonary, and metabolic dysfunction.

All rights reserved. www.annalscts.com Ann Cardiothorac Surg 2018;7(1):75-81\nThe use of NRP allowing for a comprehensive functional \nassessment of cardiac function with data obtained \nfrom the pulmonary floatation catheter (PAFC) and \ntrans-oesophageal echocardiography has allowed for \nthis relatively short interval to be extended without \ncompromising transplant outcomes (19). Additionally, the \nconfidence provided by functional assessment has allowed \nfor the inclusion of older donors, thus further expanding \nthe potential donor pool. An early review describing the \ninternational experience of DCD heart transplantation to\ufffedate, highlighted that there was no significant difference in \nmortality between the two techniques (21). However, from \na health-economics perspective, it did highlight that the \npercentage conversion of hearts perfused on the OCS that \nproceeded to transplantation was higher in those who had \nbeen assessed on NRP, allowing for a significant cost-saving. \nMore recently, a timely study published by Messer et al.\ncoinciding with the 50th anniversary of heart transplantation \nfurther confirms these findings (23). More importantly, \nthey address the question of transplant outcomes of DCD \nhearts in comparison to the current gold-standard of DBD \nheart transplants. In a matched comparison, they found \nno significant difference in survival with a reported 92% \n90-day survival in the DCD group (n=26) with no \ndifferences in intensive care duration, length of hospital stay \nor the need for mechanical support. Interestingly, they did \nreport better early cardiac function of the DCD allografts \ncompared with the matched DBD cohort.\nEthical considerations\nThe use of NRP is not possible in certain countries due \nto the many varying legal definitions of death that exist \nglobally. In the UK, current practice is based on the code \nof practice guidelines published by the Academy of Medical \nRoyal Colleges (20). These guidelines allow for the use \nof NRP and for perfusion of the heart to be restarted \nwithin the donor provided that cerebral circulation is not \nrestored. There are other legislative differences that exist \nin the process of declaration of death internationally. In the \nUK, a period of 5 minutes after mechanical asystole has \nto be allowed prior to the declaration of death, whereas in \nAustralia this time period varies between 3 to 5 minutes \nand in the paediatric cohort in Colorado was reduced to \n75 seconds. Furthermore, the use of ante-mortem \ninterventions such as ante-mortem heparin, while \nroutinely practiced for DCD retrievals in some countries is \nunacceptable in the UK. \nCo-location of the donor and recipient, while an \nexceptionally rare occurrence, has been intentionally \nemployed to facilitate paediatric DCD transplantation (17). \nHowever, this is not a strategy that is routinely acceptable \nin many other countries on ethical and logistic grounds \ndespite the proposed clinical benefits. \nFuture work\nAlthough DCD heart transplantation has been shown \nto be a viable source of good quality donor hearts, there \nremains a lot of work that needs to be done to optimise \nthis resource and allow patients to fully benefit from this \nprocedure. Significant work has already been done in \nusing post-conditioning agents on an ex-situ platform of \nperfusion to allow for better post-transplant outcome using \npharmacological agents which has already translated into \nclinical practice (24). However, apart from using NRP, \nthere remains significant doubt on the reliability of organ \nassessment on the OCS which is currently based on the \nuse of lactate as a surrogate for organ quality together \nwith flow parameters (25,26). Additionally, as with DBD \ntransplantation, primary graft dysfunction (PGD) remains \nan issue and the platform of ex-situ perfusion allows for an",

To date, over 100 DCD heart transplants\nhave been performed using a cardiac perfusion system (107), and\nMP of hearts exhibited safe preservation in RCTs (108).\nEX VIVO MONITORING OF ORGAN\nFUNCTION AND QUALITY\nCurrently, the decision as to whether organs are suitable for\ntransplantation is determined on the basis of more or less\nsubjective empirically established clinical parameters that have\nbeen shown to be associated with an increased rate of early\nallograft dysfunction or graft failure. Parameters such as donor\npast medical history, last known laboratory values, findings\nduring procurement, and other procurement variables such as\nexpected ischemia times primarily determine the acceptability\nof a graft. These parameters include prolonged warm ischemia\ntime (WIT) >30 min during DCD, prolonged CIT, and\nparenchymal alterations within the graft (e.g., steatosis, fibrosis,\narteriosclerosis). Viability testing and functional assessment\nprior to transplantation are likely to extend the utilization of\nsuboptimal or marginal organs (109\u2013111).\nHMP is an alternative method to standard SCS for the\npreservation of organs. For different types of kidney grafts, HMP\noffers superior preservation compared with SCS. In terms of graft\nquality assessment during HMP, some biochemical parameters of\nthe released perfusate and hydrodynamic parameters are found\nto independently correlate with the outcome\u2014a finding that may\nhelp clinicians in their decision making.\nIncreased Glutathione S-Tranferase (GST), N-acetyl-beta-D\ufffeglucosaminidase (NAG), heart-type fatty acid-binding protein\n(H-FABP), or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations\nduring MP may serve as indicators for suboptimal graft quality.\nFurthermore, levels of redox-active iron measured in the\nperfusate have been correlated with DGF rates (112\u2013114).\nMoreover, the measurement of vascular resistance during MP\nrepresents an additional and objective source of information\nthat can assist clinicians in their decision-making process.\nHigh vascular resistance as a hydrodynamic parameter has\nbeen shown to be associated with an increased risk of DGF\ndevelopment and predictive for 1-year graft failure (115\u2013117).\nTaken together, to date, increased vascular resistance and high\ninjury marker concentrations in the perfusate are risk factors for\nDGF and helpful parameters, but they are not accurate enough\nto justify a decision for discard based on their interpretation\nalone (112\u2013114, 117).\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 10 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 631",
