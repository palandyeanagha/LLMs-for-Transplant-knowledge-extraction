Whereas, static cold storage (SCS) has been successfully applied over decades with\ngood outcomes in standard criteria donor (SCD) organs, at present, marginal or expanded criteria donor (ECD) organs in particular are increasingly preserved by\nhypothermic (HMP) or normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) technologies. After initial cold perfusion [*and optimally following normothermic regional perfusion\n(NRP) in Donation after cardiac death (DCD) organs], machine perfusion is commenced either at the retrieval center or at the transplant center in a \u201cback to hub\u201d\napproach. The next step is to effectively use the prolonged preservation times of ECD grafts achieved by optimized machine perfusion protocols to characterize ECD\norgan quality and transplantability via the assessment of biomarkers. To improve graft quality, NMP provides an ideal platform for future immunomodulatory\nmodifications and organ repair.\nso far), hypothermic preservation with/without oxygen, and\nnormothermic perfusion. Normothermic regional perfusion\n(NRP) is mentioned in Figure 1, as it has become an important\ntool for use before the procurement process of DCD starts. The\nfollowing sections will not present NRP data in particular, as the\nreview is about machine preservation in marginal donor organs.\nHowever, good and satisfying results after kidney, pancreas,\nheart, and liver transplantation were reported by several groups\nin the United Kingdom, Spain, and France and have been\nsummarized by previous reviews (37\u201342).\nRecently, Ruiz et al. presented a series of 46 livers transplanted\nafter NRP and concluded that their results, including 23%\nearly allograft dysfunction, are superior to standard DCD organ\nprocurements and comparable to donation after brain death\n(DBD) results (43). The Cambridge group (United Kingdom),\nclear NRP proponents, commented on this publication in a way\nsimilar to our suggestions illustrated in Figure 1. The publication\nby Ruiz et al. (43), like many others before it, did not compare the\nresults to an adequate prospectively organized control group.\nIt is noteworthy that, only recently, a protocol for NRP\nwas established even for DCD heart transplantation. Due to a\nrestoration of function of the arrested heart, organ assessment via\nechocardiography, pressure-volume loops, and cardiac-output\nmeasurements could be implemented (44).\nAccepted criteria for subsequent heart transplantation after\nweaning from mechanical support are defined as: cardiac\nindex >2.5 L/min/m2\n; central venous pressure < 12 mm Hg;\npulmonary capillary wedge pressure < 12 mm Hg; left ventricular\nejection fraction > 50% in transoesophageal echocardiography.\nNRP leads to a meaningful increment of survival benefits and\nhelps to enlarge the available donor pool by utilizing marginal\ndonor organs in a safe way (45, 46). Future trials are needed to\ncompare DCD organ transplantation +/\u2013 NRP followed by +/\u2013\na combination of preservation techniques (42, 45).\nSince 2009, dynamic cold storage\u2014hypothermic machine\nperfusion (HMP)\u2014has progressed to become clinical routine in\nseveral fields of SOT\u2014above all, in kidney preservation. Moers\net al. published their landmark paper in the New England Journal\nof Medicine and demonstrated a significantly lowered DGF\nrate in recipients receiving a hypothermically perfused kidney\ncompared to a renal graft stored on ice in the common way\n(47). Applying the same technology (HMP without supplemental\noxygenation), numerous publications on DCD and ECD kidneys\nhave followed over the past 10 years, showing similar results:\nECD and DCD kidneys and their recipients clearly benefit from\nMP as long as the duration of cold ischemia time (CIT) is\nreasonable (48\u201352). During the second half of the recent decade,\noxygen as a supplement has been focused on for kidney HMP.\nIn 2016, Jochmans et al. published an overview of ongoing",

Ex-vivo lung perfusion \n(EVLP) offers the ability to expand the number of useable lung grafts through assessment and reconditioning \nof explanted lungs, particularly those not initially meeting criteria for transplantation. This meta-analysis \naimed to examine the mid- to long-term survival and other short-term outcomes of patients transplanted \nwith EVLP-treated lungs versus standard/cold-storage protocol lungs.\nMethods: Literature search of ten medical databases was conducted for original studies involving \u201cex-vivo \nlung perfusion\u201d and \u201cEVLP\u201d. Included articles were assessed by two independent researchers, survival data \nfrom Kaplan-Meier curves digitized, and individual patient data imputed to conduct aggregated survival \nanalysis. Meta-analyses of suitably reported outcomes were conducted using a random-effects model.\nResults: Thirteen studies met inclusion criteria, with a total of 407 EVLP lung transplants and 1,765 as \nper standard/cold storage protocol. One study was a randomized controlled trial while the remainder were \nsingle-institution cohort series of varying design. The majority of donor lungs were from brain death donors, \nwith EVLP lungs having significantly worse PaO2/FiO2 ratio and significantly greater rate of abnormal \nchest X-ray. Aggregated survival analysis of all included studies revealed no significant survival difference for \nEVLP or standard protocol lungs (hazard ratio 1.00; 95% confidence interval: 0.79\u20131.27, P=0.981). Survival \nat 12, 24, and 36 months for the EVLP cohort was 84%, 79%, and 74%, respectively. Survival at 12, 24, and \n36 months for the standard protocol cohort was 85%, 79%, and 73%, respectively.

The incidence of 30-day mortality and primary \ngraft dysfunction grade 3 at 72 hours did not differ significantly between groups.

Ann Cardiothorac Surg 2020;9(1):1-9 | http://dx.doi.org/10.21037/acs.2020.01.02\nIntroduction\nWhile lung transplantation (LTx) for patients with end\ufffestage pulmonary disease can be a life-saving measure, the \nscarcity of suitable donor lungs results in up to 30% of these \npatients dying while on the waiting list (1,2). Obtaining \ndonor organs for LTx is particularly problematic, with \ndonors of at least one other solid organ only having suitable \nlungs in 15\u201330% of cases according to current assessment \ncriteria (3-5). End-of-life care, be it in the intensive care \nunit or otherwise, often results in damage to potential grafts \nand even under optimal donor circumstances, brain death \nstill has the deleterious effect of causing neurogenic edema \nand a cytokine storm-induced inflammatory response (6). \nStandard transplant protocols developed and refined \nsince the 1960\u2019s involve infusion of the donor lung with \na specially formulated perfusate before inflation of the \nlung, stapling of the trachea, and cold preservation until \ntransplantation (7). In contrast, ex-vivo lung perfusion \n(EVLP) involves continuous ventilation and perfusion of \ndonor lungs, offering the potential to both extend the ability \nto functionally assess grafts, as well as recondition them \nto a transplant-suitable standard, thereby expanding the \navailable pool of grafts (8). EVLP can be administered via \nseveral different established protocols which vary perfusate \ncomposition, flow, temperature, pressure, and ventilation, \nwith off-the-shelf EVLP equipment such as the \u201cXVIVO \nPerfusion System (XPS)\u201d, \u201cOrgan Care System (OCS)\u201d, \nand \u201cVivoline LS-1\u201d now on the market (1).\nWhile extended-criteria lungs have been shown to \nhave comparable follow-up survival outcomes to standard \ncriteria lungs using standard lung transplant methods, the \nuse of EVLP to further expand the donor pool raises the \nquestion of EVLP recipient long-term outcomes (3,8,9). \nThe objective of this meta-analysis was to aggregate mid\ufffeto long-term survival data and available post-operative \noutcomes from studies comparing LTx recipients who \nreceived EVLP treated grafts to those receiving standard \nprotocol (cold-preservation) grafts.\nMethods\nLiterature search\nTen medical literature databases were queried from their \ndates of inception to August 2019. These included Medline, \nEmbase, PubMed, and the Ovid \u201cEvidence-Based Medicine \nReviews\u201d collection, which includes the Cochrane databases, \nas well as national college and government repositories. A \nbroad search strategy was deliberately used, using terms \n\u201cex-vivo lung perfusion\u201d (as a whole term and individually) \nand \u201cEVLP\u201d.\nTwo independent researchers (P.F. and B.M.) screened \nreference list results and full texts, with inclusion at each \nstage determined by consensus with the senior researcher \n(A.C.). Studies were included if they were comparative \nstudies reporting primary mid- to long-term outcome data \nfor recipients after lung transplant using standard protocol \nor EVLP. Studies needed to include at least five transplant \nrecipients per arm. Non-comparative studies, animal studies, \ncase reports, conference abstracts, reviews, and editorials were \nexcluded.

The \nreference list of all included studies was examined to identify \nfurther articles meeting the inclusion criteria.\nThe primary endpoint was overall Kaplan-Meier survival \nreported to at least 6-months. Secondary endpoints were \ndetermined as those reported in at least half of included \nstudies and included 30-day mortality, post-operative graft \ndysfunction grade 3 at 72 h, intensive care unit length of \nstay (LOS), and hospital LOS.\nQuality analysis\nA 19-point metric adopted from the Canadian Institute",

All rights reserved. www.annalscts.com Ann Cardiothorac Surg 2018;7(1):75-81\nThe use of NRP allowing for a comprehensive functional \nassessment of cardiac function with data obtained \nfrom the pulmonary floatation catheter (PAFC) and \ntrans-oesophageal echocardiography has allowed for \nthis relatively short interval to be extended without \ncompromising transplant outcomes (19). Additionally, the \nconfidence provided by functional assessment has allowed \nfor the inclusion of older donors, thus further expanding \nthe potential donor pool. An early review describing the \ninternational experience of DCD heart transplantation to\ufffedate, highlighted that there was no significant difference in \nmortality between the two techniques (21). However, from \na health-economics perspective, it did highlight that the \npercentage conversion of hearts perfused on the OCS that \nproceeded to transplantation was higher in those who had \nbeen assessed on NRP, allowing for a significant cost-saving. \nMore recently, a timely study published by Messer et al.\ncoinciding with the 50th anniversary of heart transplantation \nfurther confirms these findings (23). More importantly, \nthey address the question of transplant outcomes of DCD \nhearts in comparison to the current gold-standard of DBD \nheart transplants. In a matched comparison, they found \nno significant difference in survival with a reported 92% \n90-day survival in the DCD group (n=26) with no \ndifferences in intensive care duration, length of hospital stay \nor the need for mechanical support. Interestingly, they did \nreport better early cardiac function of the DCD allografts \ncompared with the matched DBD cohort.\nEthical considerations\nThe use of NRP is not possible in certain countries due \nto the many varying legal definitions of death that exist \nglobally. In the UK, current practice is based on the code \nof practice guidelines published by the Academy of Medical \nRoyal Colleges (20). These guidelines allow for the use \nof NRP and for perfusion of the heart to be restarted \nwithin the donor provided that cerebral circulation is not \nrestored. There are other legislative differences that exist \nin the process of declaration of death internationally. In the \nUK, a period of 5 minutes after mechanical asystole has \nto be allowed prior to the declaration of death, whereas in \nAustralia this time period varies between 3 to 5 minutes \nand in the paediatric cohort in Colorado was reduced to \n75 seconds. Furthermore, the use of ante-mortem \ninterventions such as ante-mortem heparin, while \nroutinely practiced for DCD retrievals in some countries is \nunacceptable in the UK. \nCo-location of the donor and recipient, while an \nexceptionally rare occurrence, has been intentionally \nemployed to facilitate paediatric DCD transplantation (17). \nHowever, this is not a strategy that is routinely acceptable \nin many other countries on ethical and logistic grounds \ndespite the proposed clinical benefits. \nFuture work\nAlthough DCD heart transplantation has been shown \nto be a viable source of good quality donor hearts, there \nremains a lot of work that needs to be done to optimise \nthis resource and allow patients to fully benefit from this \nprocedure. Significant work has already been done in \nusing post-conditioning agents on an ex-situ platform of \nperfusion to allow for better post-transplant outcome using \npharmacological agents which has already translated into \nclinical practice (24). However, apart from using NRP, \nthere remains significant doubt on the reliability of organ \nassessment on the OCS which is currently based on the \nuse of lactate as a surrogate for organ quality together \nwith flow parameters (25,26). Additionally, as with DBD \ntransplantation, primary graft dysfunction (PGD) remains \nan issue and the platform of ex-situ perfusion allows for an",

Ann Cardiothorac Surg 2020;9(1):1-9 | http://dx.doi.org/10.21037/acs.2020.01.02\nthe real possibility of EVLP to reduce the number of lung \ntransplant wait-list deaths. Additionally, it adds weight to \nthe argument that satisfactory results can be obtained with \nmore than one EVLP protocol (22).\nThis meta-analysis is potentially limited by it being \nlargely comprised of institutional series, however, RCT in \nthis area are difficult since transplanting initially rejected \nor marginal (beyond extended criteria) donor lungs as \na control arm would be ethically difficult to justify (21). \nAlthough statistical heterogeneity was low in meta-analysis \nendpoints, it remained moderate to high for some baseline \nand intraoperative characteristics. This heterogeneity is \nlikely due to differences in centers\u2019 donor criteria and \noperative methods (for example, single versus double lung), \nand sensitivity analysis did not demonstrate an effect on \nsignificance of outcomes. This does not however, mean \nthat all sources of heterogeneity were able to be accounted \nfor and the authors acknowledge that even where I2\n point \nvalues were low, I2\n confidence intervals often still included \nat least moderate heterogeneity values (16). Additionally, \nmany studies were retrospective and included a range of \nrecruitment years and recruitment period lengths. As EVLP \nmethodology and knowledge (and lung transplant more \nbroadly) is a rapidly-evolving field, this may have introduced \nsome learning-curve type confounding effect (25).\nConclusions\nAggregated patient survival data analysis of EVLP \nand standard/cold-storage lung transplant recipients \ndemonstrated no significant difference in survival at mid\ufffeto long-term follow-up. Meta-analysis demonstrated lungs \naccepted for EVLP had significantly lower PaO2/FiO2\nratio and a greater incidence of radiographic abnormality, \nhowever, this did not translate to a significant difference \nin overall survival, 30-day mortality, or primary graft \ndysfunction grade 3 at 72 h between EVLP and standard \ncohorts. EVLP offers the ability to expand the lung donor \npool with acceptable mid- to long-term survival outcomes.\nAcknowledgments\nNone.\nFootnote\nConflicts of Interest: The authors have no conflicts of interest \nto declare.\nReferences\n1.
