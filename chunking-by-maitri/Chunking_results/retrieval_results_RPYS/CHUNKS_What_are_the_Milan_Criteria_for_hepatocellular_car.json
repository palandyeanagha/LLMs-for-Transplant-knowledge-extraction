Liver transplantation is an optimal \ntreatment option for early stage, unresectable \nhepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis \nbecause it treats the underlying cirrhosis as well as \nhepatocellular carcinoma and is associated with a \nsignificantly reduced incidence of recurrent cancer \ncompared with alternative treatment strategies. Liver \ntransplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma within \nthe Milan criteria (one lesion between 3 and 5 cm, or \ntwo to three lesions between 1 and 3 cm) has been \nlong established as the standard criteria for patient \nselection.65 Based on the success of the Milan criteria, \nadditional proposals to allow access for patients \nwith larger tumors have been developed. The most \nwell known of these are the University of California, \nSan Francisco (UCSF) criteria (81% survival at five \nyears), up-to-seven criteria (71% survival at five \nyears), total tumor volume (75% survival at four \nyears), extended Toronto criteria (68% survival at \nfive years), and Kyoto criteria (65% survival at five \nyears).66-70 Each proposal expands the selection \ncriteria, allowing more patients to be considered for \nliver transplantation, while showing reduced but \nexcellent long term outcomes after transplantation.\nThe primary limitation of liver transplantation \nfor hepatocellular carcinoma is the critical shortage \nof available liver allografts, and thus the patient\u2019s \nsurvival without timely access to transplantation as \nwell as the expected survival after transplantation \nmust be considered, which is best estimated \nby disease burden. In the US, patients with \nhepatocellular carcinoma, with \u03b1 fetoprotein lower \nthan 1000 ng/mL, and who are either within Milan \ncriteria or downstaged to within Milan criteria from \nspecific downstaging criteria (up to five lesions, sum \nof lesion diameters <8 cm) are eligible to receive \nadditional waitlist priority after a six month waiting \nperiod.71 72 Since May 2019, patients receive a fixed \nscore 3 points lower than the median MELD (model \nfor end-stage liver disease) at transplant (MMaT-3) for \nthe area of distribution where they are listed, which \nis currently based on a concentric circle model.72\nThe primary goal of MMaT-3 is to assign a score \nthat is adjusted according to the score required \nto access transplantation in the area where the \npatient is listed, given the differences around the \nUS in access to transplantation. A secondary goal \nis to manage the observed and continued rise in the \nMELD score at transplantation over the past decade, \nwhich is thought to be potentially related to the \nprior system of stepwise increases in the exception \nMELD score granted every three months to patients \nwith hepatocellular carcinoma awaiting liver Protected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n.

The incidence of HCC has been\nrising in the USA over the last 20 years. Liver transplanta\ufffetion is an optimal treatment option, as it eliminates HCC as\nwell as the underlying liver disease. The Milan criteria\n(1 lesion greater than or equal to 2 cm and less than or\nequal to 5 cm, or up to 3 lesions, each greater than or equal\nto 1 cm and less than or equal to 3 cm) have been adopted\nby many transplant societies worldwide as the criteria to\ndetermine whether patients with HCC can move forward\nwith liver transplantation. However, many believe that the\nMilan criteria may be too strict in regard to its size require\ufffements for lesions. This has led to a number of expanded\ncriteria for liver transplantation, concerning both overall\nsize and number of lesions, as well as incorporation of other\nmarkers of tumor biology. Tumor markers, such as alpha\ufffefetoprotein, can also be used to follow treatment of HCC and\npossibly exclude patients from transplant. HCC presenting\nbeyond Milan criteria can also be down-staged with locore\ufffegional therapy. Monitoring response to locoregional therapy\nand longer wait times after locoregional therapy prior to\ntransplant can serve as surrogate markers of tumor biology\nas well.\nCitation of this article: Lingiah VA, Niazi M, Olivo R, Pa\ufffeterno F, Guarrera JV, Pyrsopoulos NT.

Liver transplant is an excellent therapeutic\noption for long-term survival in patients with HCC, as it\neliminates both HCC and the underlying advanced liver\ndisease.2 Initially, poor patient selection (advanced tumor\nburden, unclear tumor etiology) resulted in high rates of\ntumor recurrence post-transplant.6 This changed in 1996\nwhen Mazzaferro and colleagues7 showed 75% 4-year sur\ufffevival rate and 83% recurrence-free survival rate, utilizing\ntheir now well-known Milan criteria. These criteria (one\nlesion greater than or equal to 2 cm and less than or equal\nto 5 cm, or up to 3 lesions, each greater than or equal to 1 cm\nand less than or equal to 3 cm, with no evidence of vascular\ninvasion or extra-hepatic metastases) showed comparable\nsurvival outcomes compared to transplants performed on\npatients with cirrhosis but without HCC.\nThe Milan criteria have seen widespread approval and have\nbeen incorporated into the United Network for Organ Sharing\n(UNOS) criteria since 2002, for listing patients with HCC for\nliver transplant.

        "text": "Background\nIn 1996, Mazzaferro et al. reported that when liver trans\ufffeplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was re\ufffestricted to patients with early-stage disease (defined as a\nsingle tumor less than 5 cm in diameter, or up to three\ntumors less than 3 cm in diameter, without vascular in\ufffevasion or extrahepatic metastasis), the 4-year survival\nrate was 75%, similar to survival rates for patients with\nnon-HCC liver disease [1]. These criteria, which were\nsoon termed the \u201cMilan criteria,\u201d became the worldwide\nbenchmark for liver transplantation criteria for HCC.\nThe Milan criteria, limiting the indications for liver\ntransplantation for HCC, have reduced the postoperative\nrecurrence rate of HCC. However, HCC still recurs in\n1.6\u201313% of recipients within the Milan criteria after liver\ntransplantation [1\u20136]. There have been many reports of\ncases with multiple instances of recurrence due to sys\ufffetemic recurrence caused by extra-hepatic circulating\ntumor cells. The prognosis after recurrence of HCC is\npoor, with reported median survival ranging from 9 to\n19 months in major transplant centers in both Western\nand Eastern countries [4, 7\u201312]. However, if the recur\uffference remains local, such as within the liver, lung, or ad\uffferenal gland, surgical resection may improve prognosis,\nand cases of long-term survival have been reported [4,\n6\u20138, 10, 11, 13]. Here, we report a case of long-term sur\ufffevival after resection of the pharyngeal metastasis due to\nHCC recurrence after living-donor liver transplantation\n(LDLT).\nCase presentation\nA 47-year-old man with a Model End-stage Liver Dis\ufffeease (MELD) score of 11 and liver cirrhosis associated\nwith hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection underwent LDLT\nfor HCC, with his 48-year-old elder brother as the living\ndonor, in November 2004. He had received transarterial\nchemoembolization (TACE) 5 months before liver trans\ufffeplantation and was assessed as having a partial response\naccording to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria\nin Solid Tumors (mRECIST) [14]. The patient had no\nhistory of other diseases, and there were also no diseases\nof note in his family history. The right lobe of the donor\nwas harvested and weighed 710 g (graft-to-recipient\nweight ratio, 1.09). The donor and recipient had the\nsame blood type. Preoperative abdominal computed\ntomography (CT) revealed liver cirrhosis with three\nhypervascular nodules, diagnosed as HCC, which were\n2.0, 2.5, and 2.8 cm in diameter and met the Milan cri\ufffeteria (Fig. 1a). Preoperative tumor marker levels were as\nfollows: \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP), 5 ng/ml; and des- -\nFig. 1 Computed tomography (CT) images before living-donor liver transplantation and histopathological findings of the resected native liver. a\nPreoperative abdominal CT showing liver cirrhosis with three hypervascular nodules that were 20, 25, and 28 mm in diameter.

The criteria are traditionally\nassessed by contrast CT, which is known to be affected by\nstructural or architectural changes in cirrhotic livers. We aimed\nto compare dual-tracer (11C-acetate and 18F-FDG) PET/CT with\ncontrast CT for patient selection on the basis of the Milan cri\ufffeteria. Methods: Patients who had HCC and had undergone\nboth preoperative dual-tracer PET/CT and contrast CT within\na 1-mo interval were retrospectively studied. They then under\ufffewent either LT (n 5 22) or partial hepatectomy (PH) (n 5 21;\nHCC of # 8 cm). Imaging data were compared with data from\npostoperative pathologic analysis for accuracy in assessment\nof parameters specified by the Milan criteria (tumor size and\nextent, vascular invasion, and metastasis), TNM staging, and\npatient selection for LT. Results: Dual-tracer PET/CT per\ufffeformed equally well in both LT and PH groups for HCC detec\ufffetion (94.1% vs. 95.8%) and TNM staging (90.9% vs. 90.5%).\nContrast CT performed reasonably well in the LT group but not\nin the PH group for HCC detection (67.6% vs. 37.5%) and TNM\nstaging (54.5% vs. 28.6%). In the LT group, the sensitivity and\nspecificity of contrast CT for patient selection on the basis of\nthe Milan criteria were 43.8% and 66.7%, respectively (compa\uffferable to values in the literature); the sensitivity and specificity of\ndual-tracer PET/CT were 93.8% and 100%, respectively (both\nPs , 0.05). From the surgeon\u2019s perspective, we tended to per\ufffeform transplantation for patients with higher diagnostic certainty\n(stricter CT criteria) because of a shortage of donor grafts.\nPatients who were not transplant candidates usually underwent\nup-front hepatectomy without the benefit of reassessment con\ufffetrast CT, resulting in lower accuracies for the PH group. The\noverall sensitivity (96.8%) and specificity (91.7%) of dual-tracer\nPET/CT for patient selection for LT were significantly higher\nthan those of contrast CT (41.9% and 33.0%, respectively)\n(both Ps , 0.05). Sources of error for contrast CT were related\nto cirrhosis or previous treatment and included difficulty in\ndifferentiating cirrhotic nodules from HCC (39%) and estima\ufffetion of tumor size (14%). Overstaging of vascular invasion (4.6%)\nand extrahepatic metastases (4.6%) was infrequent. The rate\nof false-negative results of dual-tracer PET/CT was 4.7%.\nConclusion: Dual-tracer PET/CT was significantly less affected\nby cirrhotic changes than contrast CT for HCC staging and\npatient selection for LT on the basis of the Milan criteria. The\ninclusion of dual-tracer PET/CT in pretransplant workup may\nwarrant serious consideration.\nKey Words: liver transplantation; Milan criteria; 11C-acetate;\nPET/CT; contrast CT\nJ Nucl Med 2013; 54:192\u2013200\nDOI: 10.2967/jnumed.112.107516\nSurgical treatment offers the best chance of cure for pa\ufffetients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
